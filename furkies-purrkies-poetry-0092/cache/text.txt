Don't take shortcuts,
all shortcuts end abruptly.
You can't pretend,
what you pretend, can't ever become real.
A life without Authenticity,
will forever feel like chaos.

You have no choice, but to Rise,
to Emerge, in Majestic Authenticity.
To build and reinforce your Content of Character,
to pursue Wisdom and Excellence.
To Be You.
To Feel Meaning.

Growing Up has always been a Great Challenge.
it has never been easy.
Growing Up is the first, and foremost, and most important,
and should life crumble, you will rebuild.

Don't worry, you are not wasting time Growing Up,
it matters not how you step forward, just that you do.
The result is the same, Content of Character, Strength,
Joy, Love, Happiness, Adventure, and Foolishness,
to name a few.

Not only is this the only way to live,
but it is also the only way for the World to Learn.
Humans cannot be led outside in,
they must be taught to lead, inside out.
The recipe for your own Growing Up,
is also the recipe for a Wise World.

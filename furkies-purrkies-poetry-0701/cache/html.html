  <p>The name of species is crowned with the word:<br>wise, as in Wise Beings.</p>
  <p>Wisdom separates us,<br>from all the other animals.</p>
  <p>Without wisdom we are almost lost,<br>we are forced into confusion, and reliance of most basic skills.</p>

  <p>Throughout history, it was well known,<br>that to control people, one merely needs to deny them wisdom.</p>
  <p>This is the reason for book burning,<br>this is the reason for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AA1lGhtkoFc">laws meant to prevent education</a>.</p>
  <p>This is the reason,<br>why many religions replace knowledge with fantasy.</p>

  <p>Knowledge and resulting wisdom,<br>are as important to us as Oxygen.</p>
  <p>And that is the reason,<br>why many gave up their lives.</p>
  <p>This is the truth behind the story of Socrates,<br>without wisdom a life is not worth living.</p>

  <p>Lack of wisdom will corrupt our greatest works,<br>along with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWQ6_BQii_U">Police</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLahyYcu5BE">Judgges</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig">Politicians</a>.</p>
  <p>The only way to undo corruption, in a way that makes liars fail,<br>is by emphasizing the importance of wisdom.</p>
  <p>And by making schools effectively ignite it,<br>in the students.</p>

  <p>This is a way of solving problems before they happen,<br>and it is called prevention.</p>
  <p>Wisdom does not require schools,<br>it is just that schools can bring it to students as early as possible.</p>
  <p>Today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">schools are corrupt and malformed as well</a>,<br>but like with every thing else this is a matter of prevention.</p>

  <p>This means that before we can fix schools,<br>we have to emphasize self education that leads to wisdom.</p>
  <p>We all know schools as a rough or toxic place,<br>but real education pleasant, beautiful, happy and full of adventure.</p>
  <p>In this amazing age, we can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFjyOwGIWTU">borrow narrated books</a>,<br>or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gLfpotQdBs">download the classics for free</a>.</p>

  <p>It is very important to understand that listening and learning from great books,<br>is more important than pretending to pass tests by cramming in ineffective schools.</p>
  <p>Pretending to learn, has the same effect as being denied an education,<br>pretending is the reason why our greatest inventions are corrupt today.</p>
  <p>When the force of wisdom is removed from us,<br>we lose most of our abilities to comprehend, create, extend, and build.</p>

  <p>In out confusion,<br>we will blindly undo the work of the great beings that came before us.</p>

  <p>Most importantly know that wisdom is what we are good at,<br>not only do we greatly overestimate out distance to it, but we already have some within.</p>
  <p>There is a perfect road to wisdom,<br>that fills in all the blanks.</p>
  <p>A road that in no time,<br>restores our health, and sets all the things and priorities right.</p>

  <p>Wisdom is not something that you will discover in your memory or journals,<br>it is a new flame that is kindled within.</p>
  <p>It is an ever rising power of creativity, insight,<br>unbreakability, dignity, foresight, and courage.</p>
  <p>Once ignited, the flame can only spread and burn ever brighter,<br>it creates a force of prevention, a force that no liar nor corruption, will ever see coming.</p>

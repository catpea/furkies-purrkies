A work of art,
will grant great might.
By subtle analogy is a fine way to learn,
and grow wise in turn.
What we gain from art,
adds to make us smart.

Painting is not just about the masterpiece,
it is also about a mind at peace.
The song we compose to our own ear,
is different from what others hear.
And nobody sculpts something to trigger a felling,
one sculpts for expression, and healing.

The audience sees something more distant,
but the artist is infinity precise and consistent.

Art teaches insight,
and increases our apatite.
Wherever you start,
you will want to expand your art.
No writer can resist writing verse,
though it is not guaranteed to be terse.
Likewise no writer can resist,
sculpture, painting, music composition with a twist.

No artist just sits in one place,
they always need more space.
A canvas here,
an armature there.
An audio workstation,
a recording studio for their narration.
A computer for programming and math,
a wall full of diagrams to mark the path.
3D printer and an art projector,
the artist becomes a collector.

And yet is all the same,
wisdom is still wisdom my any other name.
To divide the two apart,
know that artist does not make art.
It is art that makes an artist grow,
and they never do it for the show.

All of us should create art,
and the source, the source, is always heart.
There is this beautiful question when beginning art:
"Where will you start?"

  <p>Or You can open up your reference photo in GIMP,<br>and adjust the color temperature.</p>
  <p>Or you can challenge yourself to a vision quest,<br>by desaturating your reference photo completely.</p>
  <p>Mixing the color from scratch may feel relatively counterproductive,<br>but it may lead you to a series of simplified portraits, or color studies.</p>
  <p>Where you for example just use three variations of a color dark, medium and light,<br>instead of a full palette, which will force you into more abstract creations.</p>

  <p>Here, my reluctance towards hand drawn portraits,<br>really comes to the surface.</p>
  <p>People looking to purchase a keepsake,<br>may not be interested in the artist’s own impression.</p>
  <p>I think maybe,<br>this is the root of the starving artist.</p>
  <p>Imagine that you wish to purchase a portrait.<br>of a dear family member.</p>
  <p>Someone who always cared about you,<br>and helped you in life.</p>
  <p>Do you want the artist’s hand between you,<br>and your loved one.</p>
  <p>Or do you just want,<br>a perfect, beautiful portrait.</p>
  <p>That captures,<br>how you see your loved one with your heart.</p>

  <p>The problem of the artist’s hand has gotten so bad,<br>that nobody thinks about portraits anymore.</p>
  <p>I should clarify that...<br>I do not blame the artists.</p>
  <p>It is the teachers that in their incompetence,<br>reinforced some terrible ideas about art, just to keep students busy in class.</p>

  <p>Forget the starving artist nonsense,<br>you are Royalty, you are a Hyperrealist.</p>
  <p>Begin with nine perfect portraits, and a small display of the reference photos,<br>and time-lapse (or just progress screenshots, or layers you use).</p>
  <p>You deliver it to your potential client,<br>and they immediately understand what they will get from you.</p>
  <p>Personally I think realistic portraits should start at $1,000 dollars and sometimes carry on past $20,000,<br>this immediately tells your customer everything they need to know about folks selling portraits for $50 or a $100 bucks.</p>

  <p>While you are waiting for clients,<br>you work on expanding and improving your art portfolio.</p>
  <p>You work on your coffee-table book,<br>and the art-book that tells your story.</p>
  <p>And you continue improving your online lectures,<br>covering more and more; as you learn more.</p>
  <p>You should have a photography website,<br>and consider selling time-lapse videos of nature, as a camera is on $50.</p>
  <p>Take time to record eight or twelve hour scenes<br>of summer days turning to night.</p>
  <p>Capturing the symphony of insects, birds,<br>trees and weather.</p>

  <p>The customers that recognize the quality of your work,<br>will have no problem waiting for you to finish existing work.</p>

  <p>Hyperrealism is both a teacher,<br>and a way out of poverty.</p>
  <p>Or at the very least,<br>a way to push away fears, brought on by poverty, away.</p>
  <p>Art is part of our heart,<br>it will teach and protect.</p>

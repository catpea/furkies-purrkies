There is no normal way
to say:
To me, of course,
a Deer is like a little horse.
Since I like them a lot,
I had a wonderful thought.
I'd grab my phone and go,
take a photo.

I had to bicycle from my driveway,
all the way out to the highway.
And since they eat dinner at eight,
I had to hurry as not to be late.

(read super fast)
I arrived just on time,
hit the brake, stopped on a dime.
Got my phone out,
did a little turnabout.
And click... click, click, click,
didn't even need a selfie stick.

Say hello,
perfect photo.
And I took a few more,
just to be sure.
I really had a ball,
so decided I'd upload them all.

On my way back,
I had a little snack.
And pondered my rhyme,
to finish my poem on time.
I rate my adventure as ten out of ten,
"will do again"

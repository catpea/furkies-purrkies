class=\"paragraph\">There were no troubles there,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so I had a lot of fun.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I used to make proper little bonfires,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">out of the branches that fell from the wind.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I tried to figure out how the world works,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">from up there.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I figured,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it wasn't working very well.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I grew up in a country with protests,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">shortages, and probably a lot of corruption.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When I was eight, the Chernobyl disaster struck,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">people were told to stay home behind concrete walls.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I remember people reminding each other not to pick up mushrooms,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">as they had something to do with radiation.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There was a strange man on TV Anatoly Kashpirovsky,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and people were pretending that he was healing them.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Some said that after they warmed up the gunk in their Russian watches by holding them in their hand,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it would be him that would restart them, other said he was sharpening their razors or something.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">All too weird for me, so I'd slowly climb my way up that enormous hill to my Rain Makers</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and stare at the world from up there.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I came up with the name Rain Makers,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they looked like they were scratching clouds.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">One time I brought a slice of refrigerated home made up there pizza up there,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">my mom made it the day before, it had olives.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It was too cold to eat it right,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it was a shame to eat it cold like that.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So I started a proper little fire,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I always had matches with me.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And I somewhat-believe it was me who invented a sure way to start a fire,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you had to start with twigs that were just about the size of the match.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And then sprinkle in larger, and larger, and larger bits,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">until the fire was cheerfully crackling.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I sharpened a stick that stabilized the slice,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and started heating it up.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Just the moment I did that,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">rain came, the ground was already somewhat muddy - it was a rainy day.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I looked around and figured I should build a shelter,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">to keep myself dry.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I easily moved a load of mud above a thick root,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and scooped a place for myself to perch in.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Few more sticks, and some downed branches with leaves on them,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and I had a waterproof stealth shelter worthy of a big fat rabbit.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I hunkered down into the hole,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and ate my slice of pizza that went from tasting odd due to being cold...</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To now tasting and smelling weird,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">as I was using leaves to keep the fire going.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I had no idea it would make my slice smell and somewhat even taste odd,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but I enjoyed it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The rain stopped,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and so so I slowly started making my way back down to the village.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Always somewhat worried if any geese want to hiss at me again,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and if perhaps I could find something interesting in the endless boxes at the garage.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The geese were a huge problem for me,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">to make things worse they would always hang out right in the spot that I needed to cross to get back.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Every adventure, as you can imagine, and even if you can't,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">always, always without a fail, has some fantastic cherry on top.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Once I begun running away from hunters,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that were walking my way, and before I knew it...</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I guess I tricked myself into thinking they were following me,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but get this, there needed up being a small fire, right where they disappeared into the woods.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I was watching them from the safety of my village home,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">through my high powered monoculars.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">My grandpa asked if I knew anything about the fire,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">yup, I snapped back, and reported that the hunters did it, no question about it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">They probably threw a cigarette on the ground,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the leaves caught fire.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Another time, I kid you not,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I ended up resting a bit, beneath an ice sheet!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The small river was high when the top froze,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but when I got there the river was down to a trickle</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And it had a proper and sturdy,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">roof of ice over it, it was magical!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">One time,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I was warned to stop expeditioning up to my trees.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Because the wheat filed workers that ran combines up there,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">found some creepy Chupacabra Gollum type creature.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I quickly put my detective hat on,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">sharpened some mean sticks for protection, and mounted an urgent expedition to find more evidence of the creature.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">On my way up there I encountered one of the villagers,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and he had some more info on what has now become a village legend, creepy talk of the town really.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Apparently they discovered the place where the was hiding,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and watching the village from.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">They assumed it was some genetic anomaly,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because it lived in the cold ground by one of the trees up there, and it wasn't man

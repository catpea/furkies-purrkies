  <p>3D models for printing on 3D printers,<br>sell for about $3 dollars.</p>
  <p>With the a neat looking <a href="https://pinshape.com/items/13088-3d-printed-cat-armor">Cat Armor</a> on Pinshape,<br>which is priced at $12.</p>
  <p>I think what makes a good 3D model, printed or not,<br>is a beautiful and unique design.</p>
  <p>And that it does not exist in stores,<br>due to its uniqueness - and even if it did, it would be too expensive.</p>

  <p>A person that buys a 3D printer for just about $200,<br>can print out an infinite number of knickknacks and curiosities.</p>
  <p>The stores I see online are not quite there yet,<br>people don't seem to advertise 3D models as proper products with a standalone website.</p>
  <p>To get a good idea what 3D products look like,<br>vist <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com">Thingverse</a>, <a href="https://cults3d.com/">Cults3D</a>, [Youmagine][], and <a href="https://pinshape.com">Pinshape</a>.</p>

  <p>Now from a more personal perspective,<br>I recently started learning Blender, a 3D modeling program.</p>
  <p>YouTube is full of Blender tutorials,<br>I was pretty fun to learn the basics.</p>
  <p>Blender is shipped with a 3D Print plugin that will evaluate geometry of a product,<br>and that truly lowers the on ramp, as one can click Check All, to catch problems at every operation.</p>
  <p>Blender allows for operations that 3D printers are not always happy about,<br>the 3D Print plugin is a very pleasant way to learn what one can and cannot do.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5Swx7vTkWpk">I have created a strange wallet</a> as part of my self education,<br>And made a series of interesting discoveries.</p>

  <p>The filament that printers use as "ink" costs $30 dollars for a roll,<br>and lasts for a couple of months - it is best to start with the most popular white filament as white easily hides imperfections.</p>
  <p>A print such as my strange wallet,<br>would take about 4 or 5 hours to print.</p>
  <p>Before a 3D Model (often an stl file) can be printed,<br>it must be sliced by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btLCKun-xFQ">Slicer</a>, the .stl file is converted to a .gcode file that printers understand.</p>

  <p>You can't give something legs unless you want to print supports,<br>for example when building a simple wallet, one side should be flat.</p>
  <p>You can't put a latch on the bottom, as the printers don't like complex shapes on the bottom.<br>though when slicing a model, one has an option to generate supports - awesome for fancy complex sculptures - but not so good for flat wallets.</p>
  <p>Best product designs are simple, or at least come in multiple parts that are simple,<br>if you wan to have a lion head on your wallet, you should print that as a separate piece.</p>
  <p>This way the back of the lion is flat, the back of the wallet is flat,<br>and you just need some superglue.</p>

  <p>The reason I designed my wallet as a case with hinges,<br>is because my next lesson is in designing a tiny computer case for the little Raspberry PI.</p>
  <p>There is one big change I will make,<br>and that is to round all the edges, as they come out sharp - it is fantastic how tough that plastic is.</p>
  <p>I made most of my wallet designs two millimeters thin,<br>to print them out very quickly, some of my designs took only an hour to print.</p>
  <p>This latest design, has 3 milometer side walls on the main case,<br>it is perfectly tough - all the final designs that require toughness should have 3mm sidewalls.</p>
  <p>A portable little computer case is a perfect 3mm sidewall candidate,<br>the case will not bend.</p>

  <p>3D Prints can have some minor warping,<br>and while temperature control can fix that, it is a good idea to plan for it.</p>
  <p>The earlier design had a top without any side walls,<br>plus I was testing experimental hinges which multiplied misalignment.</p>
  <p>This new top design, has overhanging edges,<br>and if there is any warping to the plastic, the top will still align perfectly, and the minor warping will actually contribute to keep the wallet closed.</p>

  <p>Modeling for a 3D printer,<br>is proper Industrial Design, whether an experienced designer of hobbyist, it is the same kind of fun.</p>
  <p>My earlier design though sturdy enough,<br>had a card sized hole when improperly closed.</p>
  <p>I didn't have a side wall up-front to easily slide cards out, when open,<br>but that also meant it had a credit card sized hole for the credit card to fall out if improperly closed.</p>
  <p>My latest design has only has a hole for thumb and index finger on each side,<br>I restored the front wall that would allow cards to fall out.</p>
  <p>It only took a few moments, but it was a wonderful feeling,<br>expanding my own creation, to account for new features and concerns.</p>

  <p>Making my little wallet-case taught me absolutely everything I need to know,<br>to make my little computer case.</p>
  <p>More than that, I think I will be one of very few people,<br>who will build a Raspberry Pi case with with hinges where one can open it for easy access to the GPIO connectors, or even the SDcard.</p>
  <p>My hinged Raspberry PI case with proper manifold geometry,<br>will be my first - dollar or two - product that I will sell in an online digital goods store.</p>
  <p>I plan on having multiple case variations,<br>something that would be cumbersome for a 3D printed product as one would be printing parts that the customer would not have use for.</p>
  <p>As a digital product, I can include cases that support batteries or various sizes,<br>or allow for securely mounting the case on top of a large power-bank.</p>
  <p>I can even cover multiple recent variations of the Raspberry Pi models,<br>while featuring universal addons that snap onto all the different cases.</p>
  <p>One can easily imagine how someone would prefer to buy a kit and a printer,<br>rather than continue buying new cases as they expand their inexpensive Pi collection.</p>
  <p>One of the cases I hope to design is a Raspberry Pi Camera Case,<br>which is less of a case and more of a camera, really.</p>
  <p>Finally, I would like to add that selling digital models,<br>does not mean that customers must own a 3D printer, as they can choose to have their digital models printed during checkout.</p>
  <p>I will explore that configuration,<br>when I begin designing small sculptures and jewelry pieces.</p>
  <p>The world sure has changed a little bit, video tutorials hold knowledge that previously required tutoring,<br>and one can easily buy a printer that can slowly extrude the entire contents of a dollar store - wow.</p>

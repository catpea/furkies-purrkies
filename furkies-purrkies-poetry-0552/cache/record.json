  "text": "3D models for printing on 3D printers,\nsell for about $3 dollars.\nWith the a neat looking Cat Armor[1] on Pinshape,\nwhich is priced at $12.\nI think what makes a good 3D model, printed or not,\nis a beautiful and unique design.\nAnd that it does not exist in stores,\ndue to its uniqueness - and even if it did, it would be too expensive.\n\nA person that buys a 3D printer for just about $200,\ncan print out an infinite number of knickknacks and curiosities.\nThe stores I see online are not quite there yet,\npeople don't seem to advertise 3D models as proper products with a standalone website.\nTo get a good idea what 3D products look like,\nvist Thingverse[2], Cults3D[3], [Youmagine][], and Pinshape[4].\n\nNow from a more personal perspective,\nI recently started learning Blender, a 3D modeling program.\nYouTube is full of Blender tutorials,\nI was pretty fun to learn the basics.\nBlender is shipped with a 3D Print plugin that will evaluate geometry of a product,\nand that truly lowers the on ramp, as one can click Check All, to catch problems at every operation.\nBlender allows for operations that 3D printers are not always happy about,\nthe 3D Print plugin is a very pleasant way to learn what one can and cannot do.\n\nI have created a strange wallet[5] as part of my self education,\nAnd made a series of interesting discoveries.\n\nThe filament that printers use as \"ink\" costs $30 dollars for a roll,\nand lasts for a couple of months - it is best to start with the most popular white filament as white easily hides imperfections.\nA print such as my strange wallet,\nwould take about 4 or 5 hours to print.\nBefore a 3D Model (often an stl file) can be printed,\nit must be sliced by a Slicer[6], the .stl file is converted to a .gcode file that printers understand.\n\nYou can't give something legs unless you want to print supports,\nfor example when building a simple wallet, one side should be flat.\nYou can't put a latch on the bottom, as the printers don't like complex shapes on the bottom.\nthough when slicing a model, one has an option to generate supports - awesome for fancy complex sculptures - but not so good for flat wallets.\nBest product designs are simple, or at least come in multiple parts that are simple,\nif you wan to have a lion head on your wallet, you should print that as a separate piece.\nThis way the back of the lion is flat, the back of the wallet is flat,\nand you just need some superglue.\n\nThe reason I designed my wallet as a case with hinges,\nis because my next lesson is in designing a tiny computer case for the little Raspberry PI.\nThere is one big change I will make,\nand that is to round all the edges, as they come out sharp - it is fantastic how tough that plastic is.\nI made most of my wallet designs two millimeters thin,\nto print them out very quickly, some of my designs took only an hour to print.\nThis latest design, has 3 milometer side walls on the main case,\nit is perfectly tough - all the final designs that require toughness should have 3mm sidewalls.\nA portable little computer case is a perfect 3mm sidewall candidate,\nthe case will not bend.\n\n3D Prints can have some minor warping,\nand while temperature control can fix that, it is a good idea to plan for it.\nThe earlier design had a top without any side walls,\nplus I was testing experimental hinges which multiplied misalignment.\nThis new top design, has overhanging edges,\nand if there is any warping to the plastic, the top will still align perfectly, and the minor warping will actually contribute to keep the wallet closed.\n\nModeling for a 3D printer,\nis proper Industrial Design, whether an experienced designer of hobbyist, it is the same kind of fun.\nMy earlier design though sturdy enough,\nhad a card sized hole when improperly closed.\nI didn't have a side wall up-front to easily slide cards out, when open,\nbut that also meant it had a credit card sized hole for the credit card to fall out if improperly closed.\nMy latest design has only has a hole for thumb and index finger on each side,\nI restored the front wall that would allow cards to fall out.\nIt only took a few moments, but it was a wonderful feeling,\nexpanding my own creation, to account for new features and concerns.\n\nMaking my little wallet-case taught me absolutely everything I need to know,\nto make my little computer case.\nMore than that, I think I will be one of very few people,\nwho will build a Raspberry Pi case with with hinges where one can open it for easy access to the GPIO connectors, or even the SDcard.\nMy hinged Raspberry PI case with proper manifold geometry,\nwill be my first - dollar or two - product that I will sell in an online digital goods store.\nI plan on having multiple case variations,\nsomething that would be cumbersome for a 3D printed product as one would be printing parts that the customer would not have use for.\nAs a digital product, I can include cases that support batteries or various sizes,\nor allow for securely mounting the case on top of a large power-bank.\nI can even cover multiple recent variations of the Raspberry Pi models,\nwhile featuring universal addons that snap onto all the different cases.\nOne can easily imagine how someone would prefer to buy a kit and a printer,\nrather than continue buying new cases as they expand their inexpensive Pi collection.\nOne of the cases I hope to design is a Raspberry Pi Camera Case,\nwhich is less of a case and more of a camera, really.\nFinally, I would like to add that selling digital models,\ndoes not mean that customers must own a 3D printer, as they can choose to have their digital models printed during checkout.\nI will explore that configuration,\nwhen I begin designing small sculptures and jewelry pieces.\nThe world sure has changed a little bit, video tutorials hold knowledge that previously required tutoring,\nand one can easily buy a printer that can slowly extrude the entire contents of a dollar store - wow.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://pinshape.com/items/13088-3d-printed-cat-armor\n[2]: https://www.thingiverse.com\n[3]: https://cults3d.com/\n[4]: https://pinshape.com\n[5]: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5Swx7vTkWpk\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btLCKun-xFQ",

  <div class="paragraph">You didn't want to come out at first,<br>as I had crooked hands that were cursed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I painted and painted and got nothing in return,<br>being on a timer I felt concern.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I sat there thinking about you,<br>until I became blue.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">It is just the magic of wings,<br>it is just one of those things.</div>

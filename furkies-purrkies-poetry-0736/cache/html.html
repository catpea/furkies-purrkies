  <p>You didn't want to come out right at first,<br>as if I had crooked hands that were also cursed.</p>
  <p>Everything I did looked flat,<br>like someone took a shoe, and splat!</p>
  <p>I sat there thinking about you,<br>until I myself, became blue.</p>
  <p>But as I finally painted you on my eighteenth try,<br>you became my favorite butterfly.</p>

  <p>You did show me the way,<br>and it was right in front of me all day.</p>
  <p>To put it simply, The wing that stands taller,<br>must be of different color.</p>
  <p>But this is not just about shadows,<br>and not even the pose.</p>
  <p>It is the magic of wings,<br>it is just one of those things.</p>
  <p>There is a lot of magic in art,<br>it is how you tell art from reality apart.</p>
  <p>Art helps us create worlds that cannot be,<br>art, sets our imagination, truly free.</p>

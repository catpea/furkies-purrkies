  <p>Oh my lovely butterfly,<br>I painted you on my eighteenth try.</p>
  <p>You didn't want to come out at first,<br>as I had crooked hands that were cursed.</p>
  <p>I painted and painted and got nothing in return,<br>being on a timer I felt concern.</p>
  <p>Everything I did looked flat,<br>like someone took a shoe and splat!</p>
  <p>I sat there thinking about you,<br>until I became blue.</p>

  <p>Alas, you showed me the way,<br>and it was right in front of my face all day.</p>
  <p>The wing that stands taller,<br>must be of different color.</p>
  <p>But this is not just about shadows,<br>and not even the pose.</p>
  <p>It is just the magic of wings,<br>it is just one of those things.</p>

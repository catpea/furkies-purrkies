Oh my lovely butterfly,
I painted you on my eighteenth try.
You didn't want to come out at first,
as I had crooked hands that were cursed.
I painted and painted and got nothing in return,
being on a timer I felt concern.
Everything I did looked flat,
like someone took a shoe and splat!
I sat there thinking about you,
until I became blue.

Oh my butterfly,
why?

Alas, you showed me the way,
and it was right in front of my face all day.
The wing that stands taller,
must be of different color.
But this is not just about shadows,
and not even the pose.
It is just the magic of wings,
it is just one of those things.

Oh sure you look a little retarded,
but you are how my hand drawn art started.

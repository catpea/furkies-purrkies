  "text": "Time for all of us to rise,\nto fuel that which is greatest within us.\nIt is how we change the world with our works,\nthat matters the most in the end.\nIt is almost certainly a very small book,\none that will sit along side a smartphone.\nAnd it is a book of answers,\nthat helps the children to real life.\nLet us open our books\nby undoing burdens:\n\"Whatever trouble brought you to my book, child,\nknow that there are few people\nthat would have acted differently\nin circumstances similar to yours.\"\nAnd then carefully, let us share,\nin the limited number of pages that we have,\nwhat has moved us the most.\nWithout our hard earned wisdom,\nthey don't really have a chance at not making the same mistakes.\nWho else is going to teach them if not us,\nwhat Socrates said was only meant for the age he grew up in.\nWe need to repeat it anew,\nnearer the culture of the children.\nWe have to help them understand,\nthat old age is a privileged denied to many.\nSo as long as we take to living in pursuit if wisdom,\nand it is never to late to start, aging is a good thing.\nLet us not have the children start at the same height we stated,\nlet us spare them the aches we went through, may our aches count for more.\nLet us show the younger generations that we are rising,\nthat we are building a better world albeit slowly.\nThe world can't be replaced,\nit must be transformed.\nJust like a ship can't be replaced,\nbut can be transformed by updating it, board by board.\nLet us show them that part of the meaning of their existence,\nis a lasting legacy of wisdom.\nThe sooner they start,\nthe more beautiful their rise.\nAnd the other part is Happiness,\nout of Wisdom, out of Strength.\nThe meaning of life comes with Wisdom,\nas our mind becomes more powerful for all the good ideas it gathers.\nWe have to help the children to understand,\nthat they belong to a Universal Culture, that they are Citizens of the World.\nThat all the things that change based on geographic location,\nare but traditions.\nOnly that which remains regardless of where they are born,\nis their true culture.\nWe have to get them to help each other as they grow,\nto reach out to each other across borders.\nThe borders that dive us,\nborders are just the products of small and primitive minds.\nThe future belongs to the children,\nnot those who gained authority by pretending.\nThere is hope for a more just and transparent world,\nbut it requires that we all stand in relentless pursuit of wisdom.\nA liar will always win,\nexcept when it comes to the wise\nThe wise will easily recognize the uneducated fool,\ntaking on his pleasing shapes.\nLet us help the younger generations, to wisdom,\nby telling them about Philosophers and their Love and Pursuit of Wisdom.\nLet us pass on only the good ideas,\nand commit the bad ones to history books as cautionary tales.\nA life is a work of art, it paints it self day by day,\nto create a beautiful picture, our legacy.\nLife is best lived when what we learned yesterday,\nadds to help us become a little bit wiser today.\nThe energy and the force for it all comes from\nfrom watching our contributions help the world grow.\nThe new generations starting, not at zero,\nbut at the heights that we bought them to, by our own deliberate pursuit of wisdom.",

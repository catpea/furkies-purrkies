  <p>What comes next may sting a little,<br>as it may include an attack from other artists.</p>
  <p>Practicing on photos, is only as step away from using GIMP's Warp Transform,<br>to beautify your source photos, photos that you MUST now take yourself.</p>
  <p>As using that as foundation,<br>for impossibly beautiful paintings that bring joy to the heart.</p>
  <p>You are about to enter the viral zone,<br>where you are going to cut into other peoples' profits and subscribers.</p>
  <p>They did this to themselves,<br>they have kept the world of digital painting artificially small, by means of hate and shame.</p>

  <p>Not everyone is always attacked,<br>but a lot of people are already held back by dumb ideas learned in broken schools.</p>
  <p>They mistakenly believe their methods are less valid,<br>because they are not medieval, or uselessly difficult, or slightly misshapen.</p>
  <p>Doubting ones art or talent, is an attack,<br>eventually it may combine to uninspire an artist from creating anymore of their own works.</p>
  <p>Uninspired artist become carriers of this blight,<br>and tend to uninspired others.</p>

  <p>Your use of photographs,<br>will be the first thing they will attack.</p>
  <p>Then people will come and say,<br>"professionals will get fired if they don't use photographs and just sit there copying with a stupid grid."</p>
  <p>Then they will say,<br>"How did you get here?", "You are new how can you be this good?".</p>
  <p>They will create a fantasy test,<br>where others pass and you fail, it will make no sense, at all, it will be like reasoning with a cult.</p>
  <p>They will call you best work fake,<br>because digital paining does not look like that.</p>
  <p>And a lot of people will unsubscribe,<br>go somewhere else and in uppercase they will say "Once I heard, I unsubscribed."</p>
  <p>And they will have heard some half-asses argument,<br>that by laws of physics, can't make sense, but they will stick to it for points.</p>
  <p>They will steal your art,<br>and make animations that quote PROVE unquote how you are FAKE, FAKE, FAKE.</p>
  <p>And then, the person into whose profits you are cutting into the most,<br>will challenge you to a contest, designed to bring them extra subscribers.</p>
  <p>Draw freehand, they will say, and the impartial judge,<br>will pick a model that the liar practiced on for weeks.</p>
  <p>If the story ever comes out, they will blame you for trying to discredit validity the contest,<br>and call you a sour loser.</p>

  <p>Don't tell me this is not hate,<br>and know: that liars always win.</p>
  <p>Because they get you to play,<br>by their own rules.</p>
  <p>The only way to win, or more precisely to get out of there,<br>is to step around them, and keep on learning.</p>

  <p>Art, is not an echo chamber, it is a living berating forest.<br>only social media is.</p>
  <p>Art is an infinite verse,<br>it is not just a multi verse Tesseract, because you can climb outside it.</p>
  <p>And for example pain what the liar looks like,<br>or how the industry crushes artists, or how every liar is a sellout first.</p>
  <p>The liar will always keep to the tiny area they command, think about it this way,<br>they peak in High School, and they stay a teenager so long they they become super creepy.</p>
  <p>Though you can't win against a liar,<br>you can step outside of their world.</p>

  <p>They lose all power over you,<br>the moment you stop trying to belong to their circle.</p>
  <p>They will still be stanching subscribers by calling you FAKE,<br>the day you exhibit at Museum of Modern Art...</p>
  <p>Or Guggenheim, or Centre Pompidou, or,<br>the Musée d’Art DAR Moderne de la Ville de Paris.</p>
  <p>Lying is their art,<br>and they don't perceive things like hate.</p>

  <p>I repeat, just lift your foot a bit higher,<br>and step over them, they are tiny little thing after all.</p>

  <p>The only problem is being unprepared for the attack,<br>and most people are.</p>
  <p>The attack starts really early, chances are they already got you, with the words,<br>"Don't copy", "Tracing is not art", "That's just a paint-over", "Oh you're color picking???", "Oh that is so lame.".</p>
  <p>That is the precursor to calling you a fake,<br>more than that.</p>
  <p>Brilliant and unsuspecting people fake their tutorials because of this sickness,<br>when they are inevitably caught by one of the lairs looking at frames in slow motion, their career ends, at least under their own name.</p>

  <p>You have to be strong,<br>you aren't copying, you are reinventing like a god with your own hands.</p>
  <p>you aren't tracing you are comprehending,<br>you are training your brain, your eyes, your touch, even your spirit.</p>
  <p>It is not a paint-over, you are improving nature, you are conducting a scared symphony,<br>restoring the person's youth to last forever, you are bringing back their teenage days, right into their eyes; you are restoring their strength.</p>
  <p>You are not color picking, you are bonding your work with the universe,<br>you are entering into harmony with reality.</p>
  <p>You are not fake, you are not lame,<br>you were born a creator, into a world trembling from its inhabitants fighting for the insignificant, the bottom most step.</p>

  <p>And you are not just learning art,<br>or how to become an artist.</p>
  <p>You don't need those labels,<br>you need to rise.</p>

  <p>Rise,<br>so that Humanity can rise with you.</p>
  <p>So that the future has Peace, and Real Justice, and Authenticity and Dignity,<br>as it stops repeating the simplest mistakes and finally begins moving forward at a pace that is worthy of us all.</p>

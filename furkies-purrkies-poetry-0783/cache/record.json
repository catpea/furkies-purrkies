photos, photos that you MUST now take yourself.\nAs using that as foundation,\nfor impossibly beautiful paintings that bring joy to the heart.\nYou are about to enter the viral zone,\nwhere you are going to cut into other peoples' profits and subscribers.\nThey did this to themselves,\nthey have kept the world of digital painting artificially small, by means of hate and shame.\n\nNot everyone is always attacked,\nbut a lot of people are already held back by dumb ideas learned in broken schools.\nThey mistakenly believe their methods are less valid,\nbecause they are not medieval, or uselessly difficult, or slightly misshapen.\nDoubting ones art or talent, is an attack,\neventually it may combine to uninspire an artist from creating anymore of their own works.\nUninspired artist become carriers of this blight,\nand tend to uninspired others.\n\nYour use of photographs,\nwill be the first thing they will attack.\nThen people will come and say,\n\"professionals will get fired if they don't use photographs and just sit there copying with a stupid grid.\"\nThen they will say,\n\"How did you get here?\", \"You are new how can you be this good?\".\nThey will create a fantasy test,\nwhere others pass and you fail, it will make no sense, at all, it will be like reasoning with a cult.\nThey will call you best work fake,\nbecause digital paining does not look like that.\nAnd a lot of people will unsubscribe,\ngo somewhere else and in uppercase they will say \"Once I heard, I unsubscribed.\"\nAnd they will have heard some half-asses argument,\nthat by laws of physics, can't make sense, but they will stick to it for points.\nThey will steal your art,\nand make animations that quote PROVE unquote how you are FAKE, FAKE, FAKE.\nAnd then, the person into whose profits you are cutting into the most,\nwill challenge you to a contest, designed to bring them extra subscribers.\nDraw freehand, they will say, and the impartial judge,\nwill pick a model that the liar practiced on for weeks.\nIf the story ever comes out, they will blame you for trying to discredit validity the contest,\nand call you a sour loser.\n\nDon't tell me this is not hate,\nand know: that liars always win.\nBecause they get you to play,\nby their own rules.\nThe only way to win, or more precisely to get out of there,\nis to step around them, and keep on learning.\n\nArt, is not an echo chamber, it is a living berating forest.\nonly social media is.\nArt is an infinite verse,\nit is not just a multi verse Tesseract, because you can climb outside it.\nAnd for example pain what the liar looks like,\nor how the industry crushes artists, or how every liar is a sellout first.\nThe liar will always keep to the tiny area they command, think about it this way,\nthey peak in High School, and they stay a teenager so long they they become super creepy.\nThough you can't win against a liar,\nyou can step outside of their world.\n\nPlease do not play by their rules,\nas their rules are crafted to crush your spirit, and keep you down.\nThey lose all power over you,\nthe moment you stop trying to belong to their circle.\nThey will still be stanching subscribers by calling you FAKE,\nthe day you exhibit at Museum of Modern Art...\nOr Guggenheim, or Centre Pompidou, or,\nthe Musée d’Art DAR Moderne de la Ville de Paris.\nLying is their art,\nand they don't perceive things like hate.\nUntil they self destruct,\nthey only want, MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE.\n\nThe world of art is a beautiful and free world,\nand so is the world of Politics, and Pursuit of Knowledge.\nBut liars are so effective at what they do,\nthat they clog the first step.\nAnd in their madness and mediocrity call it the greatest height,\nanyone has ever reached.\nI repeat, just lift your foot a bit higher,\nand step over them, they are tiny little thing after all.\n\nThe only problem is being unprepared for the attack,\nand most people are.\nThe attack starts really early, chances are they already got you, with the words,\n\"Don't copy\", \"Tracing is not art\", \"That's just a paint-over\", \"Oh you're color picking???\", \"Oh that is so lame.\".\nThat is the precursor to calling you a fake,\nmore than that.\nBrilliant and unsuspecting people fake their tutorials because of this sickness,\nwhen they are inevitably caught by one of the lairs looking at frames in slow motion, their career ends, at least under their own name.\n\nYou have to be strong,\nyou aren't copying, you are reinventing like a god with your own hands.\nyou aren't tracing you are comprehending,\nyou are training your brain, your eyes, your touch, even your spirit.\nIt is not a paint-over, you are improving nature, you are conducting a scared symphony,\nrestoring the person's youth to last forever, you are bringing back their teenage days, right into their eyes; you are restoring their strength.\nYou are not color picking, you are bonding your work with the universe,\nyou are entering into harmony with reality.\nYou are not fake, you are not lame,\nyou were born a creator, into a world trembling from its inhabitants fighting for the insignificant, the bottom most step.\n\nAnd you are not just learning art,\nor how to become an artist.\nYou don't need those labels,\nyou need to rise.\nBy the noblest means,\nand by subtle analogy.\nRise,\nso that Humanity can rise with you.\nSo that the future has Peace, and Real Justice, and Authenticity and Dignity,\nas it stops repeating the simplest mistakes and finally begins moving forward at a pace that is worthy of us all.",

What comes next may sting a little,
as it may include an attack from other artists.

Practicing on photos, is only as step away from using GIMP's Warp Transform,
to beautify your source photos, photos that you MUST now take yourself.

As using that as foundation,
for impossibly beautiful paintings that bring joy to the heart.

You are about to enter the viral zone,
where you are going to cut into other peoples' profits and subscribers.

They did this to themselves,
they have kept the world of digital painting artificially small, by means of hate and shame.

---

Not everyone is always attacked,
but a lot of people are already held back by dumb ideas learned in broken schools.

They mistakenly believe their methods are less valid,
because they are not medieval, or uselessly difficult, or slightly misshapen.

Doubting ones art or talent, is an attack,
eventually it may combine to uninspire an artist from creating anymore of their own works.

Uninspired artist become carriers of this blight,
and tend to uninspired others.

---

Your use of photographs,
will be the first thing they will attack.

Then people will come and say,
"professionals will get fired if they don't use photographs and just sit there copying with a stupid grid."

Then they will say,
"How did you get here?", "You are new how can you be this good?".

They will create a fantasy test,
where others pass and you fail, it will make no sense, at all, it will be like reasoning with a cult.

They will call you best work fake,
because digital paining does not look like that.

And a lot of people will unsubscribe,
go somewhere else and in uppercase they will say "Once I heard, I unsubscribed."

And they will have heard some half-asses argument,
that by laws of physics, can't make sense, but they will stick to it for points.

They will steal your art,
and make animations that quote PROVE unquote how you are FAKE, FAKE, FAKE.

And then, the person into whose profits you are cutting into the most,
will challenge you to a contest, designed to bring them extra subscribers.

Draw freehand, they will say, and the impartial judge,
will pick a model that the liar practiced on for weeks.

If the story ever comes out, they will blame you for trying to discredit validity the contest,
and call you a sour loser.

---

Don't tell me this is not hate,
and know: that liars always win.

Because they get you to play,
by their own rules.

The only way to win, or more precisely to get out of there,
is to step around them, and keep on learning.

---

Art, is not an echo chamber, it is a living berating forest.
only social media is.

Art is an infinite verse,
it is not just a multi verse Tesseract, because you can climb outside it.

And for example pain what the liar looks like,
or how the industry crushes artists, or how every liar is a sellout first.

The liar will always keep to the tiny area they command, think about it this way,
they peak in High School, and they stay a teenager so long they they become super creepy.

Though you can't win against a liar,
you can step outside of their world.

---

Please do not play by their rules,
as their rules are crafted to crush your spirit, and keep you down.

They lose all power over you,
the moment you stop trying to belong to their circle.

They will still be stanching subscribers by calling you FAKE,
the day you exhibit at Museum of Modern Art...

Or Guggenheim, or Centre Pompidou, or,
the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.

Lying is their art,
and they don't perceive things like hate.

Until they self destruct,
they only want, MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE.

---

The world of art is a beautiful and free world,
and so is the world of Politics, and Pursuit of Knowledge.

But liars are so effective at what they do,
that they clog the first step.

And in their madness and mediocrity call it the greatest height,
anyone has ever reached.

I repeat, just lift your foot a bit higher,
and step over them, they are tiny little thing after all.

---

The only problem is being unprepared for the attack,
and most people are.

The attack starts really early, chances are they already got you, with the words,
"Don't copy", "Tracing is not art", "That's just a paint-over", "Oh you're color picking???", "Oh that is so lame.".

That is the precursor to calling you a fake,
more than that.

Brilliant and unsuspecting people fake their tutorials because of this sickness,
when they are inevitably caught by one of the lairs looking at frames in slow motion, their career ends, at least under their own name.

---

You have to be strong,
you aren't copying, you are reinventing like a god with your own hands.

you aren't tracing you are comprehending,
you are training your brain, your eyes, your touch, even your spirit.

It is not a paint-over, you are improving nature, you are conducting a scared symphony,
restoring the person's youth to last forever, you are bringing back their teenage days, right into their eyes; you are restoring their strength.

You are not color picking, you are bonding your work with the universe,
you are entering into harmony with reality.

You are not fake, you are not lame,
you were born a creator, into a world trembling from its inhabitants fighting for the insignificant, the bottom most step.

---

And you are not just learning art,
or how to become an artist.

You don't need those labels,
you need to rise.

By the noblest means,
and by subtle analogy.

Rise,
so that Humanity can rise with you.

So that the future has Peace, and Real Justice, and Authenticity and Dignity,
as it stops repeating the simplest mistakes and finally begins moving forward at a pace that is worthy of us all.

<p>People can vote in elections, and there is no real threat of corruption here,</p>\n  <p>because their voting history is under their profile.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Elections, that was one of the things that got a huge upgrade in many of the cities around the world,</p>\n  <p>some cities just vote on ideas that need to get done, they don&apos;t vote on representatives anymore.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The program as a whole,</p>\n  <p>eliminated the need for representatives.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People vote on issues that

within the program,</p>\n  <p>schools begun working for the students by providing them with Audio Books, Lectures, and Chat (that&apos;s what the teachers are called),</p>\n  <p>and the trail of programs that students select over the course of their teenage years actually becomes their resume.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Schools started working,</p>\n  <p>it was Rebirth and Enlightenment of both the citizens and the cities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The second,</p>\n  <p>people could work on tasks logged by the users of the program.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Some tasks like taking care of public gardens could result in users getting monthly tips from their community,</p>\n  <p>people loved being able to give the lady down the street $8/mo. for making sure all the flower beds were taken care of,</p>\n  <p>the lady next door was often bringing in $3,200 per month for something that she would do anyway, people loved her.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Other tasks like road work, could get a bounty, bounties basically ensured that all the road work was done,</p>\n  <p>any competent company could claim a task and grab the bounty for a pothole.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People would setup an tiny Limited Liability Company and stock up on compatible materials, and wait for roadwork tasks,</p>\n  <p>there were no more delays to get things done, and these bounties could grow fast.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All this was tested in the games before cities adopted the program,</p>\n  <p>so everyone knew what they were getting, and the stuff just worked.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There was an interesting phenomenon where automated programs would actually stay in place of people,</p>\n  <p>one of the most well know instances dealt with the prison population, in a small Swiss city.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The entire process was often ran by bots,</p>\n  <p>city was able to vote on presets, this eliminated the need for many local Judges.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In this particular instance all the folks who got into fights,</p>\n  <p>were automatically given community service, duration of which would increase with each repeated offense under the same category,</p>\n  <p>the community service program was actually a well paying program, the users didn&apos;t want people to go to jail,</p>\n  <p>they wanted the troublemakers to get a job.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Words like felon and criminal were not used, people in the community had access to their entire education,</p>\n  <p>they could see into hearts and souls of these users, the books, pursuits, and curiosities of their teenage years were right there.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Psychologists were able to build up a new spectrum disorder, that emerged from stress, loss, fear, isolation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Swiss town actually ended up closing most of it&apos;s prisons.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In America, a similar system of automated programs resulted in a lot of convictions being overturned.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>\n    This was a prison management system where the inmates were able to present their case in a way that the citizens would understand from a more humane perspective,</p>\n  again the entire past of that person was right there, tragedies and loss, and stress would be followed by more misfortune, deteriorating mental condition, desperate self medication\n  to get back to a thinking state, and what was once called a Felon or Criminal, once again became a Human, a Brother, a Son, a Daughter, a Mother.<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Prison population dropped.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nobody called this program a game,</p>\n  <p>it was always meant to change the world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The cities were always connected together to form a larger Global Metropolis,</p>\n  <p>originally it helped people with jobs, as users could tell where they could find tasks that fit them best,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But now, decades after the initial release;</p>\n  <p>the program begun uniting the world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>War, for one became unthinkable,</p>\n  <p>as people could see how the well being of even one city affected all the others.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There was no such thing as not having a job,</p>\n  <p>the cities always needed help with countless tasks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Corruption had nowhere to hide, the crooked politicians had nowhere to hide,</p>\n  <p>national borders made little economic sense, and Climate Change stopped being an issue by 2030.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not that they cared for rewards, but The Women behind the program,</p>\n  <p>the original programmers, received Purple Hearts and multiple Nobel Peace Prizes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What they did love was the fact that the United Nations regained a certain vitality,</p>\n  <p>something that they discovered was once lost in the translation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Every city now has a sculpture to honor them.</p>\n  <p>Many of their sculptures bear the words they uttered so many times during the initial development, &quot;Faster Horses&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In closing, the conjecture was true.</p>\n  <p>In the haste of life, people, often out of desperation, will try to meet goals by exploiting systems without active countermeasures.</p>\n  <p>The only system that can resist corruption and exploitation, is one designed from ground up to resist it.</p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It takes a computer to create a a corruption-resistant scaffold around the matters of a city.</p>\n  <p>Where there is no room for stretching rules, the participants can only be encouraged to take the correct paths.</p>\n</div>",

  <p>Preface: All are welcome to this technique,<br>even those who angrily object to it.</p>
  <p>If you are one of those individuals, and don't like using reference tools,<br>start with a free hand sketch, and a color study.</p>
  <p>But please don't use the color theory, or grids,<br>or measure the size of one thing by the size of another.</p>
  <p>Because that is just this technique,<br>with extra steps.</p>
  <p>What is more, is that this technique is a superior teacher of shape and color,<br>it places mastery of painting in the hands of all the people of the world.</p>
  <p>Let the world learn,<br>and let it learn by subtle analogy to what it grasps.</p>
  <p>Do not stand in its way,<br>do not stand in the way of progress.</p>

  <p>Above all, this technique while being a way to create beautiful paintings,<br>is a teacher, this technique is the world's first free art class.</p>
  <p>The first lecture is to take a sunny selfie,<br>load it up in Image Reference Tool in Krita...</p>
  <p>Stretch the reference image over the full canvas,<br>and use the reference image as a source of shapes and colors.</p>

  <p>The cruel, the ones suffering the sunk cost fallacy,<br>and those who have used art to make themselves special and elevate themselves above others.</p>
  <p>Will attack back,<br>they will attack with problems in their own heads, with jealousy and hate.</p>
  <p>The disorder of indirectly tracing source image by means of grids,<br>while rejecting a direct trace with wall projectors or semi transparent reference images runs deep.</p>
  <p>People have been analyzing Vermeer paintings to see if he is a real master,<br>or if he used a projector, a Camera Obscura.</p>

  <p>He did, just not in the shallow way the haters,<br>want him to use it to discredit him, and burn his art.</p>
  <p>He used Camera Obscura to study light and color,<br>he used it to study shapes of the face as they are not as we want them to be.</p>
  <p>Later, people would learn by studying his paintings,<br>calling him a master.</p>

  <p>Don't let bullies get to you, this technique produces perfectly valid paintings,<br>but this pales in comparison to how quickly people master art by creating those works.</p>
  <p>We are talking a pandemonium level event here,<br>cats and dogs living together, art hysteria.</p>
  <p>Internet trolls going from Paint.exe,<br>to towering over Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo, and other creative turtles.</p>

  <p>Ladies and germs,<br>a great injustice has befallen the world.</p>
  <p>We have all become artists with the invention of digital painting,<br>but this has been kept from us by mediocrity, jealousy, hate, and the stupid notion of copying shapes indirectly by means of grids.</p>

  <p>Long ago, a bunch of morons destroyed art and artists by stamping it with a red DENIED stamp,<br>and denying access to the worlds most famous gallery.</p>
  <p>Artists who use heart and soul to create works,<br>were cut by disgusting little moderators, who are lite more than big fat white lice.</p>
  <p>Out of that darkness, that cult,<br>impressionism emerged.</p>
  <p>People rejected the mainstream,<br>and found a way around the mainstream.</p>

  <p>With the advent of Digital Painting, and even inexpensive Wall Projectors,<br>the world has become ready for a new revolution.</p>
  <p>A revolution that rejects indirect use of reference images,<br>and embraces them as the main source of shape and color.</p>

  <p>We have to remind the world,<br>that we are one, and equally intelligent, and that we are all to converge on peace and wisdom in the future.</p>
  <p>That the world of art has no room,<br>for belittling, or hate, or jealousy, or arrogance towards artists, or any being.</p>
  <p>And to capture perfect depictions of our loved ones,<br>in the way that we truly see them.</p>
  <p>And forever remind all, that we are all artists,<br>that we were all artists all along.</p>

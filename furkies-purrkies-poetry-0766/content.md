Preface: All are welcome to this technique,
even those who angrily object to it.

If you are one of those individuals, and don't like using reference tools,
start with a free hand sketch, and a color study.

But please don't use the color theory, or grids,
or measure the size of one thing by the size of another.

Because that is just this technique,
with extra steps.

What is more, is that this technique is a superior teacher of shape and color,
it places mastery of painting in the hands of all the people of the world.

Let the world learn,
and let it learn by subtle analogy to what it grasps.

Do not stand in its way,
do not stand in the way of progress.

---

Above all, this technique while being a way to create beautiful paintings,
is a teacher, this technique is the world's first free art class.

The first lecture is to take a sunny selfie,
load it up in Image Reference Tool in Krita...

Stretch the reference image over the full canvas,
and use the reference image as a source of shapes and colors.

---

The cruel, the ones suffering the sunk cost fallacy,
and those who have used art to make themselves special and elevate themselves above others.

Will attack back,
they will attack with problems in their own heads, with jealousy and hate.

The disorder of indirectly tracing source image by means of grids,
while rejecting a direct trace with wall projectors or semi transparent reference images runs deep.

People have been analyzing Vermeer paintings to see if he is a real master,
or if he used a projector, a Camera Obscura.

---

He did, just not in the shallow way the haters,
want him to use it to discredit him, and burn his art.

He used Camera Obscura to study light and color,
he used it to study shapes of the face as they are not as we want them to be.

Later, people would learn by studying his paintings,
calling him a master.

---

Don't let bullies get to you, this technique produces perfectly valid paintings,
but this pales in comparison to how quickly people master art by creating those works.

We are talking a pandemonium level event here,
cats and dogs living together, art hysteria.

Internet trolls going from Paint.exe,
to towering over Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo, and other creative turtles.


---

Ladies and germs,
a great injustice has befallen the world.

We have all become artists with the invention of digital painting,
but this has been kept from us by mediocrity, jealousy, hate, and the stupid notion of copying shapes indirectly by means of grids.

---

Long ago, a bunch of morons destroyed art and artists by stamping it with a red DENIED stamp,
and denying access to the worlds most famous gallery.

Artists who use heart and soul to create works,
were cut by disgusting little moderators, who are lite more than big fat white lice.

Out of that darkness, that cult,
impressionism emerged.

People rejected the mainstream,
and found a way around the mainstream.

---

With the advent of Digital Painting, and even inexpensive Wall Projectors,
the world has become ready for a new revolution.

A revolution that rejects indirect use of reference images,
and embraces them as the main source of shape and color.

---

We have to remind the world,
that we are one, and equally intelligent, and that we are all to converge on peace and wisdom in the future.

That the world of art has no room,
for belittling, or hate, or jealousy, or arrogance towards artists, or any being.

And to capture perfect depictions of our loved ones,
in the way that we truly see them.

And forever remind all, that we are all artists,
that we were all artists all along.

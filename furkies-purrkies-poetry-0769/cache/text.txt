You definitely don't want to stand for it,
cause this one takes a little bit.
If something goes wrong,
delete, try again, and stay strong.
Hair is not painted with a hair brush,
you actually use the air brush.
You don't need to get each and every hair,
as that is somewhat unfair.
You want to capture the structure and shine,
and put your barber hat on, to make it all align.
Not all techniques work for all kinds of hair,
painting hair is a unique affair.

Painting hair,
requires great care.
Though you can get away with a sketch,
it won't feel right by any stretch.
Because hair springs or flows,
and when you look at multiple photos, it really shows[1].
It is only the last touch,
where you gently add strands and such.
The structure above all,
or it will look like a flat wall.

Painting hair can be pretty scary,
and it get worst the more someone's hairy.
And since every one has their own style,
only seeing their own do will make them smile.

The more famous your portraits become,
the more your clients dress to look awesome.
It is very silly in a way,
as some do-s may make you want to run away.

But that is just the challenge of good art,
so stay strong and use your heart.

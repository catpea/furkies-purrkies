  <p>First of all let me just say,<br>that schools are for you, the teachers are meant to help you, and not punish or scare you.</p>
  <p>You are all the Hope and Dreams, and the future of this world,<br>your school does not belong to the principal, or the teachers, or even the state, or the wealthy.</p>
  <p>It is yours,<br>it is a gift from history's greatest philosophers.</p>
  <p>If you have a friend,<br>let them keep you company as you go to the principal's office and learn to stand up for justice.</p>
  <p>All the power that the principal is imbued with,<br>depends on the fact that you feel safe, that you are growing stronger, and that you are truly learning.</p>
  <p>Tell the principal that changes need to be made,<br>and that you demand an unconditional, and honest apology.</p>
  <p>Because it is not their paychecks,<br>but your education, that is the point of the school you are in.</p>
  <p>Tell them that next time, you won't be so easily pacified, and you will demand that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6uHUx728">lemon</a> is transferred early,<br>and each class begins showing real and practical results.</p>
  <p>When you are done making promises to the principal,<br>begin learning to talk to the news.</p>
  <p>Tell them that you think you are getting a fake education,<br>because nothing you are being taught shows any practical applications - and it does nothing to get you out of poverty.</p>
  <p>Go to the Radio, TV station, and the still reputable newspapers, talk with whoever is there about the school being fake,<br>and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jsUj4DqWfU">teachers doing as little as possible to just get paid</a>.</p>

  <p>I have a theory as to what maybe driving your teacher to anger, to being unfair,<br>or even to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">purposefully manipulating your grades</a>, and it maybe a combination of poverty and indoctrination.</p>
  <p>Even teachers that are very kind are blinded,<br>believing nonsense such as “we need grades to make the students work hard”.</p>
  <p>To fully answer your question,<br>you have to understand how teachers and adults, and even teenagers, can have their minds clouded to act against their own and Humanity’s best interests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Fundamentally, the teacher is confused because they lack answers,<br>they are scared, threatened by poverty, unable to get a good grasp on the meaning of education, and they have little grasp on the Human Condition.</p>
  <p>Understand that growing up has nothing to do with aging,<br>it has to do with Knowledge and Wisdom, and where and how they are moving in life.</p>
  <p>If all they are is older,<br>then your teachers are just aged and confused children who gave up on making sense of life.</p>

  <p>Be it by choice, or by being tricked, or by desperation, the teacher is there to make money,<br>by what many assume is education.</p>
  <p>But you are not getting an education,<br>your mind is being sold for years and years of paychecks.</p>
  <p>Real education brings real results,<br>like the time when you were learning to read, or learning numbers and basic math.</p>
  <p>This gave you the real ability,<br>to slowly read a book about philosophers.</p>
  <p>Or to use your knowledge of numbers to step into the world of computer programming,<br>where all the calculations are automatically solved for you, and you instead create endless nested formulas.</p>
  <p>Fake education, is that art class, that only made you hold color pencils,<br>and never taught you how to draw a realistic face, even though that is something that only requires a school or office projector to trace the outlines of a picture you took.</p>
  <p>A fake class does not leave you with something that is useful at the end,<br>it give you the promise that things will connect but they never do.</p>
  <p>More than mere promises, you are threatened with bad grades, repeating a class,<br>and then face the more long-term threats of bad GPA or not being able to get into college.</p>
  <p>You are not just facing fake and corrupt education,<br>you are being tricked to accept it.</p>
  <p>You may already be aware that you will be paying for college,<br>and you might have already accepted it.</p>
  <p>Paying for a fake education,<br>is even worse than getting one for free, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ve23i5K334">it is a sign of getting indoctrinated into a fantasy lifestyle</a>.</p>

  <p>Your parents are sending you to school,<br>because they are using school as a babysitter in hopes of controlling your behavior when they are not around.</p>
  <p>They don’t want you at home alone,<br>because you don’t have enough experience in life to make the correct choices.</p>
  <p>Usually when an adult is alone,<br>they take to self education, to a search for wisdom, or a search for adventure.</p>
</div>

  <p>Adults understand that wisdom will protect them from being taken advantage of,<br>young people out of lack of experience, often take the opposite path.</p>
  <p>The inexperienced will be enchanted by behaviors of movie characters, and celebrities,<br>by things like displays of anger, fist fighting, or drinking a beer.</p>
  <p>Adults see this kind of behavior,<br>as mimicking stupid things.</p>
  <p>Even so, paid fake education, fake classes,<br>still got the best of them, often they only see the basics.</p>
  <p>They do not see the full effects that indoctrination has on them,<br>they may explain that money, politics and borders are required.</p>
  <p>But they have no explanation for homeless camps, people dying from poverty,<br>mentally ill being thrown into prisons as punishment for their minds falling apart.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loevinger%27s_stages_of_ego_development">Mimicry is actually normal part of early human development</a>,<br>but it is only healthy when you are surrounded by wise beings.</p>
  <p>Due to poverty most people are surrounded by pleasant to consume media,<br>which presents a dumbed down, unrealistic personalities.</p>
  <p>In extreme cases inexperienced people may also face a corrupt local culture,<br>that has evolved to take advantage of them.</p>
  <p>Some cultures may present drug dealers, corrupt police or officials,<br>as good to the community.</p>
  <p>In such cases mimicry is used to propagate a culture of crime,<br>in which schools of any kind of any quality are seen as the only way out of that cycle.</p>
  <p>In most extreme cases, mimicry is exploited to the maximum,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzZh2wstj88">it becomes a component in a process of indoctrination</a>.</p>
  <p>Indoctrination is not just used to propagate religions,<br>but also manufacture consent for various other terrible things.</p>
  <p>Things like, human trafficking, military recruitment, propagation of misguided politics, the spreading of science denial,<br>and an entire array of subcultures that force human beings to blindly act against their self interests by disabling their judgment.</p>
  <p>Depending on where you fall on this spectrum,<br>keeping you in school - however ineffective it may be - can increase your chances of not not having your mind hijacked.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The terrible thing about indoctrination,<br>is that the victims can’t see that they are hijacked.</p>
  <p>A boy selling drugs will think he is an independent thinker,<br>but not only is he a tool, his entire body of wisdom will be ripped out of him.</p>
  <p>A deeply religious person will be pushed into slavery during their life,<br>under a promise of paradise after death - not realizing that life <em>is</em> the paradise.</p>
  <p>Your teachers are also victims or indoctrination,<br>they believe that if they take the same steps everyone else is taking, then everything will work out.</p>
  <p>But like the boy selling drugs, they are blindly participating,<br>in a fantasy existence.</p>
  <p>Carter professionals who pushed Real Education, Wisdom, a Meaningful Relationship away for some promotion, or long therm goal that forces them to act against themselves,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">often do not awaken from their bad judgment until they face some life threatening illness</a>.</p>
  <p>And the entire world out of its own complexity,<br>has also indoctrinated it self into the concept of money.</p>
  <p>Nobody intended to create a global state of poverty,<br>and force the world into acting against its best self interests.</p>
  <p>And yet we are ignoring climate change, mass incarceration, fake education,<br>we are even tolerating starvation and homelessness in a world full of empty homes and stores that throw out food to keep their prices high.</p>
  <p>Even beyond money, we use the concept of national borders,<br>a concept that has shown to induce war, weapons manufacturing, and keeping thousands of active nuclear weapons that are ready to destroy major cities around the world, under the already sick and and dangerously quickly eroding fantasy of Peace by means of Mutually Assured Destruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Adults will tell you that borders and money are how the world works,<br>the same way a cult member will recite their creed.</p>
  <p>Just like a cult member, a victim of indoctrination, of fake education, of a fantasy existence,<br>they will only protest, unable to answer in any coherent way.</p>
  <p>A victim of indoctrination, can only protect their false beliefs,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVV2Zk88beY">few will ever learn to see outside of themselves</a>.</p>
  <p>The best way to defeat this vulnerability,<br>is to prevent it’s abuse in the first place.</p>
  <p>And that can only be accomplished by means of real education,<br>effective education, one that has positive and life changing effects on the student.</p>

  <p>The primary purpose of this tutorial is to show teenagers,<br>a path towards real education, with real results, that brings in a real fistful of dollars; opening real gateways towards interesting futures, that they might not have considered before.</p>
  <p>Fundamentally this is an introduction to creating 3D printable models and products,<br>the text version links to all the video tutorials needed to get started.</p>
  <p>It will only sound confusing until the first couple of hours of linked tutorials and related videos,<br>I wanted to create a very short thing that takes one from product design, to company configuration, and sales ideas.</p>

  <p>Let's get the confusing stuff out of the way, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=FreeCAD+tutorial">FreeCAD</a> is stable enough when used with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=PrusaSlicer+tutorial">PrusaSlicer</a>,<br>but it is best to create Pads or Extrusions in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Inkscape+tutorial">Inkscape</a>.</p>
  <p>Import SVG as Geometry, and it will become a cube,<br>that you can then trow into a body and create a pad or Extrusion out of.</p>
  <p>The ability to import properly sized SVG canvas into a Raspberry PI case or a Wallet,<br>instantly creates a perfect design method.</p>

  <p>All of this is very sketchy, pun intended,<br>as Open Source applications are created out of other applications or libraries.</p>
  <p>They are piped together like commands on the command line,<br>this is not a bug, or a flaw.</p>
  <p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=P5.js+tutorial">p5.js</a> create something impossible with it,<br>and then create an extrusion out of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Now, apply the extrusion by means of Subtraction to the face of your wallet,<br>or computer case.</p>
  <p>And now you have a product,<br>with a unique design.</p>
  <p>But don't print your product until it is sold,<br>call it products on demand.</p>

  <p>If someone was to ask you, "How long would it take you to print 1,000 wallets for me?",<br>you'd say that's the old way - we don't operate like that - we only print or CNC when a sale is made we keep a very small stock of components to ship fast.</p>

  <p>One can create scenarios where someone just made a 1,000 orders,<br>but that is not how sales work, these are anomalies.</p>
  <p>If you get a 1,000 orders overnight it will only happen once,<br>but if you begin getting 1,000 orders every night - then your investors will give you seed money for a 100 printers, for 10% of your profits.</p>
  <p>But, don't invent anomalous scenarios,<br>either don't advertise more than you can print, or just have someone like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=shapeways">Shapeways</a> as a backup.</p>

  <p>Product On Demand is a fancy idea,<br>but not everybody likes this kind of thing.</p>
  <p>I for one am not a fan, I like businesses that are purely digital, I am most likely to sell 3D models for printing,<br>this preference arises from a certain instability.</p>
  <p>And privately I define this instability as:<br>all ideas are worth one dollar, and nine out of ten businesses will fail, period.</p>

  <p>I never seriously entertained the creation of 1 company,<br>I was only ever interested in creating a series to ten small unique independent-companies.</p>
  <p>So independent that they could be easily sold off,<br>strictly separate down to passwords and email addresses used to buy domain names.</p>
  <p>Uniqueness of companies, is like good art,<br>you know the dividing line when you see it.</p>

  <p>A good company just focuses on doing one thing well,<br>I'd say don't make a company that creates wallets and cases, under the umbrella of creative 3D printing.</p>
  <p>Nobody searches for 3D objects, people don't even think about how a wallet is made,<br>they search for minimalist wallet, or Raspberry Pi case.</p>
  <p>It could be CNC, plastic or aluminum, milling or printing, they don't care about that,<br>and they don't want to see a place that sells cases and wallets because that is weird, and distracting.</p>

  <p>Now onto the products,<br>don't create fake buttons - that is a huge mistake - If it is something that represents an action it must function for real,</p>
  <p>But not even during prototyping, should you ever print something out that has no design,<br>personally I chose futuristic design that one can expect from sci-fi movies.</p>
  <p>Whether you are making a wallet, or a bat belt, a raspberry pi case, or a case for a cluster of them,<br>they must be fascinating-to-look-at and perform their function in a slightly unusual way, don't make a lid that opens, make one that rotates.</p>

  <p>I think the variation can be found in modular phone cases, modular wallets, modular cases,<br>Raspberry Pi for example is shipped with a case, that can't be enlarged in any way.</p>
  <p>I have not yet noticed modular cases,<br>aside from the flat acrylic ones, which are more like protectors.</p>
  <p>To ship a modular case, all one designs,<br>is a snapping mechanism for a stack of extenders, ensuring that when an extender need a hole, one can cut through it with scissors (it would become an open rectangle)</p>

  <p>A modular minimalist wallet,<br>is what grownups that had LEGO in their childhood dream about.</p>
  <p>There is a countless number of ways to do it,<br>but one of the most fascinating is to sell a 3D model, and point the customer to some metal screws, a latch, for extra $3 they can trick their wallet out.</p>
  <p>More than that, one could design a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB9dBXGjpZY">throwie flashlight</a> extension that would sanp on the face of the wallet,<br>a plastic button would push an LED wire to the battery, all the customer needs fo rthat is CR2032 battery and a 5mm white LED.</p>

  <p>The software and 3D modeling, and now SVG is a little scary,<br>but that is becasue I am presenting it all at once, as a whole - which is important for a text like this - to show the whole business.</p>
  <p>Ideally, 3D is something one just kind of figures out over the course of one's teenage days,<br>or early 20's, or just by going over the tutorials with helpful friends.</p>
  <p>This is not school, there is no need to waste time on math or some nonsense about the Z axis,<br>get a pocket protector, calculator, a scratch awl, maybe a pen flashlight to trick out your protector like no tomorrow - and get $15 electronic calipers (that's the only real tool you need).</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>And finally there is a number of business configuration that you can employ,<br>you can sell pre-assembled products on a website that keep track of inventory numbers great for wallets, you can sell ready to assemble kits useful for raspberry pi cases.</p>
  <p>You can sell 3D models along with links to extras, that people can print out themselves or use an online 3D printing service,<br>or you can sell licensing for other people to print and dell your products, or re-sell your models online.</p>
  <p>Lastly, you can sell entire on-line businesses, that are filled with 3D models that you hired designers to create,<br>here the customer would have to invest in their own 3D printers or printing service, or just sell 3D models for printing or other companies.</p>

  <p>To start begin by creating the LED flashlight out of a 5mm LED and a CR2032 battery,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gokN9xNG94U">while you order a cheap 3D printer like Ender 3 v2</a>.</p>
  <p>Take some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=FreeCAD+tutorial">FreeCAD</a> tutorials,<br>and get something printed out.</p>
  <p>Get a feel for leveling the print bed, for what not to do in FreeCAD,<br>and finally use your custom little flashlight at night.</p>
  <p>Now you are an inventor equipped with your first fully functional product,<br>a product that is sure to launch you on great many day dreams.</p>

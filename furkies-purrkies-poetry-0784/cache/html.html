  <p>Use the Warp Transform Tool in GIMP,<br>but keep hardness and strength low.</p>
  <p>You want to make gradual changes,<br>aim to revisit areas of the face multiple times, be gentle.</p>

  <p>With a large Move Pixels Warp Transform,<br>move the bottom of the face up.</p>
  <p>This creates a more youthful face,<br>with very little effort.</p>
  <p>Now slightly enrage the upper head,<br>the effect is that the rest of the head becomes smaller.</p>
  <p>The point is not to make the forehead bigger,<br>but everything else smaller.</p>

  <p>Make the lips slightly narrower, by moving pixels,<br>or just use the shrink area setting.</p>
  <p>Round off the jaw line,<br>make sure it curves smoothly.</p>
  <p>And try to make the chin more pointed,<br>if possible.</p>

  <p>Enlarge the eyes with grow area setting,<br>a litter goes a long way.</p>
  <p>But you will easily see something is wrong,<br>if you go too far.</p>
  <p>And consider enlarging the iris,<br>so that it fill more of the eye.</p>
  <p>Once you get to painting it,<br>make sure it glows and it full of crystal clear reflections.</p>

  <p>You may experiment with the nose,<br>but since we changed everything around it it may not need work.</p>
  <p>Be sure to zoom way out, and try to see the face from a distance,<br>it is easier to see where you went too far.</p>
  <p>But be careful because our minds are constantly,<br>over-processing this face.</p>
  <p>Humans are really good at faces,<br>and our brains love gentle strangeness here.</p>
  <p>What may seem like a big forehead,<br>may actually be a face that is too long...</p>

  <p>In 1995 My stupid internship,<br>forced me to copy yellow pages.</p>
  <p>But, there was a photo of Bill Clinton,<br>gently holding his pregnant belly.</p>
  <p>In the many months that I worked there,<br>I was forbidden from going anywhere near the designers.</p>
  <p>Those were powerful computers,<br>only a company could afford them.</p>
  <p>I went to a store somewhere on Fifth Avenue,<br>I don't think it was the Apple store, but they had Apples.</p>
  <p>I walked up to it to see if I could manipulate on there,<br>and the damn webcam that they were demoing.</p>
  <p>Was creating a dithered video,<br>basically black dots on white background.</p>
  <p>Maybe it was a filter,<br>maybe the camera was full color.</p>
  <p>But, it was all slow and crushing,<br>I had no computer that could manipulate real color.</p>
  <p>There is no worst feeling,<br>than being limited by the technology of your time.</p>

  <p>By the way my whole photo manipulation fancy truly begun,<br>on a plane on my way to America.</p>
  <p>I had a fancy magazine with me,<br>and the article that caught my attention was entitled:</p>
  <p>"How To Spot Photo Manipulated Photographs",<br>and had some very useful photos.</p>

  <p>This was a real breakthrough moment for me,<br>because until then...</p>
  <p>The best graphics I've ever seen,<br>were shots of Commodore Amiga Demos in Magazines.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>What I took away from the article,<br>is that photo manipulators always get the shadows wrong.</p>
  <p>So all you need to do,<br>is check the shadow.</p>
  <p>Or in this case,<br>make sure the neck is not too long when you move the lower part of head up.</p>
  <p>Once I had a proper Pentium 90 computer,<br>I became aware of Kai's Power Tools, and dis some early photo manip.</p>
  <p>But I needed to learn many programming languages,<br>about a year after high-school like all nerds back then, I was already making web pages.</p>
  <p>But that is a whole different,<br>story.</p>

  <p>People will be critical of photo-manipulating source images,<br>and then using them as direct image reference for your paintings.</p>
  <p>They just don't understand modern art,<br>they want to make money and pretend they are special.</p>
  <p>And that they will try to force you to create art,<br>the way we created art a hundred years ago, that is just assault.</p>
  <p>If the critics begin make your experience toxic,<br>or disrupt the harmony of your community.</p>
  <p>Immediately turn to the platform tools,<br>and report them - don't argue with them.</p>
  <p>If the platform is crap,<br>find out which accelerator they used and their backers or investors, and send them screenshots.</p>
  <p>Critics are only attempting to dominate, to extinguish,<br>to feel superior by means of hate, by the simplest means.</p>
  <p>They are just creepy children in their heads,<br>they never grew up, and they many never achieve anything.</p>
  <p>Don't argue with them, don't explain anything,<br>just let them self destruct.</p>

  <p>You don't have to do it,<br>but consider teaching a class.</p>
  <p>Especially if you are still in High School,<br>help others experience a fragment of sillies of art.</p>
  <p>Kindle their spirits,<br>and lead the way.</p>
  <p>But please note: You should never feel bad that you maybe too shy to teach,<br>shy is beautiful, like in my case, it just means you'll do your lectures later on.</p>

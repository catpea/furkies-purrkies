  "text": "The secret of good art is Laughter,\nmake your friends and classmates laugh.\n\nUse the Warp Transform Tool in GIMP,\nbut keep hardness and strength low.\nYou want to make gradual changes,\naim to revisit areas of the face multiple times, be gentle.\n\nWith a large Move Pixels Warp Transform,\nmove the bottom of the face up.\nThis creates a more youthful face,\nwith very little effort.\nNow slightly enrage the upper head,\nthe effect is that the rest of the head becomes smaller.\nThe point is not to make the forehead bigger,\nbut everything else smaller.\n\nMake the lips slightly narrower, by moving pixels,\nor just use the shrink area setting.\nRound off the jaw line,\nmake sure it curves smoothly.\nAnd try to make the chin more pointed,\nif possible.\n\nEnlarge the eyes with grow area setting,\na litter goes a long way.\nBut you will easily see something is wrong,\nif you go too far.\nAnd consider enlarging the iris,\nso that it fill more of the eye.\nOnce you get to painting it,\nmake sure it glows and it full of crystal clear reflections.\n\nYou may experiment with the nose,\nbut since we changed everything around it it may not need work.\nBe sure to zoom way out, and try to see the face from a distance,\nit is easier to see where you went too far.\nBut be careful because our minds are constantly,\nover-processing this face.\nHumans are really good at faces,\nand our brains love gentle strangeness here.\nWhat may seem like a big forehead,\nmay actually be a face that is too long...\nWhere you need to pull the bottom of the face up,\na little bit more.\n\nIn 1995 My stupid internship,\nforced me to copy yellow pages.\nBut, there was a photo of Bill Clinton,\ngently holding his pregnant belly.\nIn the many months that I worked there,\nI was forbidden from going anywhere near the designers.\nThose were powerful computers,\nonly a company could afford them.\nI went to a store somewhere on Fifth Avenue,\nI don't think it was the Apple store, but they had Apples.\nI walked up to it to see if I could manipulate on there,\nand the damn webcam that they were demoing.\nWas creating a dithered video,\nbasically black dots on white background.\nMaybe it was a filter,\nmaybe the camera was full color.\nBut, it was all slow and crushing,\nI had no computer that could manipulate real color.\nThere is no worst feeling,\nthan being limited by the technology of your time.\n\nBy the way my whole photo manipulation fancy truly begun,\non a plane on my way to America.\nI had a fancy magazine with me,\nand the article that caught my attention was entitled:\n\"How To Spot Photo Manipulated Photographs\",\nand had some very useful photos.\n\nThis was a real breakthrough moment for me,\nbecause until then...\nThe best graphics I've ever seen,\nwere shots of Commodore Amiga Demos in Magazines.\n\nWhat I took away from the article,\nis that photo manipulators always get the shadows wrong.\nSo all you need to do,\nis check the shadow.\nOr in this case,\nmake sure the neck is not too long when you move the lower part of head up.\nOnce I had a proper Pentium 90 computer,\nI became aware of Kai's Power Tools, and dis some early photo manip.\nBut I needed to learn many programming languages,\nabout a year after high-school like all nerds back then, I was already making web pages.\nBut that is a whole different,\nstory.\n\nPeople will be critical of photo-manipulating source images,\nand then using them as direct image reference for your paintings.\nThey just don't understand modern art,\nthey want to make money and pretend they are special.\nAnd that they will try to force you to create art,\nthe way we created art a hundred years ago, that is just assault.\nIf the critics begin make your experience toxic,\nor disrupt the harmony of your community.\nImmediately turn to the platform tools,\nand report them - don't argue with them.\nIf the platform is crap,\nfind out which accelerator they used and their backers or investors, and send them screenshots.\nCritics are only attempting to dominate, to extinguish,\nto feel superior by means of hate, by the simplest means.\nThey are just creepy children in their heads,\nthey never grew up, and they many never achieve anything.\nDon't argue with them, don't explain anything,\njust let them self destruct.\n\nThe brilliant you,\ncouldn't count all your giggles due to this style of art, even if you tried.\nYour whole classroom will ask you for these doodles,\nknow that this is true art, that giggles pave the way.\n\nYou don't have to do it,\nbut consider teaching a class.\nEspecially if you are still in High School,\nhelp others experience a fragment of sillies of art.\nKindle their spirits,\nand lead the way.\nBut please note: You should never feel bad that you maybe too shy to teach,\nshy is beautiful, like in my case, it just means you'll do your lectures later on.",

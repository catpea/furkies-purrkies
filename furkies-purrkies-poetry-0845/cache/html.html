  <p>In a way Visual programming in new,<br>and hardly anyone has a clue.</p>
  <p>It does not come with a guarantee,<br>that is the biggest problem I see.</p>

  <p>In the world of programming,<br>which is a loving, and funny, and wonderfully challenging world.</p>
  <p>There is this huge question,<br>and even a huge-er problem.</p>
  <p>The question is:<br>"Does your program fix problems that people actually have?"</p>
  <p>And the huge-er problem, is,<br>that everything is broken.</p>
  <p>Phone are missing functionality, operating systems keep crashing,<br>new products need firmware upgrades...</p>
  <p>And if you are thrifty or cheap,<br><a href="https://youtu.be/uhyM-bhzFsI?t=674">hackers have access to a detailed map of your home</a>.</p>

  <p>So what does a visual programming language fix?<br>and is it really broken?</p>
  <p>The file structure of a program,<br>does not represent what the program does.</p>
  <p>Visual programming languages,<br>can create maps of the program flow.</p>
  <p>And if we sprinkle in <a href="https://yeoman.io/authoring/">yeoman templates</a>,<br>we can eat the cake and have the files properly structured too.</p>
  <p>Is it a problem people have,<br>yeah, programmers have to jump hoops to bridge concepts.</p>
  <p>Here is an <a href="https://rete.js.org/#/docs/controls">example of a confusing adapter in Rete.js</a>,<br>that is needed to connect an input box to the node in the programming language.</p>
  <p>It makes code neat, it makes sense,<br>but it also crushes Rete.js programs under their own weight and non-portable code.</p>
  <p>There is potential here to create a nicer front-end,<br>but unless it comes from the developer then things will get proken pretty soon.</p>
  <p><a href="https://nobackend.org/dreamcode.html">A really neat example of pretty code, is Dream Code</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRKRg1O3H0s">but the world took a completely different path than this creating even more complexity</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>And then the pink elephant that nobody talks about,<br>the web is about text, and maybe navigation maps, not really about connecting boxes together.</p>
  <p>And beyond that you need a team of developers to create a visual programming language in a reasonable stretch of time,<br>and you may need multiple and unique prototypes to get it right.</p>
  <p>Even if you request that everything works exactly like Blender's Geometry Nodes,<br>there are no guarantees here, everything is new, and you may end up trying to fix problems that people don't have, anyway.</p>

  <p>The web has a wisdom about it self,<br>for one, when a program is written correctly...</p>

  <p>There is no guarantee that visual programming on a phone,<br>will be fixing the problems that people actually have.</p>
  <p>All the screen pinching,<br>and messing around with little wires...</p>
  <p>And trying to connect an output of some math node that is literally two feet away on a smartphone,<br>seems like trouble, and quite a development risk to take.</p>
  <p>It is a pretty terrible thing to receive a fully functional program after a some months,<br>and then end up not using it for anything.</p>

  <p>Imagine hiring a team of developers,<br>and the program just can't work on a little screen, or can't really help anybody with anything.</p>

  <p>The big problem with visual programming,<br>is passing information to nodes.</p>
  <p>You may have a play song or sound node,<br>and then you want the user to pick what sound to play.</p>
  <p>So the play sound node is just a beautiful square box, neat and simple,<br>and it is part of a reasonably readable chain of actions.</p>
  <p>For example open window, let user pick song, verify something, or make a song purchase,<br>and then you arrive at he play song/sound node and now there is trouble.</p>
  <p>Because you have to drag something from pick a song node,<br>to play a song node, and after a while you have all these wires everywhere.</p>
  <p>And no making the wires of the nodes that are not in the view-port transparent,<br>does not help, because we have a mess here, it is a mess.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We tried to escape from a mess of files,<br>of from the mess of arbitrary GraphQL queries with random data quota, and we just created a mess of wires.</p>
  <p>And no you can't just group program functions together in to a single node,<br>because the input of that node will still require the wires.</p>
  <p>Visual Programming the way we have it today,<br>does not yet fix much.</p>

  <p>And the elephant is not the only animal in the room,<br>I don't know what animal this is, but it has to do with time travel.</p>
  <p>Because a programmer, should be allowed to create a node,<br>in behavior description only.</p>
  <p>And the visual programming language, will complain,<br>that he program cannot run because this node does not yet exist.</p>
  <p>That the programmer has to create it,<br>and that the created node must pass the behavior test.</p>
  <p>For example, we say we want an UPPERCASE node,<br>that makes all the letters upercase.</p>
  <p>And we describe that, the test is to fail until,<br>the word 'cat' (in lowercase) comes out of the node in uppercase.</p>
  <p>It is a simple test, and a simple mechanism,<br>that allows the creation of large programs, that are yet to be programmed.</p>
  <p>There can be a bounty back-end where programmers will get bounties,<br>for programming those nodes.</p>
  <p>Here the developer or a clever company armed with this program,<br>will watch it bubble up into reality.</p>
  <p>At the very least, the programmer will get a decent todo list,<br>and the project lead, perhaps a reasonable time estimate.</p>

  <p>To add insult to injury,<br>these wire based programs, can sometimes branch creating large trees.</p>
  <p>Here there maybe a large reuse of variables,<br>as the program takes different routes.</p>
  <p>And now we triple, or quintuple,<br>the number of wires.</p>
  <p>Here, trying to fix a quirk that potentially exists on multiple unreadable branches,<br>makes visual programming a real problem, and the whole effort becomes pointless.</p>

  <p>And I just want to throw this one last thing in there,<br>aligning nodes to make them more visually appealing, or to make them go around come cluster of nodes - is a huge waste of time, and quite a distraction.</p>

  <p>While I continue testing <a href="https://rete.js.org/#/examples/basic">Rete.js</a>,<br>and now <a href="https://jerosoler.github.io/Drawflow/">Dataflow</a>...</p>
  <p>Given the complexity on the visual programming language implementation end,<br>and the potential readability or lost variable issues...</p>
  <p>It seem to me that the first principle of Visual Programming,<br>should be Smartphones and Tablets first.</p>
  <p>And here <a href="https://js.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape.js</a> maybe a better visualization library,<br>as it serves as a map and has automated layout, and the library is complete very little programming is required here.</p>
  <p>Once a node which here is more abstract, is clicked,<br>then the smartphone will enter a web-page for that node, perhaps even open it in a new tab.</p>
  <p>All the operations will be performed by a wizard, or a step by step interface,<br>where if someone is trying to add a new node, the page will just list all the available nodes with just standard web technologies.</p>
  <p>The cytoscape map is a map of flows within the program,<br>they are simple and readable.</p>
  <p>The node configuration values, all the wires that create an unreadable mess,<br>are replaced with values that are injected into the entire flow control stream.</p>
  <p>When the program is ran, all the unused values are automatically removed,<br>but creating a verbose linter is a great option too.</p>
  <p>It will complain that, "Hey, you have a song name in the flow control stream,<br>but the last time you used it was in the play node, do you want me to remove it from the stream at that point?"</p>

  <p>Finally, does this fix a problem that people actually have,<br>yes, it shows the flow control of programs graphically.</p>
  <p>And allows even the novice user, to inject variables into the stream,<br>such as email by asking "What is your email Address".</p>
  <p>And then it allows to use that value later on in the flow control stream,<br>or branching streams, in an alert when computer running out of disk-space or when water detected in the basement node.</p>
  <p>Here there is room for a node to suggest to the user what it needs,<br>and perhaps even go as far as to offer injecting an input node that asks for email.</p>

  <p>Visual Programming is a great idea,<br>but this does not mean, we need to create visual nodes with little input boxes and property sockets.</p>
  <p>Though it does require that we need to think in streams or flows, and nodes,<br>so that the end result is just bunch of easy to comprehend boxes (or nodes) connected together.</p>
  <p>Visual Programming just means,<br>that we have to help the user see how the entire program flows.</p>

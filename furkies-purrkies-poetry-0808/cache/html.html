  <p>Programming 3D objects is as important,<br>as Digital Painting, and Music Composition, and Programming.</p>
  <p>And combined with a 3D printer,<br>in less than gadzillion hours you get to hold your creation in your hand.</p>
  <p>And that is one hecking reward,<br>for learning a new talent.</p>
  <p>Though I want to make it clear, don't worry about this if you don't like it,<br>it will come on its own, later - 3D modeling must always be about having fun.</p>

  <p>After a full day in there,<br>I still fell strongly about not doing everything via Node Geometry for Jewelry.</p>
  <p>Everything I did today was straight up nodes,<br>but that would be too cruel for making fun jewelry.</p>
  <p>Though, Geometry Nodes are are good for ring sizing,<br>it is neat to make ring variations in all the sizes.</p>
  <p>Jewelry or decorative items are organic,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSKO7rE0u1I">they need a flowing bubbly-bobbly seed, to get things going</a>.</p>
  <p>Now for a pencil box, or wallets, or superhero belts.<br>oh my gosh, Geometry Nodes save months of design work.</p>

  <p>Maybe years of design work,<br>it is kind of crazy.</p>
  <p>Printing clothes, or armor has a huge flaw,<br>because you need to know a personâ€™s dimensions...</p>
  <p>BEFORE, you design the Iron Man armor or helmet,<br>or a New Generation Plastic Attire for a Cat Walk in Paris.</p>
  <p>But with these geometry nodes,<br>you can design the suit first...</p>
  <p>And then let it reconfigure it self,<br>just based on a handful of measurements.</p>

  <p>Wallet, or Superhero-Belt design,<br>requires millimeter precision.</p>
  <p>This requires spending a lot of time,<br>aligning things.</p>
  <p>An inset lid, with an outside latch,<br>is not a fun thing to craft.</p>
  <p>But with Geometry Nodes,<br>it becomes a matter of simple math.</p>
  <p>More than that,<br>the thickness of wallet walls becomes a parameter you can change.</p>

  <p>While none of the documentation I found was useful,<br>internet videos are hard to complain about.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately the way to learn from those,<br>is to go along with what they are trying to teach.</p>
  <p>And then later come around,<br>and use that knowledge to create what you need.</p>
  <p>But as a bonus,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZtiiFUBqb5dXBul4cEhTTsiUmVx3ebzC">you learn tings in videos that you wouldn't encounter if you had really good documentation</a>.</p>

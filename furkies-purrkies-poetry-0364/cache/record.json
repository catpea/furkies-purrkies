  "print": "<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Let us define some things up front:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Teaching, or being taught, is when someone else is trying to make you learn.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Learning, is when you your self reach out for knowledge.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Studying, means looking at something up close.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Studying for an exam, is code for memorization.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Memorization in context of standardized education,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is gaining a temporary ability to mindlessly recall some facts for a matching test.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Before I learned English I memorized the opening speech in Star Trek TNG,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the theme song to Cheers.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The way I did this was to write down the sounds I heard in the speech,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">in my own native language like this:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">\"Dis ar de vojadzes ov startrek enterprys\",</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I knew what the speech was about, but I wasn't able to match up the words quite yet.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">At 16 or so, I wouldn't know how to write it down,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">in away that I could get it right.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">What ultimately helped me learn English was cartoons and closed captions,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and above all moving to America, I had a reason, I had a want, I had a passion for English.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The only thing that didn't help me learn English was Shakespeare,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">which I tried to read because everyone said it was English.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Though I struggled with the <span>Balcony Scene<sup>[1]</sup></span> in Romeo and Juliet,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I also fell in love with it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I memorized a lot of quotes from the back of the book,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they just roll of my tongue to this day.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Learning, requires that you have a need to learn something,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Memorizing, has nothing to do with learning, it is all about acting.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Yes, I am able to recite the speech from Star Trek in real English,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">even though I learned it as babble and gibberish, but that is the most horrible way to learn to recite something from memory, it is a joke.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To learn something, means to have enough connecting fiber to know it without mnemonics or tricks,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">to learn something requires the involvement of a kind of love.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A good example of that kind of love is coming to country that you always wanted to live in,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and absorbing things, you don't memorize, memorization is thin, hollow, temporary, easily damaged or warped.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I never sat down to memorize English words,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I just had this massive overwhelming urge to understand what the <span>Ninja Turtles<sup>[2]</sup></span> were talking about.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I wanted to be in on their jokes, once I learned to separate what I was hearing into words,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">which is just a function of becoming familiar with the language.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I found the words most frequently used were indicative of structure,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the meaning was found in the context.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Context is something you get out of what has been happening in the cartoon,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">where you think the cartoon is going, where it usually goes, what characters usually do, and what you understood thus far.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I only recently learned that the opening intro says \"heroes in a half shell\",</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I always heard it as \"hap shell\" (H.A.P.) and because I wasn't used to hearing that elsewhere, I assumed the word is just mangled.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">(I was familiar with word half and shell back when watching the cartoons, but I still think half shell is a pretty odd way of describing something dome shaped.)</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It was a big deal for me to find something from Ninja Turtles,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">in <span>Inspector Gadget<sup>[3]</sup></span>, and <span>The DJ Kat Show<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">For those of you who think it is crazy or silly to learn from cartoons,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">take a look at one of the better alternatives: <span>Follow Me - Beginner, Part 1<sup>[5]</sup></span></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I won't mention text books here,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">as they aren't useful at all, six months of closed captions is all it takes to get to story books.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To end this note, I wanted to mention Audio Books,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">at a certain point, sooner than later, books like Top 100 Poems, and anything by Bill Bryson, take care of the rest.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So as long as the person is learning at their own pace everything will work out,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but to force someone to learn faster, is very cruel, and may put an end to that person's delicate curiosities.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Making them feel stupid for learning at their own pace by grading them down,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">will probably cause great and long lasting harm to their self esteem and interests.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Forcing children to learn within time constraints,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and punishing them for failure, will only force them into temporary memorization as a way of protecting themselves.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Unethical schools will exploit that to their advantage,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they will keep the kids stressed out and purposefully force them into meaningless memorization so that everyone gets paid.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There is a concept of a <span>Elaborative Rehearsal<sup>[6]</sup></span> that somewhat shines some light on this cruelty,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">when contrasted with the notion of a Maintenance Rehearsal.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But even Elaborative Rehearsal does not come close what it means to Actually Really Learn,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">a person can only learn or as we should call it soak up, inhale, integrate new knowledge, when they are moving along a path that is of great interest to them.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">That means, people can only really learn what they are interested in,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and will not learn if they are taught in segments by teachers.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is difficult to believe that <span>schools do not work<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it maybe impossible for many to believe they are an insult to the younger generations.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To make headway in this discussion, we must resist speaking in the bare abstract terms,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we must only speak in terms of specific subjects (like Math), or areas like (Science), and focus on reproducible results.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A child that learns mathematics for real will end up creating computer game engines,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">visualization frameworks, computer games, generative graphics, and even generative music.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section

  "text": "Conscious life is a magnificent accident on such an impossibly large scale,\nthat it becomes the single most important miracle in the universe.\n\nYou, I, all the other Earthlings,\nand all the other conscious life out there: we are the meaning of this universe.\n\nWe are all connected with this incredible feat of emergence; Consciousness,\nit does not matter where we come from or how we look - if we can see ourselves - we are Family.\n\nOur minds were crafted by an adaptive process,\nthat step by step, improved on the previous.\n\nThe steps were not aimed at anything in particular,\nand are far from perfect.\n\nBut consciousness is something different,\nit is not random, it is not a function of mere adaptive mechanics of accidents, and fundamental principles.\n\nConsciousness allows us to deliberately and in foresight, cross the line between mere evolution,\nonward into Freedom of Will, Love Of Life, and Power of Knowledge, and Light Of Wisdom; and Love, Good Will, and Lasting Peace brought on by Greatness of Vision, Heart and Spirit.\n\nBut.\n\nWe must deliberately aim to push away the flaws that the meanderings of nature instilled in us,\nby the countless accidents of the process of our initial emergence as conscious beings.\n\nIf we don't detach,\nour minds will be held back by racism, xenophobia, nationalism, group-think, fear, hate, and blindness.\n\nWe will point Nuclear Weapons at each other,\nand list the flags of our enemies as if it was a checklist for advancement.\n\nWhat may seem like a soap opera news program to the educated,\ncan be perceived as reality and opportunity to the poor, starving or disadvantaged, who did not know to seek real education.\n\nWe have introduced a device of deliberate advancement for all Human Beings,\nthat device was supposed to pull us towards a Wiser State of Existence.\n\nBut its aim was lost, it was an experiment that has never fully reached its goal,\nand ended up being used by the poor, as means to put food on the table.\n\nThat noble experiment.\nwas organized education.\n\nToday it may cost as much as a million dollars or more and in unforgivable student loans,\nto become a medical expert.\n\nDon't bother trying to understand why schools failed, there is no time,\nsimply accept the responsibility for your own education, and begin immediately.\n\nThere are many flaws in our perception,\nthe biggest one is our tendency to follow leaders.\n\nBut the act of following, is an act of destruction,\nwe are each to lead, we are never to follow, ever.\n\nSelf education by means of reading or listening to books held in high esteem by the world's most prominent intellectuals,\npaves the road towards a balanced and enlightened view of the world, and the view of our place in it.\n\nLead,\nwe have followed before, and came all-too-close to the end..\n\nAll the people that hate, that want to cause harm, are just ill from lack of growing up, from lack of education,\nfrom standing in-place, without ever knowing to reach for books, for wisdom, and for greatness.\n\nWhen we stand in the place that we are born into,\nwe come under the control of the flaws, that consciousness, easily allows us to escape.\n\nYou must withstand the culture you are born into, the neighborhood you are born into,\nthe poverty you are born into, be it of mind, or wallet, or both.\n\nYou must resist the urge of belonging, cheaply and effortlessly,\nas that is the oldest recruitment mechanism to make a slave - to turn a young person, old and bitter.\n\nThis power must not end with you,\nyou have to ignite all the others that you meet in your great adventures.\n\nSo that the importance of fine and balanced self education,\nrings around the world.\n\nNot until we are all abloom with Knowledge and Wisdom,\nwill we have time to take to our careers, and retirement, and enjoyment of our golden age.\n\nThe un-educated world,\nis not a safe place for all.\n\nWe need real education,\nthe borders must go.\n\nBecome an inspiration,\nmay your poetry,\nnever be forgotten.\n\n\n[push away the flaws that the meanderings of nature instilled in us]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases\n[Lead]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM\n[we have followed before, and came all-too-close to the end.]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7EmLf4Xlq0",

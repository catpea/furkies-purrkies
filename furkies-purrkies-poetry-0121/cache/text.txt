No worries, the only real darkness is the Twilight of Hesitation,
it is dangerous because it makes time go by all too fast.
So you just have to make a promise to your self,
that each day will be a tiny-tiny itsy-bitsy better; than then previous.
Other than that, no cloud could ever stop the sun from rising,
nothing can endanger your brilliance, there is nothing to fear.

And brilliance,
brilliance leads to enlightenment.
So as long as you protect your light,
know that wisdom is your right.
Never stand still and always take to flight,
yours is enlightenment, the brightest of light.

Never has there been a night,
that was wasn't lit by light.
Never has there been a fight,
that wasn't won by Wisdom's Might.
Rise, rise in spite of the fright,
rise to no end in sight.

  <p>It is not differences that make people disagree,<br>it is what they know, what they internalized, what they inherited.</p>
  <p>Currently we have decided, to respect those beliefs,<br>no matter what they are so as long as they don't cause immediate harm.</p>
  <p>But looking at immediate impact of beliefs,<br>and waiting to deal with anomalies if any, maybe too simple at times of climate change, global health risks, and wars reemerging all too often.</p>

  <p>It maybe the perfect food for liars and manipulators,<br>as they don't usually plan just one step ahead, as we seem to be doing.</p>
  <p>For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ6H-Mz6hgw">rather than just punishing crime and keeping people in cages</a>,<br>we need to prevent people from fracturing from poverty and bad ideas, in the first place.</p>
  <p>And we should accept the responsibility for those that we have failed,<br>and not keep them in cages, but grant them a safe place where they can grow and eventually make a successful return.</p>
  <p>This is a very small example of the changes that we must make,<br>and I chose it because it both, demands wisdom, and shows what great restraint and eventually compassion our culture must rise to.</p>
  <p>The way money integrates without world must change as well,<br>no more homelessness, no more hunger, no more poverty, we are better than this, none of us would support such things is asked.</p>
  <p>And we have to fix schools, because electing the least of two wrongs, is madness,<br>any compromise between good and bad will only benefit the bad.</p>

  <p>We have to learn to look far into the future, and examine consequences at great depth,<br>we have to anticipate, predict, and learn to prevent.</p>
  <p>There is no other way to deal with war, or deal with climate,<br>we can't wait until war starts, we can't wait until it is too late to fix anything.</p>
  <p>Try, fail, learn, and try again, is a stupid idea,<br>it is not a plan of action, is a plan of inaction that causes reemergence of mistakes.</p>

  <p>There are many fairy tales we tell ourselves to accept reality,<br>and they "work", during the lifespan of that person, but that is a fool's achievement.</p>
  <p>Let me repeat that, only a fool celebrates lack of incidents,<br>that occur on a different time scale.</p>
  <p>War does not instantly happen,<br>it takes many decades to effectively and imperceptibly disable education and cripple culture with nationalism.</p>
  <p>Climate change or deforestation won't happen in a singe life time,<br>darkly speaking, scarcely few register that trees turned to shrubs.</p>
  <p>Viruses emerge on a scale, where we barely remember what it was like,<br>barely enough for people to refuse to wear masks to impede the spread during the worst of it.</p>

  <p>We also need to look at the content of a person's character,<br>voting on someone based on gut feeling, or because the other person outs herself as to think in terms of super-predators.</p>
  <p>The answer, to who do you vote for, when all candidates are bad,<br>is a stalemate.</p>
  <p>And we arrived here, because we neither have a culture that values wisdom,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">nor do we have a real educational system</a>.</p>
  <p>There are no worthy candidates, because election based systems,<br>demand a beautiful system of education.</p>
  <p>Today, we allow students to be bullied, we allow teachers not to see it,<br>and then we allow those students to be held back a year, allowing those bullies to seemingly stain that person for life.</p>
  <p>At best, we force students into obedience, by rewarding them for memorization,<br>and frightening them with punishment or homelessness.</p>
  <p>A real school, would teach,<br>what we have today is a fake school, a dangerous idea.</p>

  <p>When someone holds a different opinion, especially when that opinion is clearly wrong or unethical,<br>it simply means that they are a victim of a corroded culture.</p>
  <p>Ineffective education is such that often times both sides are wrong,<br>and they will never agree, a wreched stalemate.</p>
  <p>To truly capture all sides of all arguments,<br>one must assume that three is no side, no opinion to be had, until one is well educated, well read.</p>
  <p>The world can't keep disagreeing, because climate change, health risks, and and nuclear war,<br>care little for borders.</p>
  <p>It is a good feeling to hold an opinion, to feel passionately about something,<br>but it is a better feeling, when that opinion is based on love of wisdom.</p>
  <p>Wisdom is powerfully human, all too human,<br>and our love for it is a sign of how noble and beautiful human beings truly are.</p>
  <p>Look into your hear,<br>could you ever say "I hate wisdom" has such a phrase ever been uttered - it is because it is so deeply ours, so blindingly human.</p>

  <p>A philosopher once said that a culture is judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable,<br>those who live in poverty, those made ill, and those kept in prisons.</p>

  "text": "Disclaimer, this work of unchecked fancy is loosely inspired\nby Daniel Dennett's ideas on consciousness.\n\n\"But as Descartes observed, even an infinitely powerful evil demon couldn't trick him into thinking he himself existed if he didn't exist:\ncogito ergo sum, â€œI think, therefore I am.\" -- Daniel Dennett\n\nI wrote 432 poems now,\nand I have no idea how.\n\nIt is never something that I want to write about,\nlike funny cats, new song and art ideas, or my workout.\n\nAnd even though I start my poem by concentrating,\nit is as if, I always end up waiting.\n\nAnd what _is_ this thing that I seem to end up wait for?\nas I sit and sit... staring at the boring floor.\n\nDoes the idea drive a little car?\nand does it make a little pit stop by some little bar?\n\nBecause, in my opinion the idea is _always_ late,\nwhy can't it just... accelerate?\n\nAnd what happens when my little poems just keep going,\nis it a little boat that is rowing, or is it a wind that can't stop blowing?\n\nNot to say that I am long winded surely,\nplus I always try to write very maturity.\n\nBut I admit, a twenty minute narration,\nis a little heavy on the duration.\n\nWorse than that, the _whole_ audio book,\nis now measured in days a fact that I try to overlook.\n\nAfter almost half a thousand days,\nthe ideas seem to move along their _own_ roads and waterways.\n\nAs you can imagine, it gets rough when you get stuck,\nit is a little bit like chasing a duck.\n\nI always thought poems were simple things,\nbut that is not true as they have their own wings.\n\nEven if it is a long and scientific text,\nyou never know when you are going to end up next.\n\nI guess it is just one of those things that meander,\nlike some twitchy golden salamander.\n\nAs all of a sudden you go from commander,\nto a mere bystander.\n\nStanding in a corner holding a pen in one hand,\nand the other a piece of paper on which you doodled all the way to the end.\n\nThe words at the bottom are all squished,\nNO, you couldn't avoid scribbling them no matter how much you wished.\n\nAnd then no matter how hard you try to squint,\nyou can't read your own print.\n\nThe poem seems to end with the word jabberwock,\nunderlined twice, as it was the punchline, but it doesn't rhyme.\n\nAnd by now you forgot your final stanza,\nit is now gibberish and all kinds of extravaganza.\n\nThe idea drove away, the rhymes floated down the stream,\nthe duck ate the salamander, turns out they weren't even a team.\n\nBut, before you know it I finish poem #433,\nwhich has yet again written it self as if I were some helpless manatee.\n\nAnd I still don't know how poems can just write them themselves,\nthough this one for a change at-least reads as it was written by elves.\n\n\n[Daniel Dennett]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP1nmExfgpg",

  <p>The question of High School vs. One Thousand Narrated Books,<br>will help you doge all the cunning crooks.</p>
  <p>But the problem is bigger than it seems,<br>because fake education actually robs us of dreams.</p>
  <p>We just don't know what we could have had,<br>the business of stolen dreams is very sad.</p>

  <p>We need to be inspired to learn for real,<br>being force-fed random facts is a raw deal.</p>
  <p>Fake education,<br>has affected each and every nation.</p>
  <p>It is such an important thing to teach,<br>that a lecture should a long inspirational and life changing speech.</p>

  <p>We can learn on our own very well,<br>that we are treated like cattle should ring the alarm bell.</p>
  <p>Politicians, Judges, Presidents, and News Editors,<br>have all been tricked out of education by greedy predators.</p>
  <p>Teachers don't know they have sold the world,<br>by the time the consequences hit they will be too old.</p>

  <p>I call the act of filling our heads with pollution,<br>the problem of substitution.</p>
  <p>Cults do this to their victims too,<br>they plug their victims' curiosities with lies through and through.</p>
  <p>Institutions and corporations become corrupt one slip at a time,<br>no one person ever knows the pile of garbage they will climb.</p>

  <p>School funding and paycheck money is always the motivation,<br>as it is the one thing that all treat with great ovation.</p>
  <p>In the absence of well educated Politicians,<br>we will only ever witness worsening conditions.</p>

  <p>Fake education hurts the entire Humanity,<br>as it takes from our collective sanity.</p>
  <p>We have to rise; read books and learn on our own,<br>so that come our golden age we don't have regrets about things that we could have known.</p>
  <p>Self education is very beautiful and always meaningful,<br>a life changing book beats a whole week of school.</p>

  <p>And don't let them test you with some test,<br>as you are the only person that needs to be impressed.</p>

  <p>It is never about learning for the teacher,<br>but learning to enhance your future.</p>
  <p>Real lectures induce life changing knowledge,<br>it is never about merely graduating from college.</p>
  <p>Real education requires real results,<br>because real life, requires real adults.</p>

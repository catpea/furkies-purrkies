The question of High School vs. One Thousand Narrated Books,
will help you doge all the cunning crooks.

But the problem is bigger than it seems,
because fake education actually robs us of dreams.

We just don't know what we could have had,
the business of stolen dreams is very sad.

---

We need to be inspired to learn for real,
being force-fed random facts is a raw deal.

Fake education,
has affected each and every nation.

It is such an important thing to teach,
that a lecture should a long inspirational and life changing speech.

---

We can learn on our own very well,
that we are treated like cattle should ring the alarm bell.

Politicians, Judges, Presidents, and News Editors,
have all been tricked out of education by greedy predators.

Teachers don't know they have sold the world,
by the time the consequences hit they will be too old.

---

I call the act of filling our heads with pollution,
the problem of substitution.

Cults do this to their victims too,
they plug their victims' curiosities with lies through and through.

Institutions and corporations become corrupt one slip at a time,
no one person ever knows the pile of garbage they will climb.

---

School funding and paycheck money is always the motivation,
as it is the one thing that all treat with great ovation.

In the absence of well educated Politicians,
we will only ever witness worsening conditions.

[Today Politicians hardly know what questions to ask][pol],
and gathering meaningful information is their primary task.

---

Fake education hurts the entire Humanity,
as it takes from our collective sanity.

We have to rise; read books and learn on our own,
so that come our golden age we don't have regrets about things that we could have known.

Self education is very beautiful and always meaningful,
a life changing book beats a whole week of school.

---

We must also become successful business creators, and later, educators,
the world is not meant for mere workers and spectators.

[Do not allow the schools to blame you for bad grades][will],
they've been playing this game for decades.

And don't let them test you with some test,
as you are the only person that needs to be impressed.

---

It is never about learning for the teacher,
but learning to enhance your future.

Real lectures induce life changing knowledge,
it is never about merely graduating from college.

Real education requires real results,
because real life, requires real adults.

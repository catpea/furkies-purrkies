  <p>Maybe, it was the digital camera,<br>that started the change.</p>
  <p>Just being able to take a photo,<br>and quickly use it as digital painting reference transformed art.</p>
  <p>Today, using image reference tool under the Open Source Krita,<br>allows for tracing the shape and position of everything in the shot, and picking the correct color as well.</p>

  <p>This adds up to start the young artist,<br>at perfect hyperrealistic portraits.</p>
  <p>There are numerous paths to the heart of art,<br>but this one is the most colorful one, and here no teacher will ever stand in your way.</p>
  <p>This lights the flame of art deep in our soul,<br>long before ineffective teachers come to poison a person with ideas hand-eye-coordination, or what is and is not art.</p>

  <p>To this day critics born to the old era,<br>will ramble that we can't make the body as expressive as when we copy the initial sketch by hand.</p>
  <p>But it doesn't work like that,<br>because distortion isn't as respectful, as a sunny and colorful perfect portrait.</p>
  <p>A person's appearance,<br>is profoundly sacred.</p>
  <p>Painting a real person with fantasy stylizations grants that person a gift of a smile,<br>and a small part of the strength of your soul.</p>
  <p>Painting real people without pointless (some would say elitist) distortion is so important,<br>that each artist should ask their elder selves, "Which do you regret?"</p>

  <p>But, listen, this is just the beginning, all of this marvelous glory,<br>is but the first step into art, a world that has no limits or boundaries.</p>

  <p>For example here is one of the tiniest magic spells you can perform on your digital painting,<br>pick a neat and sunny color, and create a new top layer above your painting, and put it in Color Doge Mode...</p>
  <p>You now have the power of the sun, of fire, of glowing embers and god rays, of lens flare,<br>and streaking falling stars.</p>
  <p>The digital photo made it so that the gateways to worlds of fantasy,<br>and portraits depicting real faces lit by unimaginable beauty are but a click away.</p>

  <p>With Hyperrealism in hand,<br>the students enter the world of art as royalty.</p>
  <p>Teachers would have the student enter as a beggar,<br>cursed with the disease of broken hand and eye coordination.</p>
  <p>Forced into a lifetime of slightly crooked portraits,<br>and punished by placing all the beauty of art far and years away, under the lock and key.</p>

  <p>The hands of better generations,<br>hold pieces of magic so intricate, that a world must be <strong>built</strong>, prior, to it being painted.</p>
  <p>It can be photo bashing, which helps the artist learn from world's most experienced artists and movie directors,<br>it can be sculpture.</p>
  <p>We can already feel that sculpting in 2D by means of the constant use of a picker and local-color is missing something,<br>that something is the sculpture that comes along with the painting.</p>
  <p>It is beautifully printed, in marble PLA,<br>and serves as a companion to the painting.</p>
  <p>And it is not,<br>just about adding more powerful tools to the process.</p>
  <p>The future still includes oil on canvas,<br>some will paint their digital painting in a way that creates helpful reference for wall projectors.</p>
  <p>Physical world painters already use photography and digital art sketching,<br>to see where to take their painting next prior to laying down real paint on the canvas.</p>
  <p>In the future; canvas, and masterfully so,<br>becomes second to the digital masterpiece, here the process of painting is similar to the process of printing.</p>
  <p>The work of art must survive past the point of being laid down on the canvas,<br>a work of art deserves a change to evolve past its original limits.</p>

  <p>Every human being is born an Artist,<br>and Art is a Superpower - it will not be kept from us.</p>
  <p>One of the other incredible powers within our Psychology,<br>is thinking and reasoning, by subtle analogy.</p>
  <p>In the world beneath art, you are meant to grow all the way up as well,<br>you are, meant to become, a great being.</p>

  <p>Please,<br>stop memorizing - that is not how we learn for real.</p>
  <p>Your continued participation in fake education,<br>only makes things worse for the Little Ones.</p>
  <p>At the very least,<br>you are to clear the way for their growing up.</p>
  <p>Stop jumping through their hoops,<br>may your generation be known as the generation with the bad grades.</p>

  <p>Poverty whether you conceive it to be hunger,<br>or decades of servitude in return for the smallest possible paycheck that will keep you working.</p>
  <p>Is just the boogie man,<br>it takes three hops to begin making money on your own.</p>
  <p>Learn about something you like, practice and find inspiration in similar creations,<br>and search for an outlet where such things can be sold, and setup multiple such little undertakings.</p>
  <p>Businesses slow down at random,<br>if you have multiple ones you'll be safe.</p>
  <p>One year you'll make $20,000, another $200,000,<br>if you leave it alone it just goes up and down.</p>
  <p>If you continue learning,<br>the odds of not making money go down.</p>

  <p>This life long career nonsense that we have been spoon fed,<br>in this neutered state of education leads to an extremely unhealthy lifestyle.</p>
  <p>And ends with not having a job,<br>when you get much, much older.</p>
  <p>I always advise everyone to talk to their elder selves,<br>and ask them what their regrets are.</p>
  <p>I leave it up to them to choose the epoch they visit,<br>but I trust eventually they will visit their elderly selves.</p>
  <p>Fake education, hurts us across all our ages,<br>we need to plan for our entire life ahead.</p>
  <p>Whatever your career is,<br>they will eventually force you out, don't count on them.</p>
  <p>Retirement plans are just another carrot and stick,<br>trust me you do not want to live on that 69-cent canned hot dog at the dollar store.</p>
  <p>It is fine now,<br>but in your longest epoch, it is an insult.</p>

  <p>I am asking you to take to a Real Education<br>the beginning of which you will find in Narrated Books and Internet Video Tutorials.</p>
  <p>(That teachers desperately holding on to what they will later discover to be their fraudulent careers,<br>and schools always hungry for the dollar but denying food to children with debt whilst <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy971DCDlg">calling pizza a vegetable</a> as the parasites-i-mean principals get their golden parachutes,<br>have convinced you to be an ineffective and ridiculous form of education.)</p>
  <p>And narrated book after narrated book, and tutorial after tutorial,<br>awaken your genius.</p>
  <p>And ensure, that an no point in your life,<br>will you serve for money, nor go hungry, or grow grim.</p>

  <p>Genius is within you,<br>and once awakened, it will double with each new book and tutorial.</p>
  <p>Reject fake education,<br>learn in the sequence that fits you best, and at the pace that you find most comfortable.</p>
  <p>Help the Little Ones,<br>if you can.</p>
  <p>And remember,<br>with Knowledge comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes greatness.</p>

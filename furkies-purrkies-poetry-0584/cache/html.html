  <p>I am starting to think that Superhero belts,<br>are not as silly as they sound.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1053620613/batman-begins-dark-knight-utility-belt?ref=shop_home_recs_5&frs=1&sca=1">One seller on etsy made $657,900 dollars selling the Batman Begins / Dark Knight Utility Belt</a>,<br>which is for costumes only.</p>
  <p>My own design,<br>an extension of the wallet.</p>
  <p>Will be able to hold credit-cards,<br>phones, car remote, music player, and more.</p>
  <p>Not to mention the massive test of courage,<br>that walking around with what looks like a bat-belt represents.</p>
  <p>And what an adventure,<br>that could be?</p>

  <p>When was the list time someone asked you,<br>if those are real smoke bombs.</p>
  <p>And when was the last time that you actually went to the dollar store,<br>to pick up a couple of them?</p>
  <p>And Specifically,<br>because not only does your belt support them.</p>
  <p>But in deed actively encourages you to get some,<br>as it has a cute little compartment for them.</p>
  <p>Who cares that come July 4th,<br>unlike Batman you need to fiddle with a lighter to light them.</p>
  <p>And then they puff a baby-cloud of indeterminate color that even a ninja couldn't hide in,<br>a smoke bomb is a smoke bomb.</p>
  <p>And of course,<br>the little pocket doubles as a convenient neat little hiding place for candy.</p>
  <p>It supports anything between four Tootsie Rolls,<br>to a couple of Ferrero Rocher - with crunchy hazelnuts.</p>

  <p>Seriously though,<br>it is all only as foolish as you want it to be.</p>
  <p>People looking at your portfolio won't care if it is a superhero belt or a Raspberry Pi computer-case,<br>as this is a question of your creativity and accomplishment.</p>

  <p>(It is a very noble thing to set off to get a PhD,<br>to further science, to make a difference for people that need help and support in a hospital.</p>
  <p>But there is an easy way,<br>and a hard way.</p>
  <p>The easy way, is what the etsy seller is doing,<br>by the amount of money they made, they removed their stress of poverty.</p>
  <p>Schools are taking advantage of students by forcing them into debt,<br>we must encourage students to create, to learn independently alongside all the broken lectures and promises.)</p>

  <p>Even before finishing this text,<br>I already started testing Tactical Jewelry design.</p>
  <p>I am not yet quite sure what that is,<br>but I bet it is great for a portfolio and self defense, and certainly fascinating to look at.</p>
  <p>"Wow that is a very interesting bracelet you go there mam",<br>"it is actually all the components I need to swiftly assemble a dependable grappling hook - merely arranged to look like a fancy bracelet"</p>
  <p>"I often use it to escape boring conversations, and inquisitive people, like you,"</p>

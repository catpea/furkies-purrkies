  "text": "During my first and last internship,\na brainless CEO walked up to me and asked.\nWho do you want to be?\nwhat do you want to do.\nWhile I still had difficulty speaking,\nI could have answered.\nBut instead,\nI mumbled something about cutting paper.\n\nThe woman in control of the internship programme,\nsuspected that I knew perfect English.\nAnd me not communicating back with the CEO,\nwas all the evidence she needed.\nHalf way through High School,\na strange award ceremony appeared.\nKid sitting next to me laughed that he got an award,\nit was nice, but dishonest.\nYup, as you can guess,\nI was one of the few people that did not get an award.\nSometime before the ceremony I brainlessly read some Shakespeare,\nwhich I later dismissed, as it was not a good way to learn English.\nAnd I am with Mr. Vonnegut on the quality of Shakespeare's stories[1],\nI think he was capable of more.\nEven before that, I was asked to give my opinion on new teacher hires,\nI used the residual dictionary from the ongoing conversations in the room.\nEven I noticed how well I worded myself,\nbut in her eyes this did me no favors.\n\nI was right about the new teacher not being a good fit,\nbut deep down I wished her all the luck.\n\nSo the teacher wasn't aware of residual dictionaries,\nand relative ease communicating within a preset context.\nI was going to be taught a lesson by not receiving,\na fake award for fake progress.\n\nMy scrambled reply to the CEO was rooted in the way he treated me,\nthe truth was he didn't deserve a response.\nI was already familiar with DOS, GEOS[2], Mac OS, Windows 3, and maybe Win95,\nand could program a couple of flavors of BASIC.\nI was told not to enter the software library room,\nand my knowledge of commuters was ignored.\nI could

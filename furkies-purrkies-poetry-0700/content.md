Sometimes it feels like the whole world is against you,
and in a way that is true.

But when you don't know what to do,
let Mona Lisa Come to you.

Get a [Pen Tablet] and learn [GIMP], [Krita], [Inkscape], [Blender], and to use an [Ender],
speed thy slowly, and don't let the world force you to become a pretender.

If it seems like the adults don't care,
than that means the world need repair.

If things seem to be made of out plastic,
then the changes you need to made will be drastic.

If it quacks like a duck,
or if sometimes you hear a cluck.

---

It is a sign that the world got tangled and confused,
and the older you, will not be amused.

If High School seems fake,
then you need to study for real, for your own sake.

I know the grades are fake they always are,
and it goes all the way up to the General's star.

---

Please learn on your won, for real,
a real education is still a huge deal.

Start with Linux and Graphic Design,
and know that the future is something that you define.

Despite what you maybe told,
[Graphic Design is one of the most beautiful pursuits in the world][1].

---

It is not about working eight hours per day in High School,
you are meant to become a Great Being, not a tool.

It is not about a little paycheck every week,
that future __always__ looks bleak.

It is about you rising up, and up, to no end,
not about following the main trend.

---

Politics and school are confused,
because all the talking heads are bruised.

The adults are pretending,
they are __waiting__ for some kind of a meaningful ending.

But meaning is something that we each have to build,
it cannot be merely willed.

---

Your Wisdom, Art Skills and resulting [Business Startups][2] are a strong beginning,
they serve as a fine underpinning.

But then you have to continue growing,
and without ever slowing.

You have to grow all the way up and outgrow all the adults,
as that is the only way to get at the true results.

---

All the things that you can sense to be broken,
are a kind of a personal token.

As those are the things you must aim to repair,
to help those, who fall into the same despair.

Stop making compromises, and stop agreeing,
as you have been challenged to grow into a Great Being.

---

Though your future is an endless ocean,
all new beginnings start with a simple notion.

Let Mona Lisa guide you, as you copy and learn to paint just as well,
let it be the first step, to help you out of your shell.

But remember, do not follow, build your __own__ way to the top,
and when you get there, keep going and don't stop.

---

Let me say one more thing to you,
and I swear that this is true.

It is not about somebody else helping the world,
most people are just doing what they are told.

It __really matters__ what __you__ do,
because the world can't get better, without you.

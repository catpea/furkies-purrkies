  "text": "I finally heard that fancy long sound Cicadas make,\nI've been waiting forever.\nIn the years that I was settling down in New York,\nthey were up and about, and it was really nice to hear them again.\nIt has been a big day for my inventions as well,\nI've been able to minimize my mp3 player to a reasonable size.\nThough the smaller battery runs out in hours,\nnot days, but that is to be expected.\n\nI have to tidy up some software,\nI have to re-write monitoring of Bluetooth devices...\nBecause the files that represent them on Linux,\nare actually deleted when the Bluetooth device goes to sleep.\nSo I have to close the file-handle,\nand go back into waiting for input device mode, which I recently coded-in[1]\nIt all just takes,\n3 lines of code,\n\nAt the gym,\nI realized that all my songs have to come in three speeds[2].\n140 beats per minute for lateral footwork,\nwhere I twist my feet left and right, which isn't as fast as classical dance moves.\n150 beats per minute,\nwhich should be my standard 2.5 hour workout.\n(But isn't as I halved my workout time,\ndue to the Pandemic.)\nAnd then the upper speed of 160 beats,\nwhich is for dancing without dumbbells.\nI am still working on my posture, so right now the little dumbbells,\nand the mask, are making breathing more difficult.\nI wanted to spend this year mostly on cardio,\nand my goodness...\nJust couple of weeks ago, I had to look back on my bicycle,\nto check for traffic...\nAnd instead of getting a 120 degree view,\nI caught 190 degree in the corner of my eye, so cardio is working out for me.\nI just tried it again standing up, with my feet pointed forward,\nI can see 190 degrees behind me by turning my knees torso, upper body and head - this can't be normal.\nBut, my music player, you see, is capable of manipulating the speed of music,\ngiving me rest, proper workout or high speed workout.\nThis is not a computation performed live,\nthe little Raspberry Pi computer can't handle that.\nBut a desktop computer can process 100 songs,\nprobably in 20 minutes.\n\nWhich brings me to my song composition,\nthis is another thing that I figured out today.\nI am able to enrich the background of the songs I compose,\nby actually adding standard sea-like noise, and then adding some reverb, and filtering it down a little bit.\nThis is very strange for me, I expected that background noise is best created with blended drums, base guitar,\nbut standard wet noise works very well.\nI first noticed use of noise in a re-make of Alan Walkers Faded, it is refereed to as uplifter and downlifter[3],\nand though those samples are richer and actually fade-in/fade-away, as far as my lightweight EDM goes, noise is noise.\nI made a sample project, not really a song,\nthat show how the noise fills-in the background, I play that now;\n(SAMPLE PLAYS)\n\nI left my favorite discovery, and milestone for last,\nbecause as small as my Raspberry PI mp3 player is.\nIt needs a purpose made case that can house the smaller battery,\nthat will take under account all the ports and a customizable push button that comes with the battery module.\nWhich in the current Mark-II prototype serves as the play and shuffle button,\ndouble press being a stop button, and long press being a sleep button.\nThis is nothing I can create out of a stock Aluminum Project Box/Enclosure[4],\nand while this takes me to the 3D printed cased realms.\nThe first thing that comes to my mind is a CNC milling machine,\nI am just crazy about aluminum, and how it dissipates heat, and how it looks.\nBut this is something that is many months away,\nas first I need to learn how to use Open Source CNC software.\nI just want to see simulated tool-paths on my screen,\nI already have an SVG model of a case, there are many online[5] - but I know a huge tangent when I see one.\nSo I have built my MP3 player invention, I even went from Car Player to Workout Player,\nbut I got stopped by the world of 3D printers and CNC milling machines, as that is a whole new adventure, for another year.\n\nIt is great though,\nI went to the local hardware store today.\nI held Aluminum stock in my hands,\nI searched for a nibbling tool, sheet metal tools...\nI traced the micro-usb ports of an existing case I have,\nI stared intently at my Dremel tool.\n\nTo me all of this represents another semester of self education,\nthere are dozens of new things to learn here.\nIt is how it has always worked for me,\nfinish the little MP3 player and a great new world of CNC milling and 3D printing opens its gateways.\nIt is really hard to start watching lectures or tutorials about programming CNC machinery,\nuntil there is that need, to finish a little project.\n\nThere is no education like self education, it is never about finishing some one thing,\nbut about all the branching things that we visit learn, along the way.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://github.com/catpea/isir/blob/bd355ff8af700836463c4c524cf4a36e50da7c10/device.js#L29\n[2]: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#atempo\n[3]: https://splice.com/Pro-Alemaker/alan-walker---faded-full-remake\n[4]: https://www.amazon.com/aluminum-project-box/s?k=aluminum+project+box\n[5]: https://all3dp.com/2/raspberry-pi-zero-case-3d-print-update/",

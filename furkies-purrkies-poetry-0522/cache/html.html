  <p>I finally heard that fancy long sound Cicadas make,<br>I've been waiting forever.</p>
  <p>In the years that I was settling down in New York,<br>they were up and about, and it was really nice to hear them again.</p>
  <p>It has been a big day for my inventions as well,<br>I've been able to minimize my mp3 player to a reasonable size.</p>
  <p>Though the smaller battery runs out in hours,<br>not days, but that is to be expected.</p>

  <p>I have to tidy up some software,<br>I have to re-write monitoring of Bluetooth devices...</p>
  <p>Because the files that represent them on Linux,<br>are actually deleted when the Bluetooth device goes to sleep.</p>
  <p>So I have to close the file-handle,<br>and go back into <a href="https://github.com/catpea/isir/blob/bd355ff8af700836463c4c524cf4a36e50da7c10/device.js#L29">waiting for input device mode, which I recently coded-in</a></p>
  <p>It all just takes,<br>3 lines of code,</p>

  <p>At the gym,<br>I realized that <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#atempo">all my songs have to come in three speeds</a>.</p>
  <p>140 beats per minute for lateral footwork,<br>where I twist my feet left and right, which isn't as fast as classical dance moves.</p>
  <p>150 beats per minute,<br>which should be my standard 2.5 hour workout.</p>
  <p>(But isn't as I halved my workout time,<br>due to the Pandemic.)</p>
  <p>And then the upper speed of 160 beats,<br>which is for dancing without dumbbells.</p>
  <p>I am still working on my posture, so right now the little dumbbells,<br>and the mask, are making breathing more difficult.</p>
  <p>I wanted to spend this year mostly on cardio,<br>and my goodness...</p>
  <p>Just couple of weeks ago, I had to look back on my bicycle,<br>to check for traffic...</p>
  <p>And instead of getting a 120 degree view,<br>I caught 190 degree in the corner of my eye, so cardio is working out for me.</p>
  <p>I just tried it again standing up, with my feet pointed forward,<br>I can see 190 degrees behind me by turning my knees torso, upper body and head - this can't be normal.</p>
  <p>But, my music player, you see, is capable of manipulating the speed of music,<br>giving me rest, proper workout or high speed workout.</p>
  <p>This is not a computation performed live,<br>the little Raspberry Pi computer can't handle that.</p>
  <p>But a desktop computer can process 100 songs,<br>probably in 20 minutes.</p>

  <p>Which brings me to my song composition,<br>this is another thing that I figured out today.</p>
  <p>I am able to enrich the background of the songs I compose,<br>by actually adding standard sea-like noise, and then adding some reverb, and filtering it down a little bit.</p>
  <p>This is very strange for me, I expected that background noise is best created with blended drums, base guitar,<br>but standard wet noise works very well.</p>
  <p><a href="https://splice.com/Pro-Alemaker/alan-walker---faded-full-remake">I first noticed use of noise in a re-make of Alan Walkers Faded, it is refereed to as uplifter and downlifter</a>,<br>and though those samples are richer and actually fade-in/fade-away, as far as my lightweight EDM goes, noise is noise.</p>
  <p>I made a sample project, not really a song,<br>that show how the noise fills-in the background, I play that now;</p>

  <p>I left my favorite discovery, and milestone for last,<br>because as small as my Raspberry PI mp3 player is.</p>
  <p>It needs a purpose made case that can house the smaller battery,<br>that will take under account all the ports and a customizable push button that comes with the battery module.</p>
  <p>Which in the current Mark-II prototype serves as the play and shuffle button,<br>double press being a stop button, and long press being a sleep button.</p>
  <p>This is nothing I can create out of a stock <a href="https://www.amazon.com/aluminum-project-box/s?k=aluminum+project+box">Aluminum Project Box/Enclosure</a>,<br>and while this takes me to the 3D printed cased realms.</p>
  <p>The first thing that comes to my mind is a CNC milling machine,<br>I am just crazy about aluminum, and how it dissipates heat, and how it looks.</p>
  <p>But this is something that is many months away,<br>as first I need to learn how to use Open Source CNC software.</p>
  <p>I just want to see simulated tool-paths on my screen,<br><a href="https://all3dp.com/2/raspberry-pi-zero-case-3d-print-update/">I already have an SVG model of a case, there are many online</a> - but I know a huge tangent when I see one.</p>
  <p>So I have built my MP3 player invention, I even went from Car Player to Workout Player,<br>but I got stopped by the world of 3D printers and CNC milling machines, as that is a whole new adventure, for another year.</p>

  <p>It is great though,<br>I went to the local hardware store today.</p>
  <p>I held Aluminum stock in my hands,<br>I searched for a nibbling tool, sheet metal tools...</p>
  <p>I traced the micro-usb ports of an existing case I have,<br>I stared intently at my Dremel tool.</p>

  <p>To me all of this represents another semester of self education,<br>there are dozens of new things to learn here.</p>
  <p>It is how it has always worked for me,<br>finish the little MP3 player and a great new world of CNC milling and 3D printing opens its gateways.</p>
  <p>It is really hard to start watching lectures or tutorials about programming CNC machinery,<br>until there is that need, to finish a little project.</p>

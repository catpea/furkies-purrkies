The culture of growing up is not optional,
that is why adventures that pose challenges-to-be-overcome are so helpful.

That is why [inheriting lifetimes of wise beings from books and poems is so useful][1],
we need wisdom to grow, and we need it to become free from stupid cultures that can only crush us.

We have to become great beings,
it will keep us strong and healthy, and full of joy and understanding.

---

Wisdom must be the standard of measurement,
not who you think you are, or where you were born, or how they hurt you.

Our life is such a beautiful thing,
and we are meant to rise all the way up, ALL THE WAY UP.

We may not stay down, or childlike, or confused,
because time does not stay down.

---

We rise, we must grow to become Great Beings,
we rise tall enough to move mountains.

To spread wisdom,
to share inspiration.

To show Humanity,
and to hold highly, even the most foolish curiosities that make us smile.

---

We do not belong in prisons with invisible walls,
we belong where we can breathe ocean air.

We belong, on paths of pine trees,
and lakes of endless Summers.

The horizon must keep us company just as the moon and the stars,
as it will remind us, how distant our beautiful journey.

---

Those of us who do give-up on dreams,
won't be able to advance, and grow, and heal, we can't allow this.

We must advance,
we must not be left behind.

Life,
is too beautiful, too precious.

---

Wisdom, too important,
not to share.

And youth,
so impossible, so full of energy.

Wake up everyone, make your way towards wisdom,
you are meant to become Great Beings.

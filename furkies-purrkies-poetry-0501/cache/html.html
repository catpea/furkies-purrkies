  <p>The culture of growing up is not optional,<br>that is why adventures that pose challenges-to-be-overcome are so helpful.</p>
  <p>That is why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6_QUhUPrF4">inheriting lifetimes of wise beings from books and poems is so useful</a>,<br>we need wisdom to grow, and we need it to become free from stupid cultures that can only crush us.</p>
  <p>We have to become great beings,<br>it will keep us strong and healthy, and full of joy and understanding.</p>

  <p>Wisdom must be the standard of measurement,<br>not who you think you are, or where you were born, or how they hurt you.</p>
  <p>Our life is such a beautiful thing,<br>and we are meant to rise all the way up, ALL THE WAY UP.</p>
  <p>We may not stay down, or childlike, or confused,<br>because time does not stay down.</p>

  <p>We rise, we must grow to become Great Beings,<br>we rise tall enough to move mountains.</p>
  <p>To spread wisdom,<br>to share inspiration.</p>
  <p>To show Humanity,<br>and to hold highly, even the most foolish curiosities that make us smile.</p>

  <p>We do not belong in prisons with invisible walls,<br>we belong where we can breathe ocean air.</p>

  <p>The horizon must keep us company just as the moon and the stars,<br>as it will remind us, how distant our beautiful journey.</p>

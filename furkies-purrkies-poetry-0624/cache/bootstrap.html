    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I have noticed that low pitched sounds are rare,<br>and high pitched sounds more frequent.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In a musical composition Bass Drums,<br>are a lot less frequent than cymbals.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think this observation can be very valuable,<br>to people that just started learning music.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you can get to the Beat+BassLine Editor in lmms,<br>you can start composing instantly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Put the drums on every beat,<br>or maybe every other beat....</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then whatever sounds higher,<br>make it more frequent.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I'll use the metronome to let you hear the beat,<br>at 140bpm.</div>

  <p>I have noticed that low pitched sounds are rare,<br>and high pitched sounds more frequent.</p>
  <p>In a musical composition Bass Drums,<br>are a lot less frequent than cymbals.</p>
  <p>I think this observation can be very valuable,<br>to people that just started learning music.</p>
  <p>If you can get to the Beat+BassLine Editor in lmms,<br>you can start composing instantly.</p>
  <p>Put the drums on every beat,<br>or maybe every other beat....</p>
  <p>And then whatever sounds higher,<br>make it more frequent.</p>

  <p>There is one very very very tiny complication here,<br>we will immediately add variation.</p>
  <p>Find the clone steps button,<br>in the upper right corner of the Beat+BassLine Editor and hit it.</p>
  <p>Now the patter you created will have twice the length,<br>so mess up the second part a very very very tiny bit.</p>

  <p>Allow me to demonstrate,<br>Normally, lmms starts in 140 beats per minute.</p>
  <p>I'll use the metronome to let you hear the beat,<br>at 140bpm.</p>
  <p>(metronome plays)</p>
  <p>Now let me put a drum on every other beat,<br>I'll keep the metronome on.</p>
  <p>(drum1 plays)</p>
  <p>Now, allow me to turn off the metronome,<br>so you can hear what every other beat sounds like without interference.</p>
  <p>(drum2 plays)</p>
  <p>If you were to measure beats of this sample,<br><a href="https://www.beatsperminuteonline.com/">your tool would report 70 beats per minute, since we are skipping every other beat</a>.</p>
  <p>Now let us put in a second drum,<br>filling in those empty beats, this will register as 140bpm now.</p>
  <p>(drum3 plays)</p>
  <p>At this point you can hear how this has no motion or dance,<br>it seems very square, very mechanical.</p>
  <p>So, already we will perform that,<br>very very very tiny complication here.</p>
  <p>Where we double things up,<br>and introduce gentle variation in the second part.</p>
  <p>(drum4 plays)</p>
  <p>You see how neat it sounds,<br>let me redo this one more time, to show you variation on the other drum.</p>
  <p>(drum5 plays)</p>

  <p>Even though we are just doing two boring drums,<br>by adding that one variation...</p>
  <p>Which is just an extra hit on the drum,<br>we get a melody going.</p>
  <p>By just hitting the drum one extra time,<br>we get a melody, out of nowhere.</p>
  <p>I really hope you don't mind me adding that variation,<br>it is just a beautiful thing.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>So what we have now is the low pitch sound,<br>or low frequency sound, or bass.</p>
  <p>Basically hitting on every beat,<br>not counting the little variation, which hits the drum twice in a beat.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>Now we will add a medium pitched sound,<br>that hits more often then the drum.</p>
  <p>(mid1 plays)</p>
  <p>Now let us add a second medium pitched sound,<br>to introduce more variation.</p>
  <p>(mid2 plays)</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And now we will add some high pitched sounds,<br>clicks and sticks and the like.</p>
  <p>These will hit at a very high rate,<br>which means we should break-up repetition more frequently.</p>
  <p>So we will very the pattern twice or thrice,<br>or whatever sounds good.</p>
  <p>Let us give that a listen,<br>and I made this section slightly longer as it sounds nice.</p>

  <p>In closing I would like to show you one more trick,<br>here we have to go to FX Mixer, click Master, Add Effect, and add Plate 2x2 versatile plate re-verb.</p>
  <p>Reverb effects are magical, as they take a dry sound,<br>and give them wet thickness.</p>
  <p>I will replay the previous melody,<br>but this time slowly turn up reverb by the time we reach the middle of the piece.</p>

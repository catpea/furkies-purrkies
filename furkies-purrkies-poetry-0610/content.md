I immediately made New York my home,
I even took the subway to the Far Rockaway Beach a couple of times.

I felt most comfortable sitting quietly on Brooklyn Bridge,
with lady liberty as my company.

There was an old broken down bench,
on the Manhattan side, that I made my own.

Later, just before I left for Michigan,
I discovered where the bridge starts on Brooklyn side.

I never crossed it,
I just like sitting on it.

---

I didn't have too much to say to Lady Liberty,
it was very peaceful on the bridge - I called it my temple of solitude.

I went there so often,
that eventually I got caught in the rain.

It wasn't a big rain,
but it wasn't anything to ignore either.

I had a long coat on,
and by the time I waddled back to the subway station.

It was like wearing wet towel,
I was dripping in the subway car and there was nothing I could do.

---

The person next to me actually smiled,
realizing that I am making a puddle, without making a fuss.

I like getting caught in the rain,
as much as I like my little adventures.

---

Before long I was back on the bench,
with candy in my pocket.

The river was flowing to the sea,
Manhattan skyscrapers stood majestic to my right.

There were ships passing beneath me back and forth,
and cars going left and right just below the area I was sitting on.

Out in the distance toward the right,
stood the quiet Lady Liberty.

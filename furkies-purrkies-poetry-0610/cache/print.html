  <div class="paragraph">I immediately made New York my home,<br>I even took the subway to the Far Rockaway Beach a couple of times.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I felt most comfortable sitting quietly on Brooklyn Bridge,<br>with lady liberty as my company.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There was an old broken down bench,<br>on the Manhattan side, that I made my own.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Later, just before I left for Michigan,<br>I discovered where the bridge starts on Brooklyn side.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I never crossed it,<br>I just like sitting on it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">I didn't have too much to say to Lady Liberty,<br>it was very peaceful on the bridge - I called it my temple of solitude.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I went there so often,<br>that eventually I got caught in the rain.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It wasn't a big rain,<br>but it wasn't anything to ignore either.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I had a long coat on,<br>and by the time I waddled back to the subway station.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It was like wearing wet towel,<br>I was dripping in the subway car and there was nothing I could do.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The person next to me actually smiled,<br>realizing that I am making a puddle, without making a fuss.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I like getting caught in the rain,<br>as much as I like my little adventures.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Before long I was back on the bench,<br>with candy in my pocket.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The river was flowing to the sea,<br>Manhattan skyscrapers stood majestic to my right.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">There were ships passing beneath me back and forth,<br>and cars going left and right just below the area I was sitting on.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Out in the distance toward the right,<br>stood the quiet Lady Liberty.</div>

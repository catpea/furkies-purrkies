    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There was an old broken down bench,<br>on the Manhattan side, that I made my own.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Later, just before I left for Michigan,<br>I discovered where the bridge starts on Brooklyn side.</div>

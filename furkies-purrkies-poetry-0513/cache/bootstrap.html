    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was sure that it was an enormous mutated rat,<br>it was on the other side of the road, and I was worried that it would go after me.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They are the size of a small mini-horse,<br>and that can be terrifying, at first.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But they are very sweet,<br>and good for the neighborhood, they are a blessing as they eat tics, like a lot of them.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It took many years to encounter a skunk as well,<br>but as you can imagine, I was able to smell them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">By the time I finally met one in person,<br>it was right next to me.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It was on his way,<br>going about his business, completely unafraid.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The same can't be said for me,<br>by now I've lost count how many hot flashes I experienced in my life.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When you find yourself next to a wild animal,<br>the last thing you want to do is run away, as it may squirt after you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">From the stories I've heard,<br>no one really recovers from the squirt of a skunk, that smell stays with the victim for life.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I know that this is no big deal for people born in America,<br>but most of what I knew where I came from, were Well Traveled Pigeons, Fancy Squirrels, and Cute Sparrows.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And Storks, I don't even mention them,<br>as I basically grew up among them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There were Deer, Wild Boar, Rabbits,<br>and Horses, Cows, Chickens.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But animals in America are different somehow,<br>they seem more intelligent.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I did actually run into a creature that is rare,<br>and it was a very large porcupine.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was on my way to the local store,<br>and it crossed the road, this was in the middle of the woods.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though I didn't want to frighten it, I really wanted to take a closer look,<br>but all I got was a blurry photo as she hurried along her way.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Black bears don't run up to attack,<br>they just challenge people who are in their way, if you stand your ground they'll move along.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They seem to be just big raccoon,<br>brown bears are the scary ones.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I have had several close Raccoon encounters,<br>and they never cease to surprise.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once at <a href="https://thedyrt.com/camping/michigan/jackpine-hike-in-campground">Jackpine Hike-In Campgrounds</a> I woke up 4AM,<br>to a Raccoon , that I later named Friday, gently pulling out hot dog buns from my food pack.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I did hang it up in the tree to be careful,<br>and it was in a zipped backpack, but there was a hole where the straps ran, and he found it, the little thief.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even since, I have started dangling my food from a branch on a rope,<br>that seems to present a proper challenge for them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Over at <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hmnf/recarea/?recid=18770">Nordhouse</a> I only ever encountered one Raccoon snooping around my tent,<br>this was some ways from the lake.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I am always very careful, to zip my tent before I go on a walk, or in this case a swim,<br>but this amazing brainic, unzipped my tent.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It went inside and left paw prints on my pillow,<br>I have not used my inflatable pillow since.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In closing, I offer this advice to all adventurers,<br>bears or no bears don't keep food anywhere near your tent,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And get a little luggage lock,<br>to lock the two zipper-pulls together when you go for a walkabout.</div>

I remember the first time I saw a possum,
I was in US for a few years, but I' haven't seen one until I was in my mid 20's.
I was sure that it was an enormous mutated rat,
it was on the other side of the road, and I was worried that it would go after me.
They are the size of a small mini-horse,
and that can be terrifying, at first.
But they are very sweet,
and good for the neighborhood, they are a blessing as they eat tics, like a lot of them.

It took many years to encounter a skunk as well,
but as you can imagine, I was able to smell them.
By the time I finally met one in person,
it was right next to me.
It was on his way,
going about his business, completely unafraid.
The same can't be said for me,
by now I've lost count how many hot flashes I experienced in my life.
When you find yourself next to a wild animal,
the last thing you want to do is run away, as it may squirt after you.
From the stories I've heard,
no one really recovers from the squirt of a skunk, that smell stays with the victim for life.

I know that this is no big deal for people born in America,
but most of what I knew where I came from, were Well Traveled Pigeons, Fancy Squirrels, and Cute Sparrows.
And Storks, I don't even mention them,
as I basically grew up among them.
There were Deer, Wild Boar, Rabbits,
and Horses, Cows, Chickens.
But animals in America are different somehow,
they seem more intelligent.

Aside from a terrible owl encounter,
and an equally terrible poem[1].
I did actually run into a creature that is rare,
and it was a very large porcupine.
I was on my way to the local store,
and it crossed the road, this was in the middle of the woods.
Though I didn't want to frighten it, I really wanted to take a closer look,
but all I got was a blurry photo as she hurried along her way.
Even though I didn't get a very good look,
the encounter seemed pretty magical.

I later found out that Black Bears were being introduced, back into that area of the woods[2],
but from what I understand they pretty much keep to themselves, unless they are trying to be cute.
Black bears don't run up to attack,
they just challenge people who are in their way, if you stand your ground they'll move along.
They seem to be just big raccoon,
brown bears are the scary ones.

I have had several close Raccoon encounters,
and they never cease to surprise.
Once at Jackpine Hike-In Campgrounds[3] I woke up 4AM,
to a Raccoon , that I later named Friday, gently pulling out hot dog buns from my food pack.
I did hang it up in the tree to be careful,
and it was in a zipped backpack, but there was a hole where the straps ran, and he found it, the little thief.
Even since, I have started dangling my food from a branch on a rope,
that seems to present a proper challenge for them.
Over at Nordhouse[4] I only ever encountered one Raccoon snooping around my tent,
this was some ways from the lake.
I am always very careful, to zip my tent before I go on a walk, or in this case a swim,
but this amazing brainic, unzipped my tent.
It went inside and left paw prints on my pillow,
I have not used my inflatable pillow since.
In closing, I offer this advice to all adventurers,
bears or no bears don't keep food anywhere near your tent,
And get a little luggage lock,
to lock the two zipper-pulls together when you go for a walkabout.

  <p>Somehow wisdom got replaced with Movies, Drama, and Music,<br>Local Culture, Family Culture, and School.</p>
  <p>We may see strong personalities,<br>but there is little coherence here.</p>
  <p>We witness,<br>contradictions, limitations.</p>
  <p>Humanity's aim is to converge on Wisdom,<br>leaving all the bad ideas behind.</p>
  <p>If you get yelled at, controlled,<br>or punched by a bully, you don't punch back, or get mad.</p>
  <p>You push it all away, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf_ajrfTrp8">swipe and examine</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Ebp7IsPW4">know the birth of the universe</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZpsVSVRsZk">know your ancestors</a>.</p>
  <p>Study knowledge, make your way towards wisdom,<br>and know that the meaning of life is found in Greatness.</p>

  "text": "To learn something you must hunger for it,\nto learn something, you must love it.\n\nTo learn something, you must enjoy it so much, that you will put it aside,\nand learn the stuff beneath it first, to grant yourself a fair chance at mastery.\n\nEvery little bit counts,\nbut only if it comes in a sequence that fits what you have already learned.\n\nIf you attempt to learn things out of sequence,\nor worse yet, trust someone to teach you,\nit won't work, it never has, it never will, forget it.\n\nAnd it is not just sequence,\nit is also the speed at which you learn, that must be taken under consideration.\n\nSequence and Pace,\nnow that is just the barbarian level of learning, meant for warriors.\n\nYou, can do better than that,\nyou certainly should.\n\nWhen you learn is important,\nnight owls will learn at a different time of day than others.\n\nIt is the environment that matters,\nsome people can't learn in a city and will needs trees and mountains.\n\nAnd, the geographic location matters too, if you love numbers, and calculus calls to you,\nvisit Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz at Neustädter Kirche in Hanover Germany,\nvisit Sir Isaac Newton at Westminster Abbey in London, England.\n\nAnd remember, Sciences are learned not by memorizing facts,\nbut by tracing their development across the ages.\n\nSchools are here to teach us,\nbut they don't know how.\n\nWhat they do know,\nis how to fake it,\nand make it appear like you are learning.\n\nThe motive is simple,\nfor as long as the school gets funding,\neveryone gets to keep their job.\n\nYes,\nit is fraud.\n\nYes, they are selling your mind for a small paycheck,\nthe curriculum is impossible to learn from.\n\nCurriculum is stitched out of questions that you will have to pass later on,\nso that the school can continue to operate, they just want you to retain most of it,\nand they will expect you to cram before that test too.\n\nIf you want to become a Doctor, Scientist, Mathematician,\nyou need to be going to a real school, that will encourage you to learn in optimal ways,\na public school is not the optimal setting for education.\n\nA public school is primary for babysitting,\nso that you're not home alone trying to set your or the sticky bandits hair on fire.\n\nIn order for that school to exist,\nteachers need to get paid,\nso you need to pretend to learn by just memorizing,\nand passing tests, your grades help the school continue to operate.\n\nNobody cares if you are learning,\nor memorizing.\n\nTo graduate with a good GPA, you will have to memorize,\nand it will be disconnected facts, they will be out of sequence,\nthey cannot possibly fit what you already know, and you will forget it all.\n\nIn return for hoop jumping you will get a diploma,\nand will be accepted to college or university if you cram for the SAT and entrance exams.\n\nIn college, your education will be slowed down,\nit will be called, balanced education, and they will say it with a straight face like a cult member.\n\nThe text books will be $300, lectures $500,\nand you can apply for Medical School from here, and move on.\n\nIt is hinted that Panama Papers are a good example of what is going on,\nthere is no central organization that encourages corruption,\nit is just that everyone is looking for a shortcut.\n\nYou can stand up in class,\nbut everyone jobs are at stake.\n\nYou will be accused of disrupting the class,\nand you will be suspended.\n\nThey will stress you out,\nthey will make you tired,\nthey will make you drop out.\n\nLet me just say,\nthat you are not allowed to stand by when someone is getting hurt.\n\nIf the teacher or security are acting creepy,\ntalk to the principal, explain that the second time it happens, you will call the police.\n\nThe teachers, in their haste will give up on the students in the back,\nthey have fallen behind on material, but now they are being made to feel that they are unintelligent,\nthis will destroy their minds, this will cause great harm to their self esteem,\nthey need your help, get them audio books, Bill Bryson and Carl Sagan.\n\nI think most teachers, when pressured,\nwill tell you that you are expected to learn on your own,\nand in effect confess, that they are useless, when it comes to teaching you for real.\n\nThat the classroom is about standardized testing,\nfor which it is easier to force you to memorize disconnected bits of knowledge that you will soon forget,\nthen to actually craft a curriculum that will fit all the students,\nand match their existing knowledge,\nand the natural pace at which they learn,\nand their personality.\n\nIt used to be true that a single teacher cannot approach all their students in a way that will help them learn,\nso to stay in business, they would force them into memorization.\n\nBut today, that is not the case. Today, the only reason why the old ways are still in place,\nis because low quality schools are continuing to try to stay in business - this is evil.\n\nToday, with the help of computers, smart phones and tablets,\ninteractive/open curricula, online lectures, Audio Books, and internet,\nit is possible to approach each student individually,\nI am sure there are online schools that are trying to do just that.\n\nThere is no excuse for why anybody should have less than an A, or a 4.0 GPA,\nthat is what being in school is about, learning, and when you have learned, you get an A.\n\nEven now, I can't see everything that has gone wrong,\nschools have become a bit less unforgiving, I am sure.\n\nBut even so, the fact remains,\ntoday schools can't teach.\n\nThey are wicked good,\nat tricking students into thinking that they are not smart enough for good grades.\n\nAt the end of the day,\nyou will still need an education.\n\nYour only safe bet,\nis becoming self taught,\nindependent study.\n\nAnd please, don't let anybody call you a Genius,\nhelp others, help them find knowledge too.\n\nFinally,\nI describe this tragedy to the best of my abilities,\non a tired mind, some things have slipped, others are out of shape, please forgive me.\n\nBut, I do know one thing for certain,\nthis is not a standing tragedy that will remain forever.\n\nThis is a call for heroism,\nfor courage, and courage calls to courage everywhere.\n\nThis is how Life asks for help,\nyou are now being challenged to stand up to mediocrity, to lies.\n\nBecome a Great Being,\nFix Schools.\n\nPersonal note,\n\nHere is a short list of my favorite science popularizes.\n\nBill Bryson\nRichard Dawkins\nSam Harris\nPZ Myers\nLawrence Krauss\nLord Martin Rees\nJill Tarter\nSeth Shostak\nAlex Filippenko\nSean Carroll\nJared Diamond\nHoward Zinn\n\n\n[Panama Papers]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers\n[you will still need an education]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGoZZvfEd6A",

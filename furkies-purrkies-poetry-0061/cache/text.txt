If you don't care about yourself,
People will get scared of you.

Because, if you get hurt,
you will hurt them too.

You have to watch yourself,
be compassionate to yourself.

Ask...

Is working too many hours a day,
helping or harming me?

Are Office Walls,
helping or harming me?

Does loneliness help you?
Or does it harm you?

Same for getting scared,
Does hiding really help you?

Overwork and Office is unhealthy,
take those skills, and build.

Take it outside,
let Nature nurture you.

In her silence,
she will help you remember who you are.

You must learn to treat your body with compassion,

You must learn to take Great Care of our mind.

And please,
make every day count.

We are so beautiful,
such powerful dreamers.

Above All,
Love Yourself.

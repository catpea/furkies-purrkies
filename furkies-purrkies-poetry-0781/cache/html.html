  <p>You must use photo reference, at least at first, or you will get stuck,<br>our brains use some extra processing for faces.</p>
  <p>You can’t just copy a face on a canvas,<br>because you are not seeing the person correctly.</p>
  <p>Similar thing happens with the moon when it grows large,<br>the moon never comes closer to earth, it is always the same size...</p>
  <p>Our brain is just doing extra processing,<br>or not processing things at the horizon correctly, if you like.</p>

  <p>The difference between looking into distance,<br>and looking afraid.</p>
  <p>Can be as little,<br>as showing a thin white line beneath the iris.</p>
  <p>You won’t be able to see that,<br>not very easily.</p>
  <p>You do not want to play,<br>find all the differences in the two images during your painting.</p>
  <p>You may not even be able to find,<br>that it is that bit of white beneath the iris that’s changing he entire expression.</p>
  <p>Or that the lower eyelid must be rosier,<br>and area beneath the eye needs blue...</p>
  <p>Or, you are going to hit the uncanny valley hard,<br>you do not want the brain to say "This human is not real" - or worse, yikes.</p>

  <p>There are people out there who draw freehand,<br>some dare try to paint live subjects.</p>
  <p>And that is a kind of a trick,<br>they relay on the fact that nobody will tell the artist: “This does not look like me.”</p>
  <p>So it is like being hypnotized in front of an audience,<br>during a live show.</p>
  <p>Everybody, ends up pretending they got hypnotized,<br>if hypnosis was actually real...</p>
  <p>All the cops in the world,<br>would be trying to hypnotize their perps to get them to talk.</p>
  <p>“Sir, I need you to put your hands behind your back,<br>and look deeply into my purdy eyes.”</p>

  <p>The folks who draw fantasy art,<br>just letting faces come together as they practice their skills with reference in hand...</p>
  <p>Are not painting real people,<br>all that often.</p>
  <p>Some do it, and holly molly it is extraordinary,<br>when it works.</p>
  <p>Today they are the little known leaders of modern art,<br>history will certainly remember them.</p>
  <p>So you can’t just look at a breathtaking stylized painting,<br>and feel discouraged that it would take you four days to do it.</p>
  <p>The artist might have been training on a pretty image for days,<br>but it is unlikely that you could pick the person in the painting from a lineup of similar looking people.</p>

  <p>Realism done right, is the kind of art,<br>that once seen by the person in the painting...</p>
  <p>It induces the urge,<br>to put palms of their hands on their temples...</p>
  <p>And hold their head like that while smiling in fascination,<br>for a goodie-long while.</p>
  <p>Afterword; and this is my private opinion,<br>but I suspect that here is a naming problem - a subtle distinction that has been missed.</p>
  <p>Photorealism is closely connected to painting photographs,<br><a href="https://www.hyperrealism.eu/painters/?subject=portrait">Hyperrealism is a bit more artistic, more hyper</a>, but there is more.</p>
  <p>And I call it Super Realism,<br>unfortunately the world maybe calling it semi-realism, and that is just ridiculous.</p>
  <p>Super Realism is is not just artistic,<br>but it beautifies and enhances human features.</p>
  <p>Semi-realism will just enlarge eyes and perhaps make them fantasy based,<br>but <a href="https://www.artstation.com/nadar">Super Realism will enhance human features without unnecessary distortion</a>.</p>

Life is always about learning and knowing,
all those winds of change freely blowing.

But there is something you must always remember,
that you are a Raging Fire not a glowing ember.

It is your right to strive and thrive and grow,
may you melt all the sleeping-and-cold snow.

Let there fill new oceans, let the rivers flow,
and may the sun shine forever with your beautiful glow.

We each should live our lives with a huge thunder,
because no matter the tests life is always a wonder.

But the best things come from us beating life's test,
by rising up, becoming wise, and doing our best.

No challenge is ever as easy as it looks,
it all requires reading plenty of books.

I don't think anybody is ever truly blessed,
I think life may push us all to feel stressed.

But we are each so special and so strong, and so sweet,
that we can all take on the challenge, and handle the heat.

All the things we hold tight to the breast,
always come from some hard challenge or quest.

It is all about learning and taking that harder route,
so that each day we grow-more in wisdom and less in doubt.

So please, always strive to do your best,
so that the 90 year old you can get some good night's rest.

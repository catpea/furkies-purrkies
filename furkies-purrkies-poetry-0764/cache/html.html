  <p>Art is sensitive to light and color as well,<br>painting on a well calibrated monitor...</p>
  <p>Can look slightly off,<br>on a coffee shop laptop.</p>
  <p>And when you take your art,<br>to the local photo printing booth...</p>
  <p>You may find that the shadows in the painting do not agree,<br>with all rooms you take your art into.</p>

  <p>Moreover, unlike a photo your impressionist painting,<br>can ask you for help.</p>
  <p>It speaks in strange ways,<br>but it speaks with heart.</p>

  <p>And that is only the half of it,<br>because you speak back.</p>

  <p>Sometimes you add to much,<br>and the painting will tell you so.</p>
  <p>Other times,<br>you need to fix a few simple things.</p>

  <p>Impressionism helps your painting,<br>hold a kind of a visual conversation with you.</p>
  <p>A dance,<br>of two.</p>
  <p>What is even more magical,<br>is that your painting will stop asking for more...</p>
  <p>Long before,<br>it begins approaching Hyperrealism.</p>
  <p>Our love of art,<br>that thing in our soul.</p>
  <p>Cares not for mirror images,<br>not exactly.</p>
  <p>It cares that the person in the painting,<br>looks like the person that you painted.</p>
  <p>Through the lens,<br>of a brush.</p>

  <p>Our bodies maybe bound to the chemical signature of this planet,<br>by four billion years of evolution.</p>
  <p>But our minds, reach far beyond,<br>physics and the ordinary, and the predictable.</p>
  <p>We are not computers, not in any way,<br>we are not animals evolved for complex tasks.</p>
  <p>And you feel that,<br>when you sit down the second time to your impressionist painting.</p>
  <p>When you complete it,<br>before it becomes a photo.</p>

Everything we touch must advance forward,
it is just how life works.

It is not a bad thing,
it is not a difficult thing.

It is a reward for being alive,
a reward for being awake.

This does not mean that we jog,
extra ten miles a day, no, no, no.

It means that we identify what stopped us yesterday,
and understand it.

And rise above it,
in dignity and strength.

Everything that surrounds us,
wants to burst out in colors.

But if all we do is stop,
and never try..

Then all we get,
is what we see.

Songs are a good example of that,
they are full of color, patters, and energy.

You just need to slow down,
to hear what they are made out of.

And see how they are just fast enough,
to bring you joy, but not the building plans beneath.

The structure of the colors bursting out of the song,
is for you to study, day by day.

Until you can hear the kicks, claps, hats, ambiance, melody and bass,
and take it apart, and make a note of all the pieces.

And stop, stop, listening to other people's song,
and begin making your own songs that others may listen to.

All the intricate details of all the wonders around us,
they are right before you.

The teachers won't help you understand any of it,
it is you who must reach out, pencil in hand.

It is the same for everything,
from quantum physics, to dance songs, abstract art and oil painting.

All the answers to all the mysteries are right before you,
all you have to do is patiently reach out.

This is one of the biggest gifts of life,
understanding the beauty around us, and maybe creating some more.

We won't understand everything all at once, only one precious step at a time,
and that is both what it takes to start, and what it takes to get to the finish line.

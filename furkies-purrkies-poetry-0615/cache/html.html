  <p>The integrity of your mind must come first,<br>and you must rise and rise, or you'll end up cursed.</p>
  <p>What teachers didn't know to tell you,<br>is it is not just knowledge, but wisdom, and your greatness too.</p>
  <p>Thus, live your live cautiously, authentically and true,<br>and rise, breakthrough after breakthrough.</p>

  <p>Oh, people will come and try to make you more useful,<br>but you have to rage and stay authentic and truthful.</p>
  <p>You are not to simplify other people's lives,<br>you are to fight for your wisdom until it arrives.</p>
  <p>Book after book, quest after quest,<br>do not allow your wisdom to be suppressed.</p>
  <p>Your wisdom stands behind every great decision you make,<br>and it helps you see all the things that are fake.</p>

  <p>Don't let anybody crush you into being sad,<br>or control you into becoming mad.</p>
  <p>Don't let them trick you with grades or promotions,<br>they can't see you and they may even have no emotions.</p>
  <p>If something is attacking you fill countless journals,<br>so that you never forget the alignment of your internals.</p>
  <p>Don't worry, when people push you into an empty void,<br>that is just life showing you who to avoid.</p>

  <p>Your life matters so much because it is similar to a chain link,<br>when you share wisdom it helps others think.</p>
  <p>Humanity is all connected as one family, we are one,<br>one people under the sun.</p>
  <p>Your hard earned lesson help those who face similar sadness,<br>people will accept your advice with gladness.</p>
  <p>All you need to do is enter the culture of rising,<br>rise, and rise, and rise again, without apologizing.</p>

  <p>The world is a little bit broken,<br>as too much of wisdom remains unspoken.</p>
  <p>People without wisdom do not build,<br>they short-circuit leaving promises unfulfilled.</p>
  <p>Lacking wisdom disables lawmen and politicians,<br>in their blindness they can only tarnish their positions.</p>
  <p>This is the world we are all born into,<br>it is why we need you to pursue wisdom and stay true.</p>

  <p>The full reason why grades, careers, and promotions are broken,<br>is rarely spoken:</p>
  <p>To make correct decisions we need a flourishing operating system,<br>and that is our wisdom.</p>
  <p>Without all human beings aiming to become wise,<br>humanity will always short-circuit an never rise.</p>
  <p>Therefore, the world asks that you use wisdom, that ancient art of seeing,<br>to rise and rise, and become a great being.</p>

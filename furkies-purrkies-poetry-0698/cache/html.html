  <p>A pipe is a connection between two programs,<br>and through that pipe, we send an object that is altered to serve some final purpose.</p>
  <p>Imagine you checking email,<br>you create a pipe between your computer and the email server.</p>
  <p>And then you send a request object,<br>with your password and user name.</p>
  <p>The email server,<br>will respond with an object that contains emails.</p>
  <p>So we have programs connected by pipes,<br>through which we send objects.</p>

  <p>When you are writing a program,<br>you are creating a pipework that connects programs.</p>
  <p>And then when your user uses your program,<br>as they interact with buttons, they send objects down the pipes you created.</p>

  <p>While you can make a beautiful little program,<br>that takes good care of user-names and passwords, including their validation.</p>
  <p>You don't have to do it,<br>there is a crude and perfectly functional way to do it with just the basic operations.</p>

  <p>When a user clicks login,<br>and initializes an object down the login to email pipe.</p>
  <p>Rather than doing something special for user name and password,<br>simply inject a new property to the object that the user initialized.</p>
  <p>The first time you inject user-name,<br>second time you inject password.</p>
  <p>This is a generic injection program,<br>where you specify the name of new properties.</p>
  <p>And then you follow up with a pop-up box,<br>that knows to ask for all the properties traveling down the pipe.</p>
  <p>Nothing here is related to passwords,<br>it is just properties and a standard form.</p>

  <p>When working with pipes in a graphic environment,<br>such as Node-RED.</p>
  <p>You can group the generic operations together,<br>and save them as a program called a sub flow.</p>
  <p>The name of this sub-flow would be ask for password,<br>It is perfectly reusable.</p>
  <p>Any object sent through it,<br>will receive an injection of username and password fields, or variables.</p>
  <p>And a automated popup,<br>will force the user to to fill in those two bits of information.</p>

  <p>In more advanced programs like video editors that use pipes,<br>Blender is a good example.</p>
  <p>Pipes enforce the idea that a video is never sent whole,<br>but only one frame at a time.</p>
  <p>The video can be 100 terabytes,<br>but Blender will only take the memory needed for one frame, not the whole video.</p>

  <p>This is what the word streaming means,<br>you are streaming a frame at a time down a connection pipe.</p>

  <p>The black window command line that you see hackers use on TV,<br>is so powerful because it uses pipes.</p>
  <p>It uses the actual pipe character to separate programs,<br>and objects tend to be lines in a file.</p>
  <p>For example, to guess a weak password,<br>a hacker would have a common passwords dictionary file.</p>
  <p>And it would be just one password per line,<br>they would then pipe the passwords to a login program.</p>
  <p>Each line in a file is treated as an object,<br>the program reading the file would send objects one at a time to the program logging in.</p>
  <p>With a successful login,<br>the login program would break the pipe and exit with a happy message.</p>
  <p>And none of the other passwords would continue being streamed,<br>as the pipe is broken, and everything exits, including the program sending the passwords.</p>

  <p>Old school programmers, don't like pipes,<br>they prefer to load an entire movie into memory, process it and be done with it.</p>
  <p>This is not a terrible idea,<br>operations on a video file in RAM are much, much faster then sending frames at a time through pipes.</p>
  <p>Others hate the idea of just three things,<br>Program, Pipe, and Object.</p>
  <p>They are used to creating entire Virtual Systems,<br>with hundred of objects, including a Password Object, User name Object, a Login Object, that contains both...</p>
  <p>And even a remote server object,<br>that is a virtual representation of the mail server.</p>
  <p>Just having Program, Pipe, and Object,<br>is terrifying to them.</p>
  <p>Having just three things,<br>allows for those standard operations like Inject, or Branch depending on whether the login failed or succeed.</p>

  <p>ffmpeg uses pipes in the single most terrifying way,<br>they construct trees of pipes, or meshes really.</p>
  <p>And it is all in a single line of text,<br>and ffmpeg allows for multiple video inputs, whhooh!</p>
  <p>But once you know that it is just three things,<br>you are able to imagine everything in your mind.</p>
  <p>ffmpeg makes it so that all inut files are numbered from zero up,<br>and it names results of transformations, giving you a named connection point to which you can hook in a pipe to another operation.</p>
  <p>So you say ZERO, which means the first file that was mentioned on the command line,<br>then black and white, as in transform video to a black and white movie, and then...</p>
  <p>And then, you name the output of this transformation,<br>BW for example.</p>
  <p>Now, you say BW (just like you said zero a moment ago),<br>followed by add movie grain, (just like we said black and white), and then another name GBW.</p>
  <p>And now you use the GBW output point,<br>and connect it so some other transformation.</p>
  <p>Here we think in threes,<br>INPUT_NAME, TRANSFORMATION, OUTPUT_NAME.</p>
  <p>We are focusing on connecting transformed data to to other transforming programs,<br>our named output is connected to a filer as input.</p>
  <p>And sometimes names are optional in sequential operations.<br>it makes them easy to read, so that you don't have to keep naming the outputs and referencing them in inputs.</p>
  <p>It would be a fun project to create a Node-RED like user interface,<br>for ffmpeg, while you have exactly that in Blender, this program would crown ffmpeg with neat graphics.</p>

  <p>It is possible to reduce the entire Node-RED programs,<br>to hard to read command line, it would totally work - that is the power of keeping things simple.</p>
  <p>Keeping down to a very primitive but capable system,<br>helps prevent leaky abstractions.</p>
  <p>I think all abstractions are leaky,<br>it is just the nature of abstractions.</p>

  <p>A screenful or a card would represent a program,<br>swipes left and right would show you the incoming and outgoing connections.</p>
  <p>A pinch out or zoom out would show the entire network of Pipes and Programs,<br>and if you create a Hub for Program-Card programmers.</p>

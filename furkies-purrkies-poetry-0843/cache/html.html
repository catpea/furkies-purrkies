  <p>I got a fortune cookie once,<br>with the following text:</p>
  <p>"If you do the same things you've always done,<br>you will get the same things you've always got"</p>
  <p>This is trivial and almost silly when applied to an individual,<br>but it becomes something else when applied to generations.</p>

  <p>As laws of the Universe have it, all the bad things that are up in the air,<br>will occur, unless we stand up and prevent them.</p>
  <p>If there is <strong>no one</strong> to prevent Nuclear War,<br>there will be nothing to stop a moron from starting one.</p>
  <p>If you leave it up to the politicians,<br>they'll impose sanctions all right, but 30 years late.</p>

  <p>You see, we did the same things we've always done,<br>and we got the same things we've always been getting.</p>
  <p>Even though, war this day and age,<br>is absolutely the dumbest $%#$%(@ thing in the world.</p>

  <p>It still happened,<br>because of the ghouls that still live in the past.</p>
  <p>There is only one lesson to learn,<br>building path through real education and towards intellectual independence.</p>
  <p>There are too many things left unsaid, between generations,<br>there isn't enough class in the universe to prevent that silence from eventually being broken.</p>

  <p>Do not do things that prevent you from having,<br>a happy future that is worthy of you.</p>
  <p>It is easy not to set a foot in the bar,<br>but it is not so easy to stand up for real education with real and profound results.</p>
  <p>Without learning for real,<br>we will cut ourselves off from anything between creativity all the way up to being able to afford medical care.</p>
  <p>If all we do is get good grades without learning for real,<br>then as the world becomes more entangled by repeating stupid old mistakes we will come closer and closer to extreme poverty.</p>
  <p>Without a powerful body of knowledge built across an entire lifetime,<br>one that cannot be conjured up in the last minute by cramming, we will get looped around in a mad circle.</p>
  <p>Without real education,<br>there will be nowhere to go, but straight to the beginning... of the previous century.</p>

  <p>If politicians were able to help,<br>you would be equipped with a Universal Income card that would make your parents green with envy.</p>
  <p>And a clunky but fantastic and privacy respecting gadget,<br>that will lead you through world's most bellowed modern non-fiction.</p>
  <p>Don't, let, anybody, to, mess, with, your, education,<br>not politicians, not teachers, and especially not parents.</p>

  <p>You are in a very weird position now,<br>because High School is pretending to teach you.</p>
  <p>While doing an outstanding job convincing you,<br>that their horse shit curricula add-up, to make you knowledgeable.</p>
  <p>And what you need to do, is start learning in a school you create for yourself,<br>which will make your fake-school grades take a permanent nose-dive.</p>
  <p>I hope I am wrong, but I suspect that if you start learning for real in High School,<br>your standardized grades will be so bad you will have to repeat the last year.</p>
  <p>You will have to take the school you've built for yourself,<br>and turn it in a school that others can learn from, for real.</p>

  <p>Now listen carefully, politicians will not help you,<br>because they know exactly how little it would take for you to become smarter than they are.</p>
  <p>Do not merely ignore the people pushing you away from making your life and this world beautiful,<br>listen to them VERY carefully, and neither forget <strong>who</strong> they are, nor let them get under your skin.</p>
  <p>Kurt Vonnegut captures the situation that you have to prevent from occurring in one of his precious quotes,<br>"True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country."</p>
  <p>Don't look back, fight to make your way, towards intellectual independence,<br>towards knowledge, wisdom, and your greatness.</p>
  <p>What follows is a very tiny list of interesting people,<br>maybe you can find something of interest here.</p>
  <p>Remember, a great part of the meaning of life,<br>is found in becoming a great being.</p>

  "text": "I got a fortune cookie once,\nwith the following text:\n\"If you do the same things you've always done,\nyou will get the same things you've always got\"\nThis is trivial and almost silly when applied to an individual,\nbut it becomes something else when applied to generations.\n\nAs laws of the Universe have it, all the bad things that are up in the air,\nwill occur, unless we stand up and prevent them.\nIf there is no one to prevent Nuclear War,\nthere will be nothing to stop a moron from starting one.\nIf you leave it up to the politicians,\nthey'll impose sanctions all right, but 30 years late.\n\nYou see, we did the same things we've always done,\nand we got the same things we've always been getting.\nEven though, war this day and age,\nis absolutely the dumbest $%#$%(@ thing in the world.\n\nIt still happened,\nbecause of the ghouls that still live in the past.\nThere is only one lesson to learn,\nbuilding path through real education and towards intellectual independence.\nThere are too many things left unsaid, between generations,\nthere isn't enough class in the universe to prevent that silence from eventually being broken.\n\nDo not do things that prevent you from having,\na happy future that is worthy of you.\nIt is easy not to set a foot in the bar,\nbut it is not so easy to stand up for real education with real and profound results.\nWithout learning for real,\nwe will cut ourselves off from anything between creativity all the way up to being able to afford medical care.\nIf all we do is get good grades without learning for real,\nthen as the world becomes more entangled by repeating stupid old mistakes we will come closer and closer to extreme poverty.\nWithout a powerful body of knowledge built across an entire lifetime,\none that cannot be conjured up in the last minute by cramming, we will get looped around in a mad circle.\nWithout real education,\nthere will be nowhere to go, but straight to the beginning... of the previous century.\n\nIf politicians were able to help,\nyou would be equipped with a Universal Income card that would make your parents green with envy.\nAnd a clunky but fantastic and privacy respecting gadget,\nthat will lead you through world's most bellowed modern non-fiction.\nDon't, let, anybody, to, mess, with, your, education,\nnot politicians, not teachers, and especially not parents.\n\nYou are in a very weird position now,\nbecause High School is pretending to teach you.\nWhile doing an outstanding job convincing you,\nthat their horse shit curricula add-up, to make you knowledgeable.\nAnd what you need to do, is start learning in a school you create for yourself,\nwhich will make your fake-school grades take a permanent nose-dive.\nI hope I am wrong, but I suspect that if you start learning for real in High School,\nyour standardized grades will be so bad you will have to repeat the last year.\nYou will have to take the school you've built for yourself,\nand turn it in a school that others can learn from, for real.\n\nNow listen carefully, politicians will not help you,\nbecause they know exactly how little it would take for you to become smarter than they are.\nDo not merely ignore the people pushing you away from making your life and this world beautiful,\nlisten to them VERY carefully, and neither forget who they are, nor let them get under your skin.\nKurt Vonnegut captures the situation that you have to prevent from occurring in one of his precious quotes,\n\"True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country.\"\nDon't look back, fight to make your way, towards intellectual independence,\ntowards knowledge, wisdom, and your greatness.\nWhat follows is a very tiny list of interesting people,\nmaybe you can find something of interest here.\nRemember, a great part of the meaning of life,\nis found in becoming a great being.\n * Plato[1]\n * Aristotle[2]\n * Baruch Spinoza[3]\n * David Hume[4]\n * Immanuel Kant[5]\n * Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel[6]\n * Soren Kierkegaard[7]\n * Friedrich Nietzsche[8]\n * John Dewey[9]\n * Greta Thunberg[10]\n * Michelle Alexander[11]\n * Sir Ken Robinson[12]\n * Astra Taylor[13]\n * Avital Ronell[14]\n * Martha Nussbaum[15]\n * Jill Tarter[16]\n * Bren√© Brown[17]\n * Richard Dawkins[18]\n * Ayaan Hirsi Ali[19]\n * Ayn Rand[20]\n * Lord

  <p>Art is something we all adore,<br>but it has always been at war.</p>
  <p>The greatest creators,<br>and machine inventors.</p>
  <p>Versus the Free Hand,<br>who call machines contraband.</p>
  <p>Renascence was born of machines,<br>born to impress Royal Queens.</p>
  <p>But, no one ever says anything,<br>and a lot of artists are lying.</p>
  <p>A lot are suffering,<br>as if their hands are tied with string.</p>
  <p>They don't know how the others draw so well,<br>and most of them will never tell.</p>

  <p>But art is the noblest science,<br>born of beauty and defiance.</p>
  <p>In the beginning she gifts us the best:<br>realism at its finest.</p>
  <p>She does not want us to worry about crooked lines,<br>she wants us to break <strong>out of</strong> their confines.</p>
  <p>And in deed,<br>we are all granted <strong>all</strong> the tools we need.</p>
  <p>From proportional dividers, to all kinds of tracing,<br>she wants to set our hearts racing.</p>
  <p>Art wants to set us free,<br>not get an art degree.</p>

  <p>Important part of your art,<br>are the machines at its heart.</p>
  <p>The critics and teachers,<br>can't understand all the features.</p>
  <p>School was always wrong about thinking free,<br>it was always about you paying some fee.</p>

  <p>Art must never deny entry,<br>we should all practice realism in elementary.</p>
  <p>We should all be invited to art,<br>because it is just another expression of our heart.</p>
  <p>It is OK to make the lines perfect,<br>and all the colors perfectly correct.</p>
  <p>And it is evil to say,<br>that you can't copy, or have it your way.</p>

  <p>Only when realism becomes something that we have outgrown,<br>can we truly say that our style ... is our own.</p>

Art is something we all adore,
but it has always been at war.

The greatest creators,
and machine inventors.

Versus the Free Hand,
who call machines contraband.

Renascence was born of machines,
born to impress Royal Queens.

But, no one ever says anything,
and a lot of artists are lying.

A lot are suffering,
as if their hands are tied with string.

They don't know how the others draw so well,
and most of them will never tell.

But art is the noblest science,
born of beauty and defiance.

In the beginning she gifts us the best:
realism at its finest.

She does not want us to worry about crooked lines,
she wants us to break __out of__ their confines.

And in deed,
we are all granted __all__ the tools we need.

From proportional dividers, to all kinds of tracing,
she wants to set our hearts racing.

Art wants to set us free,
not get an art degree.

Important part of your art,
are the machines at its heart.

The critics and teachers,
can't understand all the features.

School was always wrong about thinking free,
it was always about you paying some fee.

---

Art must never deny entry,
we should all practice realism in elementary.

We should all be invited to art,
because it is just another expression of our heart.

It is OK to make the lines perfect,
and all the colors perfectly correct.

And it is evil to say,
that you can't copy, or have it your way.

---

Only when realism becomes something that we have outgrown,
can we truly say that our style ... is our own.

Music is not something you learn,
it is something you unleash.

Forget music theory,
invent your own thory.

Lmms will get you started,
take the [lmms tutorial][1], and hit the can!

---

I consider cans to be bell like instruments, or cymbals,
and I think it is a good idea to leave higher pitches sounds for last.

When you start with plastic bottles,
you get a sound that fills the background of you song.

There is just more echo,
and the sound is more profound and loooonger.

I don't use forks,
so I brought one of my metal chopsticks with me.

I will start by playing my water bottle,
it is a thick, rectangular two liter face twisting watermelon juice, juice bottle.

I won't start with just one strike of the bottle,
I like my drums complex.

But more than that,
I like to hit my drums in such a way that it creates a double whammy.

---

A transition between two sounds,
at first you will hear the two hits separately then I'll mix them up a bit.

Upon the resolution of the intro, I will very gently introduce a third drum,
also based on my water bottle.

But that is just to give an occasional deeper hit,
as if an exclamation mark at the end of a sentence.

The tempo will be set to 280 beats per minute,
and I will slowly turn up the re-verb, bass boost and the equalizer as we go.

(intro plays)

I have purchased a little red mixing bowl for my salads recently,
and grabbed it last time I was downstairs.

We will use it is to deepen the drum,
creating an evolving exclamation mark.

I also hit my water bottle too hard on the edge,
and rather than it marking a sound, it was metal chopstick that stole the show.

So I'll mix in a gentle metallic sound,
as if to throw in a bit of Jalapeno into our salad.

It just happens that the metallic sounds helps us move,
so the introduction jumps right into fast dance.

Grab onto something,
and give this a listen.

(dance plays)

Now, no drum kit is complete,
without a bucket and fruit can.

Though un-intimidating raw,
with a touch of bass, a bucket is as mighty as it sounds.

(middle plays)

I recently 3D printed a wallet prototype dodad,
and it turns out to be very drum like when struck with my chopsticks.

So as the song winds down,
and introduce it to add a little bid of wood like drum.

Here is the song in full,
I hope you enjoy it.

After the song, I have included,
the raw unfiltered version.

It may not be very fun to listen to,
but it is interesting to hear the raw instruments.

And now,
for the unprocessed version.

  <p>I consider cans to be bell like instruments, or cymbals,<br>and I think it is a good idea to leave higher pitches sounds for last.</p>
  <p>When you start with plastic bottles,<br>you get a sound that fills the background of you song.</p>
  <p>There is just more echo,<br>and the sound is more profound and loooonger.</p>
  <p>I don't use forks,<br>so I brought one of my metal chopsticks with me.</p>
  <p>I will start by playing my water bottle,<br>it is a thick, rectangular two liter face twisting watermelon juice, juice bottle.</p>
  <p>I won't start with just one strike of the bottle,<br>I like my drums complex.</p>
  <p>But more than that,<br>I like to hit my drums in such a way that it creates a double whammy.</p>

  <p>A transition between two sounds,<br>at first you will hear the two hits separately then I'll mix them up a bit.</p>
  <p>Upon the resolution of the intro, I will very gently introduce a third drum,<br>also based on my water bottle.</p>
  <p>But that is just to give an occasional deeper hit,<br>as if an exclamation mark at the end of a sentence.</p>
  <p>The tempo will be set to 280 beats per minute,<br>and I will slowly turn up the re-verb, bass boost and the equalizer as we go.</p>
  <p>(intro plays)</p>
  <p>I have purchased a little red mixing bowl for my salads recently,<br>and grabbed it last time I was downstairs.</p>
  <p>We will use it is to deepen the drum,<br>creating an evolving exclamation mark.</p>
  <p>I also hit my water bottle too hard on the edge,<br>and rather than it marking a sound, it was metal chopstick that stole the show.</p>
  <p>So I'll mix in a gentle metallic sound,<br>as if to throw in a bit of Jalapeno into our salad.</p>
  <p>It just happens that the metallic sounds helps us move,<br>so the introduction jumps right into fast dance.</p>
  <p>Grab onto something,<br>and give this a listen.</p>
  <p>(dance plays)</p>
  <p>Now, no drum kit is complete,<br>without a bucket and fruit can.</p>
  <p>Though un-intimidating raw,<br>with a touch of bass, a bucket is as mighty as it sounds.</p>
  <p>(middle plays)</p>
  <p>I recently 3D printed a wallet prototype dodad,<br>and it turns out to be very drum like when struck with my chopsticks.</p>
  <p>So as the song winds down,<br>and introduce it to add a little bid of wood like drum.</p>
  <p>Here is the song in full,<br>I hope you enjoy it.</p>
  <p>After the song, I have included,<br>the raw unfiltered version.</p>
  <p>It may not be very fun to listen to,<br>but it is interesting to hear the raw instruments.</p>

  <p>And now,<br>for the unprocessed version.</p>

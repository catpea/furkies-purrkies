    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I consider cans to be bell like instruments, or cymbals,<br>and I think it is a good idea to leave higher pitches sounds for last.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When you start with plastic bottles,<br>you get a sound that fills the background of you song.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is just more echo,<br>and the sound is more profound and loooonger.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I don't use forks,<br>so I brought one of my metal chopsticks with me.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I will start by playing my water bottle,<br>it is a thick, rectangular two liter face twisting watermelon juice, juice bottle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I won't start with just one strike of the bottle,<br>I like my drums complex.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But more than that,<br>I like to hit my drums in such a way that it creates a double whammy.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A transition between two sounds,<br>at first you will hear the two hits separately then I'll mix them up a bit.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Upon the resolution of the intro, I will very gently introduce a third drum,<br>also based on my water bottle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But that is just to give an occasional deeper hit,<br>as if an exclamation mark at the end of a sentence.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The tempo will be set to 280 beats per minute,<br>and I will slowly turn up the re-verb, bass boost and the equalizer as we go.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(intro plays)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I have purchased a little red mixing bowl for my salads recently,<br>and grabbed it last time I was downstairs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We will use it is to deepen the drum,<br>creating an evolving exclamation mark.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I also hit my water bottle too hard on the edge,<br>and rather than it marking a sound, it was metal chopstick that stole the show.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So I'll mix in a gentle metallic sound,<br>as if to throw in a bit of Jalapeno into our salad.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It just happens that the metallic sounds helps us move,<br>so the introduction jumps right into fast dance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Grab onto something,<br>and give this a listen.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(dance plays)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Now, no drum kit is complete,<br>without a bucket and fruit can.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though un-intimidating raw,<br>with a touch of bass, a bucket is as mighty as it sounds.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(middle plays)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I recently 3D printed a wallet prototype dodad,<br>and it turns out to be very drum like when struck with my chopsticks.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So as the song winds down,<br>and introduce it to add a little bid of wood like drum.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here is the song in full,<br>I hope you enjoy it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">After the song, I have included,<br>the raw unfiltered version.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It may not be very fun to listen to,<br>but it is interesting to hear the raw instruments.</div>

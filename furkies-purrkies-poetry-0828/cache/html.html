  <p>Upon having sculpted my <a href="https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1955.375#">little Peru froggie friend</a>,<br>I begun pondering what more can be done with little rebuilt artifacts.</p>
  <p>I came across a really sad story from Pompeii,<br>about <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/sorceresss-kit-was-discovered-ashes-pompeii-180972907/">A Sorceress’ Kit</a> being found.</p>
  <p>There I noticed all the little bits had holes in them,<br>to hang them on necklaces and such.</p>
  <p>So selling a Sorcerer’s Kit,<br>is another thing that can be done.</p>

  <p>I pondered creating a low polygon version,<br>which is a geometric wire frame.</p>
  <p>But this has to be designed from scratch as such,<br>reducing geometry of a sculpted piece just distorts it.</p>

  <p>For blobby sculptures like the froggie,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A56g5VkznUA">it is easy to apply the Solidify modifier to make it hollow</a>.</p>
  <p>Using a boolean modifier to subtract some of the bottom,<br>can make a sculpture it stand flat.</p>

  <p>I think my best idea is to split the froggie,<br>very much like the original.</p>
  <p>Which calls for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moPDPB4MY2U">intersecting it with a plane</a>,<br>using difference boolean modifier and parting it.</p>
  <p>Then giving it thickness with Solidify,<br>followed by a hinge and a locking mechanism.</p>
  <p>This way it can become a little trinket box,<br>this seems like something that should be done manually.</p>
  <p>Geometry nodes, may not be the best choice here,<br>because of how complex the sculpted mesh usually is.</p>

  <p><a href="https://lite.qwant.com/?q=3D+Jewelry&t=images">Majority of 3D printed jewelry is about thin wires</a>,<br>a lot of open space that a human hand can’t create.</p>
  <p>It makes a piece look intricate,<br>and saves on material costs.</p>
  <p>I have noticed <a href="https://www.instructables.com/3D-Print-Infill-Jewelry/">plastic jewelry somewhat seems OK</a>,<br>a golden silky filament could maybe make something, but I am not too sure.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche_culture">Moche Culture</a> that the Froggie originates from,<br>is theorized to have faded away 1300 years ago due to climate change.</p>
  <p>I could tell the original artist was studying frogs,<br>it wasn’t just from memory.</p>
  <p>They gave the frog a belly, a strong brow, a nose,<br><a href="https://piction.clevelandart.org/cma/ump.di?e=51FCB021712D452AA0FDE31D4E0935E13629F9042C90C05AFBAB146AC74EF6F5&s=24247294&se=1672797228&v=1&f=%5C1955.375det01_o2.jpg">and there is a hint of front legs too</a>.</p>
  <p>Whether it is jewelry, a game piece,<br>or sold as an STL digital model that others can use in their own pursuits.</p>
  <p>Rebuilding a 1500 year old artifact,<br>was quite an amazing adventure.</p>

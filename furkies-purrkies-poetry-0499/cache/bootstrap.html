    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In this text, I wanted to give a couple of examples,<br>of removing frustrations from art creations,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Above all creating Art is a multi-day expedition,<br>our mightiest works of art require sitting down to them multiple times, from multiple perspectives.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">First allow me to make a note on the Subject of Oil Paining,<br>and then forgive me, for babbling on about computer programming in relation to music composition.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To be fair to your self and your Oil Painting, your next great creation,<br>especially if you are new to painting, but this works really well for masters too, take all the time in the world.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Know your colors, don't sit there mixing them,<br>know exactly the number of colors you need, and pre-mix them long before you sit down to the painting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Create a few abstract paintings that have the paints that will touch in your final masterpiece,<br>touch in some novel way, and then ask your self, if there is anything you can do to improve your colors.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Go to a Hardware Store, get some large sheets of Plywood,<br>and paint a portion of your painting, maybe lips nose and eyes on a 4ftx8ft Poplar Sanded Plywood.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_rwgbvVicE">create several miniatures</a>,<br>as those are sure to refine your color composition to perfection.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Approach the subject of your painting with multiple paintings,<br>don't ask about the color during a sitting, have your palette mixed, and refined.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Use a Movie or Office Projector, to save yourself time,<br>when copying proportions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Use GIMP, to explore the shapes and composition,<br>by applying filters that pixelate or lower the number of colors in your subject photo.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4Hc5A0kkkk">Don't forget about the old masters</a>,<br>starting out with a gray under-painting will answer all the rest of the questions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And please, time lapse all your projects,<br>and create a series of videos that document your <em>exploration</em> of the subject and the final masterpiece.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My recent study of music theory, was not just about learning,<br>but checking how useful music theory is in composition.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here it took multiple days,<br>begun with <a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/">The Learning Music Tutorial</a> and Closed With [Music Theory Tutorial Videos].</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I found that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=LMMS+Tutorial">LMMS</a> makes it so that there is no need to practice the Piano,<br>and that the next step should be replacing LMMS with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=JavaScript+OOP+Tutorial">Object Oriented Programming</a> layer over <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And now I determined that the best way to approach song creation,<br>is to build a code generator not unlike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Yaoman+Tutorial">Yeoman</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It will ask some questions,<br>and then neatly spread out all the little code files needed to make a song.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Digital Audio Workstations like LMMS, require that you sit there and click all the little buttons,<br>but this program, will randomize all the necessary button clicks, and even pick at random from a library of sound samples.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The song it generates requires editing, as some of the things picked at random,<br>may sound odd, or maybe there are better sound samples that would really make the song go.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I tried several times to make a song generator in a singe night or two,<br>and I was surprised and quite satisfied with the success, but it required to much to actually generate entire albums.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Using this approach I only issue one command,<br>that by default will set everything randomly and ask no questions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The result I am seeking is my own, private, high quality, and original workout music,<br>that perfectly fits my evolving routine.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In Closing, it is neither fair to our art nor to ourselves,<br>to attempt to create a work of art in as little time as possible.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My first instinct when time came to paint,<br>was, that a painting not only required multiple versions, but several months of sketching with pencils too.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Finding the subject of your painting,<br>is the same as creating a plot for a book.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The same goes for the structure of computer programs,<br>it takes a long time to find the right combination of sub-components.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It took a long time to realize that I don't need a user interface,<br>that editing code made by my generator was the fastest, and most powerful way of creating unique songs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Think about all the works of art that could have been,<br>but fell apart in the hands of their creators because someone tried to go too fast.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Finally, adventure goes well with art,<br>taking your drawing board or notepads, or diagrams out to the Lakes or Seas, Mountains, or Woodlands will help you evolve them into the timeless masterpieces that they deserve to become.</div>

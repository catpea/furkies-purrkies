    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I suppose there probably are people who, to their own detriment, pretend to be ordinary,<br>so that they can do the absolute minimum in life, but that just cuts them off from growing up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When it comes to the complete, cheerful, inquisitive, and healthy minds,<br>they are perfectly unique; nothing standard; nothing ordinary.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is no way that another being could replace a friend,<br>no two people are alike, no two beings the same interests, nobody dreams the same dreams.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And that is just considering a single moment in time,<br>lives across time can't be the same, at all.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Not only are there no two individuals that are the same,<br>but it is also impossible to live the same life.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Therefore,<br>there are no ordinary people.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Moreover,<br>we should all live extraordinary lives.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When we are free to grow,<br>we flourish in the most magnificent of ways.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This may come as a surprise, but when we are not limiting ourselves,<br>and when we can freely grow, and grow up, we become extraordinary, just by living free.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">See, the alarm clock is not your heart,<br>it is not supposed to keep you living in a square grid at maximum performance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Often something like this is very convenient to other people,<br>and even the friendliest of them may conspire against you to continue your daily routine.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But we are not robots,<br>we are not automatons.<br>we are not machines.</div>

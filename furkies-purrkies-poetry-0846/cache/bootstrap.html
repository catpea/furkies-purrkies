    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">See, I started writing about writing a program,<br>already made a cool diagram.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even before I got out of bed,<br>but tell you what, that made me sad.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I muttered in my best Cowboy accent “I ain’t writin’ ‘bout no programming again,<br>so sirre Bob I ain’”.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because, I saw this as a test,<br>and then promptly set off on a great quest.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I set off in search of an interesting topic,<br>and searched all between the microscopic and telescopic.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I found 47,<br>from which I picked 11.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And when I finally narrowed it down to one,<br>I knew my wonderful topic quest was done.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And that I would write rhyme,<br>not worth a dime.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To me programming is a lyrical flea,<br>that I must flee.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Or a strange angry bear that waddles around,<br>with this fat tits out, completely bare.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is a fowl owl,<br>that smells foul.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Really, programming is like digging a hole,<br>it will never make a poem whole.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is like learning that compliment,<br>and complement are two different words.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Or that you just peel the peel,<br>because peal, apparently means loud sounds, yikes!</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though I only learned like six words,<br>and stringing them together was like herding birds. </div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I first learned about the letter T,<br>as I grew up wanting to become B. A. Baracus. Mr. T.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As I learned that it is pronounced TEA,<br>like Mr. T.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">While the word was new,<br>it was something I already... knew.</div>

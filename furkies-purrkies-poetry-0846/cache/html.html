  <p>See, I started writing about writing a program,<br>already made a cool diagram.</p>
  <p>Even before I got out of bed,<br>but tell you what, that made me sad.</p>
  <p>And I muttered in my best Cowboy accent “I ain’t writin’ ‘bout no programming again,<br>so sirre Bob I ain’”.</p>
  <p>Because, I saw this as a test,<br>and then promptly set off on a great quest.</p>
  <p>I set off in search of an interesting topic,<br>and searched all between the microscopic and telescopic.</p>
  <p>I found 47,<br>from which I picked 11.</p>
  <p>And when I finally narrowed it down to one,<br>I knew my wonderful topic quest was done.</p>
  <p>And that I would write rhyme,<br>not worth a dime.</p>

  <p>I chose to write about how mightily I fight,<br>to write right.</p>
  <p>To me programming is a lyrical flea,<br>that I must flee.</p>
  <p>Or a strange angry bear that waddles around,<br>with this fat tits out, completely bare.</p>
  <p>It is a fowl owl,<br>that smells foul.</p>
  <p>Really, programming is like digging a hole,<br>it will never make a poem whole.</p>
  <p>It is like learning that compliment,<br>and complement are two different words.</p>
  <p>Or that you just peel the peel,<br>because peal, apparently means loud sounds, yikes!</p>
  <p>Of course you hear,<br>what I am saying here.</p>
  <p>Writing a good poem is like riding a horse,<br>you keep screaming until your voice is hoarse.</p>

  <p>Lemme tell ya, I started learning the Queens tongue,<br>when I was still young.</p>
  <p>Though I only learned like six words,<br>and stringing them together was like herding birds. </p>
  <p>I first learned about the letter T,<br>as I grew up wanting to become B. A. Baracus. Mr. T.</p>
  <p>I started wearing many chains,<br>and begun early, to work on my gains.</p>
  <p>But the first word that really got me,<br>was on a British box of tea.</p>
  <p>As I learned that it is pronounced TEA,<br>like Mr. T.</p>
  <p>While the word was new,<br>it was something I already... knew.</p>
  <p>I was like FFFFFFFFF,<br>for I already knew some simpler words.</p>
  <p>I swore on all the Mr. T chains I wore,<br>that although learning English was going to be war.</p>
  <p>I would fight like a mighty boar,<br>to never become a bore.</p>
  <p>I would fight,<br>like a knight in the night,</p>
  <p>To need all my words to properly kneed,<br>until they became what I really need.</p>
  <p>I would peel the peel,<br>to create lyrical appeal.</p>

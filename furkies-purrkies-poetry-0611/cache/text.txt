While the world is still growing up,
and is yet to end poverty and stop repeating its own mistakes.
The ongoing the disagreements, suspicions, divisions,
are just about levels of education.

Real schools are hard to build,
they may even be impossible.
Forcing standardized knowledge on students,
under a stress of failure is not how a human being learns.

Self education,
should serve as a model for real education.
A student should learn in a sequence that fits them best,
and matches their existing knowledge and predispositions.
Students have to move at a comfortable pace,
and only study when they re ready to study.

Forcing students to learn what they are not interested in.
under a threat of grades is not how education works.
Such a system of punishment can only create a situation
where students don't want to go to school.
Creating a myth,
that children must be taught.
Make schools about wisdom and success,
and the students will learn on their own.

The idea of graduation is a terrible insult,
in reality knowledge is not divided into levels.
In reality,
education is never ending.

Real Education is about Adventures and Investigations,
there is no punishment here.
Failure to accomplish something does not result in a failing grade,
but rather, becomes a delicious new challenge.
The pursuit of one's many curiosities,
creates a much broader landscape of knowledge.

Given room to think and dream,
without a threat of failure of punishment.
Students will self assemble,
structuring a school that matches the need of the current generation.
It is not grades, but wisdom,
that should serve as the encouragement and reward.

Wisdom that old art of seeing,
wisdom the pathway to greatness, peace, and unity.

  <p>Self education,<br>should serve as a model for real education.</p>

  <p>Forcing students to learn what they are not interested in.<br>under a threat of grades is not how education works.</p>

  <p>Creating a myth,<br>that children must be taught.</p>
  <p>Make schools about wisdom and success,<br>and the students will learn on their own.</p>

  <p>It is unclear if parents understand the way children do,<br>it may not be the blight of indoctrination alone that holds us back.</p>
  <p>It maybe that children are so much smarter,<br>and parents so burdened with poverty and confusion, that <strong>everything</strong> is lost in translation.</p>
  <p>Parents know schools are broken, they know their grades were fake,<br>and yet, in their slumber, they send their children towards the same things.</p>
  <p>The children eventually let go of their intelligence, brilliance, and genius,<br>because they can see it interferes with grades, and may even cause <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vHzUTtmbAM">dread (TRIGGER WARNING)</a>.</p>

  <p>We are extremely adaptive,<br>we are not rocks thrown into water.</p>

  <p>I always had trouble understanding how someone can cause harm, or commit a crime,<br>and I came to conclude that a criminal pulls the trigger for the same reason that soldiers around the world do.</p>
  <p>Their view of reality is often permanently warped,<br>and they are under some pressure, and influence.</p>
  <p>It could be influence of alcohol or worse,<br>but also it can be the influence of being court marshaled or even yelled at by someone in control of their existence.</p>
  <p>I immediately realized that criminals are indoctrinated into crime,<br>this religion of crime, is not exactly emergent, it does not exactly come out of nowhere.</p>
  <p>It comes out of poverty, from having parents who drink or do drugs because they can't make their way out of their poverty,<br>and then the threat of the neighborhood bullies, which often, as far as survival goes, means both gangs and the police.</p>
  <p>All those scary individuals that most people agree to keep in cages,<br>are actually just children who had their minds poisoned.</p>
  <p>I wouldn't say that it is a permanent poisoning,<br>I feel that psychologists know this.</p>
  <p>And they also know that by keeping people in cages,<br>we make them worse.</p>
  <p>And I know, that we make ourselves worse for it,<br>a criminal belongs in a Medical Institution specifically built to undo the damage caused by indoctrination.</p>
  <p>Prisons poison the minds of criminals further,<br>what they need is understanding, support, hope, future, - you know real justice.</p>
  <p>More than that, once they are placed into institutions that aren't sick torture,<br>they may not wish to return to be among the people that did this to them.</p>
  <p>Because they will see us ab being indoctrinated into a culture of Retribution and Torture,<br>the criminals that recover, will see the people who were once OK with torturing them as very sick in deed.</p>

  <p>Crime is a particularly potent example of the power of indoctrination,<br>which frequently can be explained as "Acting against themselves".</p>
  <p>But indoctrination is everywhere,<br>meaning that people are doing things that they think are meaningful, but actually they are just hurting themselves or the world.</p>
  <p>Take the other end of the crime spectrum, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrfZuPFrH8A">a cop planting evidence on a known criminal</a> that should be in jail,<br>the cop was brought up in a culture of putting criminals in cages, the criminal was brought up in a culture of crime.</p>
  <p>They are both wrong, they are both just little spinning tops wound up by their indoctrination,<br>in very desperate need of psychological help, but round and round they go.</p>
  <p>In a more advanced civilization, all the parties involved here and their families would be relocated,<br>given a bright new start at life, and over and over again, until they became free of their psychological indoctrination.</p>
  <p>Their new lives would include expensive housing, free money from an Advanced Universal Income program,<br>and room to take to education, and eventually helping others out of their indoctrination.</p>
  <p>See a primitive civilization punishes,<br>an advanced civilization looks to prevention and therapy - we have a lot of work to do.</p>
  <p>Punishing the police officer would only destabilize them further,<br>and punishing those boys, who already have a stressful and desperate life, suffering addiction, debt, poverty, violence, will certainly make things worse.</p>
  <p>There is no solution at the level our civilization is currently operating at,<br>the poor boys are suffering the same condition that otherwise reasonable men from Afghanistan who-dont-want-women-in-school are suffering from.</p>
  <p>Their reality is warped, but they are fighting, tooth and nail, like the Great Warriors we all are,<br>except that the warping of their reality is making them hurt themselves.</p>
  <p>Often self harm becomes apparent, far too late, when one of those boys becomes a father,<br>and watches their son become like they are...</p>
  <p>Except now the father gained a grasp on the invisible prison of cultural and psychological indoctrination he was born into,<br>and is now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk--XN4ozr8">crying that he does not want his son to be like him</a>.</p>
  <p>See, once indoctrination is removed, bullies and thugs,<br>will slowly being self repair.</p>
  <p>Their past life does not stand, in their way towards greatness,<br>we stand in their way.</p>
  <p>By sentencing a person stricken by indoctrination into years in prison,<br>we only make things worse, we hurt them further.</p>
  <p>I believe it was The Great Michelle Alexander that described a Judge crying,<br>for tearing a family apart, because the father did not break out of his indoctrination fast enough, and ended up being sentenced to prison.</p>

  <p>We must ask, how can we help these men out of their indoctrination sooner,<br>and eventually we will find that indoctrination is best prevented.</p>
  <p>One of the major components of Prevention,<br>is ending poverty, granting the entire family Access to Free Money, and Advanced Universal Income.</p>
  <p>No sum in particular,<br>just a respectful and very generous daily spending limit.</p>
  <p>This will go a long way, but the process of un-indoctrination,<br>is brittle, requires decades of therapy and re-education.</p>
  <p>While prevention comes with a clear guarantee,<br>a person already hurt by long therm indoctrination, requires special treatment, preferential treatment.</p>
  <p>It is our misuse of the idea of money, and tolerance of the sick punishment of prisons,<br>that fractures people, that induces the emergence of broken cultures, and repeatedly indoctrinates participants.</p>

  <p>The first step, that you can take as a Politician, Teacher, or Parent, or Leader, or best yet Writer and Narrator,<br>is simply to explain to children why people do bad things:</p>
  <p>They do bad things because the world they think they know is not real,<br>so even though all they are trying to do is good things, like putting food on their table, or keeping their family of neighborhood safe.</p>
  <p>Those things are transformed by the thick layer of the fake reality that is poisoning and suffocating and crushing them,<br>and what looks to them like the right things to do inside their poisoned world, is actually a very bad thing out in our world.</p>

  <p>Here is an opportunity to explain the urgency of real education:<br>so that we don't end up being poisoned and suffocated, and crushed by warped reality.</p>
  <p>We MUST! caution the children about fake or ineffective education,<br>as invisible prison walls are extremely hard to see.</p>
  <p>We have to teach the children to get up at the end of class and say:<br>"Hey Ms. Shmumps, but I didn't learn anything in your class today".</p>
  <p>We have to teach them to recognize fake education,<br>and we know what that is like: as many of us graduated without anything to show for it, certainty nothing we couldn't learn on our own in a fraction of the time.</p>

  <p>Indoctrination is everywhere, most of us were a victim once,<br>be it religions or fake schools, or paid colleges, or military service, or being forced to cleaning gas station toilets as a teenager to make some money.</p>
  <p>You are ABSOLUTELY not allowed to work jobs like that,<br>if it was their idea tell your parents to do it - you study Art, Music Compositions or Industrial Design, focus on your Portfolio.</p>
  <p>You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>you are always meant to grow up for better, never for the same or worse.</p>
  <p>Indoctrination is both (self) emergent such as we find in high crime neighborhoods,<br>and it is designed such as we find in cults, religions and churches.</p>
  <p>The pattern is hard to see as it is stretched across life,<br>and it always benefits you a little and it takes a lot in the end.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Court rulings must consider multi-generational impact,<br>the rulings must be made in context of hundreds of years, not in context of browny points.</p>
  <p>To be clear, let the adults have their fantasy lifestyles if that is what they want,<br>but don't let them warp the minds of the children by presenting a false reality - and what a truly evil deed that is.</p>

  <p>The blight of poverty that we drowned the world in,<br>by failing to make money work for us and making it work against us instead, is another kind of emergent indoctrination.</p>
  <p>The modern cultures finally figured out that we are all born equal,<br>and yet we still force children into the poverty of their parents.</p>
  <p>That is not what equal means, equality means that at birth a child is given enough money,<br>to afford effective tutors that truly teach Knowledge and Wisdom, enough money to own a home, dream about family, and never fear hunger.</p>

Sorry, the weather won't turn,
until after, the Groundhog gets his tax return.

Our Dear Groundhog Leader,
may be a mind reader.

All hail, the Beautiful Groundhog,
the leader of all, from human to dog.

Like Santa he maybe able to hear your every thought,
and he probably listens a lot.

---

The older he gets,
the less he cares, the less regrets.

Maybe he feels he was always too nice,
so now he is bringing the ice.

The ice age - that is,
because control over weather seems to be his.

---

The weather will only turn,
after he gets his tax return.

And he is going to need a quite a penny,
as right now he doesn't have very many.

This worst of all dictators,
probably eats a lot of tators.

And due to the upcoming drought,
he's probably considering purchasing some trout.

But I suppose he wants his tax money,
so he can get shiny diamonds his Lovely Honey.

And what Groundhog Lady doesn't like bling,
especially once the Spring is in full swing.

---

Our Groundhog,
lives in a cute little home beneath a mighty ol log.

And the the colder the weather,
the closer she will snuggle together.

So he's is simply extending the weeks,
because he deeply loves Sweet Cheeks.

But with a potato, a handful of diamonds, and a trout or two,
he will come through.

It will eventually stop snowing,
therefore, Oh the All Knowing.

---

And now you know,
why the Mighty Groundhog makes it snow.

  <p>Sorry, the weather won't turn,<br>until after, the Groundhog gets his tax return.</p>
  <p>Our Dear Groundhog Leader,<br>may be a mind reader.</p>
  <p>All hail, the Beautiful Groundhog,<br>the leader of all, from human to dog.</p>
  <p>Like Santa he maybe able to hear your every thought,<br>and he probably listens a lot.</p>

  <p>The older he gets,<br>the less he cares, the less regrets.</p>
  <p>Maybe he feels he was always too nice,<br>so now he is bringing the ice.</p>
  <p>The ice age - that is,<br>because control over weather seems to be his.</p>

  <p>The weather will only turn,<br>after he gets his tax return.</p>
  <p>And he is going to need a quite a penny,<br>as right now he doesn't have very many.</p>
  <p>This worst of all dictators,<br>probably eats a lot of tators.</p>
  <p>And due to the upcoming drought,<br>he's probably considering purchasing some trout.</p>
  <p>But I suppose he wants his tax money,<br>so he can get shiny diamonds his Lovely Honey.</p>
  <p>And what Groundhog Lady doesn't like bling,<br>especially once the Spring is in full swing.</p>

  <p>Our Groundhog,<br>lives in a cute little home beneath a mighty ol log.</p>
  <p>And the the colder the weather,<br>the closer she will snuggle together.</p>
  <p>So he's is simply extending the weeks,<br>because he deeply loves Sweet Cheeks.</p>
  <p>But with a potato, a handful of diamonds, and a trout or two,<br>he will come through.</p>
  <p>It will eventually stop snowing,<br>therefore, Oh the All Knowing.</p>

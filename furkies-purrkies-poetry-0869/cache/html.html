  <p>I always write computer programs,<br>I am always trying to write something neat.</p>
  <p>It has been quite a journey,<br>long enough to observe technology change.</p>
  <p>I also learned a bunch of languages I don’t use,<br>I use JavaScript now but it used to be slow.</p>
  <p>Back then I wrote in PHP and Perl,<br>I liked them both.</p>
  <p>I am too busy with JavaScript to miss them,<br>there is so much to learn here.</p>

  <p>There is this strange joke<br>that a full stack developer can’t exist.</p>
  <p>People who do everything are either,<br>Unicorns or Crazy.</p>
  <p>There are serious technology limitations that,<br>make the name “Full Stack Developer” sound ridiculous.</p>
  <p>They exist, but they are smart enough,<br>to never tell their employer.</p>
  <p>And writing User Interface, Server,<br>Command, and Design Principles all at once.</p>
  <p>Would make a programmer,<br>a slowpoke.</p>
  <p>Personally, I enjoy the whole round trip,<br>from user interface to server and back.</p>
  <p>But only with JavaScript, as other languages,<br>are just not mature enough.</p>

  <p>In my Java days, dynamic user interface was hard, and it may still be frowned upon,<br>the lovely user interface technology called JavaSwing needed to grow up.</p>
  <p>PHP and Perl could create a user interface,<br>but it would be a bad idea to build something serious.</p>
  <p>Flash; that old web games were coded in,<br>made a leap forward, once.</p>
  <p>Before it all fizzled out, their Action Script language,<br>was very powerful.</p>
  <p>Their UI framework, called Flex,<br>was a decade ahead in prettiness.</p>
  <p>Flash and Flex was amazing,<br>but the Flash Player had bugs.</p>
  <p>And one company wouldn't allow it on their phone,<br>in part because it drained battery.</p>
  <p>But also because it was somebody else code,<br>and that would be the thing that people would write apps in.</p>
  <p>You don’t want some other company,<br>to own the language that your apps are written in.</p>

  <p>As to the bugs Flash was probably written,<br>in a a low level programming language.</p>
  <p>That usually means,<br>humans manage the memory.</p>
  <p>That often means that a person can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD-iXWANggo">inject program instructions</a>,<br>and may get access to the OS.</p>
  <p>Low level languages are fast for lack of bounds checking,<br>but they are also hard, dangerous, and slow to code in.</p>
  <p>JavaScript takes care of everything,<br>you just say a = “hello” and it will take care of it for you.</p>
  <p>In C you have to make an array, or a list,<br>and then put letters in it.</p>
  <p>You also have to specify how big the array is,<br>and you can’t go over that number.</p>
  <p>If you do, then you may damage memory,<br>for some other thing, or allow code injection.</p>

  <p>Just a moment ago, I generated code files on my disk,<br>using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrNwo4wXOs">babel</a> which allowed me to use syntax that is not yet part of JavaScript.</p>
  <p>I triggered this generation, on the server,<br>under the control of a sweet event Emitter by means of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKEqqIO7n-k">engine.io</a>.</p>
  <p>I actually don’t really see a difference,<br>between talking to a program component or a server.</p>
  <p>It is all event emitters, I don’t have to manage web sockets,<br>and they are so helpful.</p>
  <p>But that is just the server magic,<br>my user interface, allows for complex automatic layouts.</p>
  <p>My programs and website work on large screens, and tiny ones,<br>as I use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_9u1P5YjVc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9joIM91nLzd_qaH_AimmdAR">Bootstrap</a>, it took some getting used to .</p>
  <p>But more than that, I use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=043h4ugAj4c">svelte</a>,<br>so my program automatically reacts to me making assignments to variables.</p>
  <p>I don’t have to remember to call userInterfaceUpdate(),<br>nor do I have to pollute my code with it.</p>
  <p>But even more than that,<br>I can build my own code editor in a singe afternoon.</p>
  <p>And I can inject a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxiFiHZ_lg">code editing area</a>,<br>anywhere in my user interface.</p>
  <p>Visual Basic, C, Perl, PHP, ActionScript, Java,<br>just don’t do this kind of thing.</p>
  <p>They can each do one thing,<br>but not everything at once like I can do in an afternoon.</p>

  <p>And you know, I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRoy1fJbMls">gulp</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9ZZT2m58yo">vinyl</a> for my virtual file system,<br>and my server code is less than 10 lines and I have access to all gulp plugins.</p>
  <p>It is not any one thing that makes this kind of programming so mighty,<br>it is all the things combined together in simple harmony.</p>

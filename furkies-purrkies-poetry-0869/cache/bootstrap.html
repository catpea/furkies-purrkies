    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It has been quite a journey,<br>long enough to observe technology change.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I also learned a bunch of languages I don’t use,<br>I use JavaScript now but it used to be slow.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Back then I wrote in PHP and Perl,<br>I liked them both.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I am too busy with JavaScript to miss them,<br>there is so much to learn here.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">People who do everything are either,<br>Unicorns or Crazy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There are serious technology limitations that,<br>make the name “Full Stack Developer” sound ridiculous.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They exist, but they are smart enough,<br>to never tell their employer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And writing User Interface, Server,<br>Command, and Design Principles all at once.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Would make a programmer,<br>a slowpoke.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Personally, I enjoy the whole round trip,<br>from user interface to server and back.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But only with JavaScript, as other languages,<br>are just not mature enough.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In my Java days, dynamic user interface was hard, and it may still be frowned upon,<br>the lovely user interface technology called JavaSwing needed to grow up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">PHP and Perl could create a user interface,<br>but it would be a bad idea to build something serious.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Flash; that old web games were coded in,<br>made a leap forward, once.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Before it all fizzled out, their Action Script language,<br>was very powerful.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Their UI framework, called Flex,<br>was a decade ahead in prettiness.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Flash and Flex was amazing,<br>but the Flash Player had bugs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And one company wouldn't allow it on their phone,<br>in part because it drained battery.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But also because it was somebody else code,<br>and that would be the thing that people would write apps in.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You don’t want some other company,<br>to own the language that your apps are written in.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As to the bugs Flash was probably written,<br>in a a low level programming language.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That usually means,<br>humans manage the memory.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That often means that a person can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD-iXWANggo">inject program instructions</a>,<br>and may get access to the OS.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Low level languages are fast for lack of bounds checking,<br>but they are also hard, dangerous, and slow to code in.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">JavaScript takes care of everything,<br>you just say a = “hello” and it will take care of it for you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In C you have to make an array, or a list,<br>and then put letters in it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You also have to specify how big the array is,<br>and you can’t go over that number.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you do, then you may damage memory,<br>for some other thing, or allow code injection.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just a moment ago, I generated code files on my disk,<br>using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLrNwo4wXOs">babel</a> which allowed me to use syntax that is not yet part of JavaScript.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I triggered this generation, on the server,<br>under the control of a sweet event Emitter by means of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKEqqIO7n-k">engine.io</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I actually don’t really see a difference,<br>between talking to a program component or a server.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is all event emitters, I don’t have to manage web sockets,<br>and they are so helpful.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But that is just the server magic,<br>my user interface, allows for complex automatic layouts.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My programs and website work on large screens, and tiny ones,<br>as I use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_9u1P5YjVc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9joIM91nLzd_qaH_AimmdAR">Bootstrap</a>, it took some getting used to .</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But more than that, I use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=043h4ugAj4c">svelte</a>,<br>so my program automatically reacts to me making assignments to variables.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I don’t have to remember to call userInterfaceUpdate(),<br>nor do I have to pollute my code with it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But even more than that,<br>I can build my own code editor in a singe afternoon.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I can inject a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRxiFiHZ_lg">code editing area</a>,<br>anywhere in my user interface.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Visual Basic, C, Perl, PHP, ActionScript, Java,<br>just don’t do this kind of thing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They can each do one thing,<br>but not everything at once like I can do in an afternoon.</div>

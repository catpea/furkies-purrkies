While not everything can be planned,
authenticity and learning go hand in hand.

Some lessons can get pretty tough,
but will fix us, sure enough.

When life gets sad or feels no good,
it may be something you misunderstood.

And our views will shift,
and we'll convert that bad into a gift.

Pretenders, can't learn this way,
always in the dark, be it night or day.

They walk an alien path,
darkness and wrath.

There is nothing there to fix,
it's all an incomprehensible mix.

To live on a spectrum opposite of devious,
makes each day connect with the previous,

And as days add up, they make you stronger,
and your steps travel even longer.

Each day turns into gifts and rewards,
you stop being played, and create your own chords.

Authenticity is a superpower,
it will help you rise, and you'll never cower.

Day after day you become more powerful,
this is how we become truly beautiful.

It will help you finish what you start,
and your life, will become, a work of art.

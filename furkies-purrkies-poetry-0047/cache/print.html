  <div class="paragraph">What a great robbery it would be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">If your parents sent you to college.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And teachers sold disconnected snippets.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And called it knowledge.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And wouldn't it be convenient,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if you could chose you next batch.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">had you called, that, a choice.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And then at the end of the day.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When hard earned money was taken.</div>

</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Education, requires that you learn on your own,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that something that teaching can only postpone.</div>

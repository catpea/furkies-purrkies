Think of a trickster, a real bad fool.

What a great robbery it would be.
If your parents sent you to college.
And teachers sold disconnected snippets.
And called it knowledge.

And wouldn't it be convenient,
if you could chose you next batch.
Wouldn't the trickster rejoice,
had you called, that, a choice.

And then at the end of the day.
When hard earned money was taken.
You wouldn't even be shaking,
even though it was worse than a break-in.

Think of a trickster, a real bad fool,
that took away your very own school.

The moral of this story,
is that you should think through,
when someone offers to teach you.

Education, requires that you learn on your own,
that something that teaching can only postpone.

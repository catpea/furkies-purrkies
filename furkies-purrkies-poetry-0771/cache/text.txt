Abandon sketches, think in layers,
and strategist layer after layer.
For example, face, body, and a basic background,
form three layers.
The magic of building paintings,
begins the moment you look behind your first character.
It maybe an idea to hold the horizon,
and leave the farthest points for last.
This way you can be building and imagining,
layer by layer, until you reach the very end.

Building paintings,
is a method of building out a scene step by step.
Rather than starting with a sketch,
which lock you in.
You expand the scene,
as you go deeper and deeper into your painting.
A sketch, assumes,
that the initial idea you have is correct.
Building layer by layer is about meditating over,
what you are working on.

Moreover, after you finish the portrait,
you may wish to change the pose.
And the pose may alter,
the attitude of the painting.
For example, there is a very thin line between,
relaxed and defiant, or cute and force of nature.

In Pop Surrealism, you must hold a conversation,
with your painting.
And digital painting,
which is an upgrade to standard painting.
Is ready to help you resize the canvas,
as many times as you need.

In school we are taught,
to build out the scene first, but that is wrong.
Composition of a future masterpiece is an interactive process,
not a step that you move past, or check of your list.

Poetically speaking,
Leonardo DaVinci might have muttered:
“I wish I could do better. I wish my inventions had more precision,
but I am limited by the technology of my time”
And here in modern days,
teachers teach how paint the way he did, and that is wrong.
Converse,
play chess with your painting.

Like in life, each decision you make,
should significantly alter, what the final version will look like.
Do not start with a sketch,
do not start with a life already lived.
Digital Painting,
is a superpower.
Your brush,
can create microscopic details.
And your canvas,
is infinitely large.

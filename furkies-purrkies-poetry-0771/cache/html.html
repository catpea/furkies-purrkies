  <p>Abandon sketches, think in layers,<br>and strategist layer after layer.</p>
  <p>For example, face, body, and a basic background,<br>form three layers.</p>
  <p>The magic of building paintings,<br>begins the moment you look behind your first character.</p>
  <p>It maybe an idea to hold the horizon,<br>and leave the farthest points for last.</p>
  <p>This way you can be building and imagining,<br>layer by layer, until you reach the very end.</p>

  <p>Building paintings,<br>is a method of building out a scene step by step.</p>
  <p>Rather than starting with a sketch,<br>which lock you in.</p>
  <p>You expand the scene,<br>as you go deeper and deeper into your painting.</p>
  <p>A sketch, assumes,<br>that the initial idea you have is correct.</p>
  <p>Building layer by layer is about meditating over,<br>what you are working on.</p>

  <p>Moreover, after you finish the portrait,<br>you may wish to change the pose.</p>
  <p>And the pose may alter,<br>the attitude of the painting.</p>
  <p>For example, there is a very thin line between,<br>relaxed and defiant, or cute and force of nature.</p>

  <p>And digital painting,<br>which is an upgrade to standard painting.</p>
  <p>Is ready to help you resize the canvas,<br>as many times as you need.</p>

  <p>In school we are taught,<br>to build out the scene first, but that is wrong.</p>
  <p>Composition of a future masterpiece is an interactive process,<br>not a step that you move past, or check of your list.</p>

  <p>Poetically speaking,<br>Leonardo DaVinci might have muttered:</p>
  <p>“I wish I could do better. I wish my inventions had more precision,<br>but I am limited by the technology of my time”</p>
  <p>And here in modern days,<br>teachers teach how paint the way he did, and that is wrong.</p>

  <p>Like in life, each decision you make,<br>should significantly alter, what the final version will look like.</p>
  <p>Do not start with a sketch,<br>do not start with a life already lived.</p>
  <p>Digital Painting,<br>is a superpower.</p>
  <p>Your brush,<br>can create microscopic details.</p>
  <p>And your canvas,<br>is infinitely large.</p>

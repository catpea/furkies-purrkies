I always enjoyed driving to Nordhouse at night,
arriving in Ludington by the morning light.

I'd park at the supermarket and nap,
and later plan my day with my trusty map.

The lake town atmosphere is different somehow,
an infinite horizon just makes me dream and meow.

Upon waking up from my dream,
I'd hop around to get some ice cream.

Then, once I got some water and food,
and I was sure that I was prepared nice and good...

I'd make the final stretch of the quest,
feeling blissful and blessed.

There is this nice parking lot,
where I'd stop to eat the trail mix I bought.

And there is this silly bench,
where my thirst I'd quench.

It is tilted and very tall,
it takes good balance not to fall.

One time marching around the nearby park,
I noticed two older tourist ladies collecting bark.

Tree lovers I thought,
as I entered the parking lot.

Then I've noticed one of the ladies sniffing or eating a leaf,
so I went over there with a look of disbelief.

And said "Oh my god you guys that's poison ivy, don't touch that."
the lady masticating immediately spat.

And then I quickly hurried away,
as they both started making chicken noises and the quiet one started to pray.

---

I got some more water out of my car,
and returned to my tall bench which wasn't far.

I laid down,
contemplating what I should get next time I am in town.

Then I dragged myself back to the car,
getting ready to drive to the camping area which is near by,

As I was driving away one of the ladies looked out of her camper with a smile,
her expression said, "You got us good, I like your style."

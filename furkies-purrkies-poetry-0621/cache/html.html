  <p>I always enjoyed driving to Nordhouse at night,<br>arriving in Ludington by the morning light.</p>
  <p>I'd park at the supermarket and nap,<br>and later plan my day with my trusty map.</p>
  <p>The lake town atmosphere is different somehow,<br>an infinite horizon just makes me dream and meow.</p>
  <p>Upon waking up from my dream,<br>I'd hop around to get some ice cream.</p>
  <p>Then, once I got some water and food,<br>and I was sure that I was prepared nice and good...</p>
  <p>I'd make the final stretch of the quest,<br>feeling blissful and blessed.</p>

  <p>There is this nice parking lot,<br>where I'd stop to eat the trail mix I bought.</p>
  <p>And there is this silly bench,<br>where my thirst I'd quench.</p>
  <p>It is tilted and very tall,<br>it takes good balance not to fall.</p>

  <p>One time marching around the nearby park,<br>I noticed two older tourist ladies collecting bark.</p>
  <p>Tree lovers I thought,<br>as I entered the parking lot.</p>
  <p>Then I've noticed one of the ladies sniffing or eating a leaf,<br>so I went over there with a look of disbelief.</p>
  <p>And said "Oh my god you guys that's poison ivy, don't touch that."<br>the lady masticating immediately spat.</p>
  <p>And then I quickly hurried away,<br>as they both started making chicken noises and the quiet one started to pray.</p>

  <p>I got some more water out of my car,<br>and returned to my tall bench which wasn't far.</p>
  <p>I laid down,<br>contemplating what I should get next time I am in town.</p>
  <p>Then I dragged myself back to the car,<br>getting ready to drive to the camping area which is near by,</p>
  <p>As I was driving away one of the ladies looked out of her camper with a smile,<br>her expression said, "You got us good, I like your style."</p>

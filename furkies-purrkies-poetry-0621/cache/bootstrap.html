    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I always enjoyed driving to Nordhouse at night,<br>arriving in Ludington by the morning light.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I'd park at the supermarket and nap,<br>and later plan my day with my trusty map.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The lake town atmosphere is different somehow,<br>an infinite horizon just makes me dream and meow.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Upon waking up from my dream,<br>I'd hop around to get some ice cream.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then, once I got some water and food,<br>and I was sure that I was prepared nice and good...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I'd make the final stretch of the quest,<br>feeling blissful and blessed.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is this nice parking lot,<br>where I'd stop to eat the trail mix I bought.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And there is this silly bench,<br>where my thirst I'd quench.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is tilted and very tall,<br>it takes good balance not to fall.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time marching around the nearby park,<br>I noticed two older tourist ladies collecting bark.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Tree lovers I thought,<br>as I entered the parking lot.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then I've noticed one of the ladies sniffing or eating a leaf,<br>so I went over there with a look of disbelief.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And said "Oh my god you guys that's poison ivy, don't touch that."<br>the lady masticating immediately spat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then I quickly hurried away,<br>as they both started making chicken noises and the quiet one started to pray.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I got some more water out of my car,<br>and returned to my tall bench which wasn't far.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I laid down,<br>contemplating what I should get next time I am in town.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then I dragged myself back to the car,<br>getting ready to drive to the camping area which is near by,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As I was driving away one of the ladies looked out of her camper with a smile,<br>her expression said, "You got us good, I like your style."</div>

  "text": "One late afternoon I hopped on my bicycle to ride the trail,\nand returned with an interesting tale.\nFor right where 275 and Michigan meet,\nI found a little bicycle path that's really neat[1].\n\nIt is a huge park that branches out to two more little parks,\nthough they are behind peoples houses and pack a lot of dog barks.\nAll combined together they make a sweet little quest,\nbut make sure to bring plenty of water and rest.\n\nThe main path has little river bridges and lots of really neat sights,\nbut be really careful about ticks and mosquitoes bites.\nAnd that northern stretch under the power line, is a sight to see,\nit is just a barren bumpy grassland without a single tree.\n\nIf you keep going north on Haggerty you'll reach Ford,\nand then you can bicycle back to 275 and get back on board.\nBut I think the woodland trail is the best because there is a lot of shade,\nI imagine that's why it was made.\n\nÂ \nReferences\n[1]: https://goo.gl/maps/En5tWm4Z93mmwtZ28",

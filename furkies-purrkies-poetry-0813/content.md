Humble beginnings in a fancy doodle,
a smiley face, or a neighborhood poodle.

And then you take to your first pen creation,
and get caught by a teacher to a standing ovation.

So as long as you push towards your first reference,
and make copy by graphite paper your preference.

Your future will be crowned by many works,
as you leave behind all the lying dorks.

The bright future is right ahead of you,
so as long as you keep to your path true.

---

Pay no attention to experts or moderators,
as they quickly become power hungry dictators.

Just walk your own path as every artist should,
and trust that all your works are really good.

---

Each time you create a new thing,
you learn something.

That is how you grow in art,
no one is born art-smart.

With each breakthrough,
great ideas will call to you.

---

Depending on ideas you nurture,
you may build enormous ice sculpture.

Two inches at a time like a 3D printer,
with a 2x4 in color lit winter.

Or you may model futuristic 3D scenes,
but 2D paint all the cities and machines.

Or print cathedrals to place them on a mossy hill,
where you will arrange them and take a misty still.

Perhaps it will be music that will touch your soul,
and maybe the Berlin School will become your first goal.

---

Whatever path you take,
know what enormous difference teaching others will make.

Do not forget the doodle you started with,
an donâ€™t let anybody turn you into a myth.

It deeply matters what you will do,
but please remind others that their life is a beautiful work of art too.

  <p>Humble beginnings in a fancy doodle,<br>a smiley face, or a neighborhood poodle.</p>
  <p>And then you take to your first pen creation,<br>and get caught by a teacher to a standing ovation.</p>
  <p>So as long as you push towards your first reference,<br>and make copy by graphite paper your preference.</p>
  <p>Your future will be crowned by many works,<br>as you leave behind all the lying dorks.</p>
  <p>The bright future is right ahead of you,<br>so as long as you keep to your path true.</p>

  <p>Depending on ideas you nurture,<br>you may build enormous ice sculpture.</p>
  <p>Two inches at a time like a 3D printer,<br>with a 2x4 in color lit winter.</p>
  <p>Or you may model futuristic 3D scenes,<br>but 2D paint all the cities and machines.</p>
  <p>Or print cathedrals to place them on a mossy hill,<br>where you will arrange them and take a misty still.</p>
  <p>Perhaps it will be music that will touch your soul,<br>and maybe the Berlin School will become your first goal.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The more I though about adding buttons,<br>the more un-pure my invention had seemed.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So the keyboard and screen is a no go,<br>which brings us to the original problem.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">How do I start, stop, previous, next,<br>and manipulate the volume.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Bluetooth Shutter!<br>you know how people take photos with a little remote?</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Yeah, when I bought one for my phone,<br>I discovered it would mess with other apps.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because that meant, those cheap little remote shutters,<br>simulate standard keyboards.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I love little useless facts like that,<br>this particular one came in handy dandy this weekend.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But it needs to be re-written in node js,<br>as I will add a phone UI, or maybe a hotpot UI that can maybe stream to other phones.</div>

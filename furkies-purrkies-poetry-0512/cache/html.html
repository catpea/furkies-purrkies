  <p>I really like how my portable Linux based player,<br>has neither a screen not keyboard.</p>
  <p>It is just this one chain,<br>Battery, Linux, Audio Card.</p>
  <p>The more I though about adding buttons,<br>the more un-pure my invention had seemed.</p>
  <p>This Is A Digital Audio Player,<br>it is meant to be raw, and clean.</p>

  <p>So the keyboard and screen is a no go,<br>which brings us to the original problem.</p>
  <p>How do I start, stop, previous, next,<br>and manipulate the volume.</p>
  <p>Bluetooth Shutter!<br>you know how people take photos with a little remote?</p>
  <p>Yeah, when I bought one for my phone,<br>I discovered it would mess with other apps.</p>
  <p><img src="/image/poetry-0512-worstphotoever.jpg" alt="Shutter Outtake"></p>
  <p>I could click send on a text message from,<br>10 meters away, useless but amazing.</p>
  <p>Because that meant, those cheap little remote shutters,<br>simulate standard keyboards.</p>
  <p>I love little useless facts like that,<br>this particular one came in handy dandy this weekend.</p>

  <p>I connected it to my Linux based audio player,<br>it took four and a half hours - but I connected it.</p>
  <p>And I witnessed my final version of my MP3 player invention from 1998,<br>the Linux goes into a snazzy jazzy fanny pack, and the Bluetooth remote in my pocket.</p>
  <p>While the buttons don't stick out enough,<br>I can make my own Bluetooth keyboard device, it is no big deal - I like this little shutter.</p>

  <p>I have to read the raw Linux keyboard input to get at the data,<br>I have a perfectly functional prototype downstairs.</p>
  <p>But it needs to be re-written in node js,<br>as I will add a phone UI, or maybe a hotpot UI that can maybe stream to other phones.</p>
  <p>Might as well write it all out in Node.js,<br>and maybe Svelte on the Browser end.</p>

  <p>Beyond simple controls,<br>I'll provide audio feedback when buttons are pushed.</p>
  <p>A long press on one of the buttons can activate the main menu,<br>where I can jam a bunch of crazy Linux things.</p>

  <p>This tiny invention isn't just about Audio,<br>it is about the coming of age of portable GNU/Linux Hardware.</p>
  <p>It is a pocket server,<br>it can do anything, including phone calls over the internet.</p>
  <p>This is a modular computer device,<br>you can plug anything into it, and expand it $20 at a time.</p>
  <p>It can play audio, it can compose songs,<br>it can read you audio books, it can play audio books, or help you record them.</p>
  <p>It can keep you connected to the internet,<br>or it can become the local internet offering whatever it has downloaded.</p>
  <p>Today's phones make a person seem uninterested in real life,<br>connecting these little devices together, however, makes a person seem trendy and clever.</p>

  <p>Personally, I hope we can all work together towards making,<br>Bat Belts socially acceptable, and cool.</p>

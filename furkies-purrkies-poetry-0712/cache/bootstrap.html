    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Ladies have bigger eyes, smaller, (though not shorter) noses, and small lips,<br>and they are squished together towards the bottom.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Germs on the other hand have their eyes bigger, noses shortened,<br>and lips can even stay the same size.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is cuteness for ladies,<br>and humor for gentlemen.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I invite everyone to think of this as a starting point,<br>by the time you reach your tenth caricature, you will have a much better theory than mine.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As with all things there is an exception,<br>and it is wonderfully ridiculous.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Pay close attention to the tool options,<br>as the topmost dropdown lets you choose: Move Pixels, Grow Area, Shrink Area, Swirls, Erase, and Smooth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here you can liquefy a photo, smoothly enlarge eyes,<br>shrink the lips, warp without destruction photo.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here I wanted to explain why my source image, is not perfect,<br>especially to those who are just joining in.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is just photo reference, a quick sketch,<br>to see if the final product will look silly enough.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It does not need to be perfect,<br>because to make a beautiful caricature, we must make a digital painting out of it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not just to paint the shapes of the eyes and nose,<br>it also serves as color reference.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The correct color chose,<br>is as important as the shape.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Wrong colors will absolutely destroy a painting,<br>portraits are special because you always have photo reference.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Lastly, a word on sales,<br>you should be able to sell portraits for $50 dollars.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They may take about five hours at first,<br>but that will eventually become one or two.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It hurts to say it,<br><a href="https://www.qwant.com/?q=where+to+sell+digital+art&client=opensearch&t=web">but the platforms that will sell your art will take a huge cut</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though some platforms will give the customer an option to have your digital paintings framed,<br>the process of framing occurs after the sale is made.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is no warehouse to store your framed paintings,<br>it costs you nothing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The sales platforms will demand exclusive access to your painting,<br>that means you can't sell the same painting on two services, but you can sell different ones.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As to running your own platform,<br>yes, that is why you shouldn't stop at Art.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is not as awful as it sounds,<br>because you can build a program where people upload their photos and watch you work on the paintings of people ahead of them - until it is their turn.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Beyond that, you may with to build an application that will let others join your website,<br>and sell their works, where you can take a small percent of their sales.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The cut that the popular platforms take is too big,<br>so if you just take 5% percent then you can get a lot of sign-ups.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The main problem with hosting your own software are hackers,<br>so you will need to monitor for snooping, and use an off-site credit card processor with its own security, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTc0Zi70AjM">Stripe</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The programming you do on your own is only ever for prototyping and learning,<br>once things get series, you will need investors, and programmers that will do all the programming for you.</div>

  "text": "The Cat Pea Technique is working as well as it should,\nand I just now found a tracing demo showing the Reference Images Tool[1].\nHere a person is tracing the shapes of musical instruments,\nthrough a transparent reference image.\nI don't know if it is mentioned that the color picker tool,\nwill pick original colors from the reference image even though it has been made transparent.\nThis tool is both for tracing shapes,\nand picking the correct colors.\n\nA lot of people ridicule the idea[2],\nothers ridicule people that ridicule the idea[3].\nDiscouraging people from art, is a very toxic thing to do[4],\nso this fantastic art technique, also doubles as method for detecting all the elitist, bat shit crazy monsters in the room...\nNo one is allowed to tell someone that they are not an artist,\nit is like asking someone to quit laughing - art is a very important part of the Human Condition.\n\nAbove all else; this meowwrvelous technique is a REAL teacher,\nbecause the more you work with it the more you will be able to handle[5].\nYou simply become more curious about art,\nthe more you learn about it, for real.\n\nNow onto the review,\nof the first steps I took.\n\nThe idea that all my artworks should be square,\nin part because I can make a bigger and more interesting square with each nine works - works.\nIf you absolutely need a rectangle,\nuse up six of your squares, a 2x3, this way you can still continue the tile work.\nThis will enhance your portfolio,\nand if you make your coffee book, or art-book square, it will absolutely add to the beauty.\n\nMy idea of using animator pink as a background color,\nmay not be so good.\nI would still encourage considering such an exploit,\nbut also caution that if you invest yourself in keeping to a single background color...\nNone of your works can touch the edge of the canvas,\nespecially the bottom edge as the case is with portraits.\nWhen I finish a portrait I want to share it with the world,\nI don't want to search for a photo of a frame or a graphic motif to prevent the work from touching the edges.\n\nMy caricature or low-brow art style creation system works,\nI used it twice.\nBut realistic portraits are so much more beautiful,\nthat I can't bring myself to do caricatures.\nThough I did discover that once you paint a realistic portrait,\nit is then very easy to extend it into the world of low brow pop surrealism.\nIt is more respectful, however, to just give the person their painting,\nwithout messing with any of the shapes.\nSo a caricature or a low brow piece; is a secondary work of art;\nthink of it as a cute companion to the full portrait - it is sure to make the subject smile.\n\nNow onto the stylization components,\nwhere we enhance photos.\nWe all know that putting a little white reflection dot in the eye, makes it look more realistic,\nbut you should also add a transparent layer reflecting something like the sky of pavement.\nThe shape of this reflection should probably be circular,\nin one of my works it actually has the shape of bushes that are reflected in the animal eyes.\nBeyond the reflection of the light,\nthere is also a mirror image reflected by the eyeball, and you don't need to stop there.\nFor one you can add more light, and you don't have to have that light,\nmess with shadows in other parts of the painting.\nCreate art for beauty's sake[6],\nnot to be technical.\n\nSkin has reflections too, and the best place to see that is 3D models in blender,\nthe highlight occurs at the tip of the nose, cheekbone, lip, upper lip, forehead.\nBe mindful of it when searching through other people's art,\nonce you begin noticing it, adding it into your own works will become second nature.\nIt makes the digital portrait come alive,\nand if it does not work for your client, you can always turn it off.\n\nExplore selective focus and tilt shift effects,\nwhen painting on a physical canvas you have to commit to certain things.\nYou can't explore past a certain point,\nbecause there are points of no return, where you can't click undo.\nOn a digital canvas,\nyou can blur a layer to see what happens.\n\nI am currently learning fabric folds and,\nusing sunlight with darker or dim photo-reference.\nIt is easier than it sounds, and like my caricatures,\nI will assemble everything in GIMP via photo editing...\nBut this is also an area of painting where I will apply a custom color-theme to paintings,\nbe it changing the color temperature, or using a new palette.\nIt is firmly seated in a sturdy photo reference foundation,\nthere is still no chance of getting stuck here...\nBut there is light and color here,\nthat is not of this world.\n\nAgain, you are an artist, stretch a transparent reference image over your canvas,\nand let it take you on an adventure towards worlds and universes of your own creation.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCVJyFHcb38\n[2]: https://youtu.be/0uCH2z_zLmc?t=422\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZKUKCnkZ6E\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKXVT_EOKOE\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U_h3fw7VRc\n[6]: https://youtu.be/UmOQ5zwiI90?t=2550",

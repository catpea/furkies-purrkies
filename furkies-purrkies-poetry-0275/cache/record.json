meaningful, it changes you and others for better, and your book will be irreplaceable and beloved by many.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And, no, it is foolish to think that you must become an author to write a book, there are too many of those books already,</p>\n  <p>you only need to become wise to write, there are no critics here, as you cry, the reader will cry, as you climb the next mountain, the reader will triumph with you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Take your self-education to the trails,</p>\n  <p>the nature will help you slow down and connect with the spirits of the authors stored within the books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t worry, it will be OK,</p>\n  <p>so as long as all your steps count as a triumph, your growing up will become an upward slope, and your life will eventually become as beautiful as you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And the last thing a Great Being discovers,</p>\n  <p>is the answer to their first big question &quot;Who am I?&quot;, it will all lay open as you look back from your golden age.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your path to wisdom intertwined with adventure and great discoveries,</p>\n  <p>and bears, and dunes, and Fox Fire, and rain and snow, and softness of moss, and endless seas of fern, open like all the great ideas behind all the most beloved of

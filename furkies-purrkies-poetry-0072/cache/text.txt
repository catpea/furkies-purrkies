We must make time, to enlarge our view,
and in everything we do, we must first think things through.
Above all, to thine own self be true,
but also your own world, should fit like a good shoe.

With each step you took your mind grew,
with all new things, we never really start anew.
Where ever we go, whatever we go through,
we learn and our wisdom evolves, as we continue.

Sure, sometimes it feels like we don't know what to do,
but when you get sad, the whole Universe becomes slightly more blue,
We may not know exactly what you are going through,
but many of us have been there, we too got stuck until we grew.

Many great beings get hurt, but all plow on through,
you are not alone, in our own thoughts, we sit right next to you.
Please push trough the pain, and look through the zoo,
when all is writ, and said and done, we all still need you,

There is a blinding beauty to who you already are - I wish you knew,
with each step forward, you become a brighter star, and we love you.
Don't worry, so as long as to your own self you stay true,
it will all pass, and when looking back you'll say - "I Grew."

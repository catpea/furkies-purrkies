    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Our minds are really powerful,<br>and always work to ensure we are one.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You have to carefully go back in your imagination,<br>and divide what you really would have done from what you were made to do.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They won't teach you this in school,<br>and many young people are constantly lied to so that they are more obedient.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But growing up, and decision making, requires wisdom, truth, and authenticity,<br>you don't want to become an adult who regrets their past.</div>

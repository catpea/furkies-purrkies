Theory, is useful after you don't need it,
don't do things because others tell you to do them.

You are too unique, you are too grand, too unstoppable, too unbreakable,
to fit any theory.

Some theories are broken... college is broken,
future expects more of you, you will have to show evidence of exceptional ability.

Some theories are misleading,
and you end up in a place you didn't really want.

And when you turn around for answers,
you get the worst of them all, a real curse.

You hear,
"How were we supposed to know?".

Listen to good advice,
but also ask your Elder Self what regrets you feel, and the sands of time, and the butterflies wing.

Do not follow,
lead the way.

Did you know, you don't even need music theory to make music, you don't need to practice the piano,
and train your fingers, we have computers now.

Sure, Music Theory maybe easy to learn,
and it is easy to spot music by another person that uses the theory.

It is shocking to see a composer,
that does not use the theory, it is outrageous, out of control.

If you don't employ proper use of scales,
the Noble Tuba Men, will run out of octaves and semitones.

You will make everyone angry,
and most of your orchestra will walk out on you, some may cry, some will be angry.

Few will stay,
just to see "How dare you?".

But you must dare,
you have to.

You have to begin composing,
before you learn the damn theory.

Your greatest energy,
your raw power, lies within the younger you, the unchained melody of you.

You have to sing free,
you have to scribble incomprehensible notes, madly, upon a roof in winter, bareFOOT.

You must resist the teachers, maybe permanently so,
or you will end up, a mere part of the orchestra.

Because you must reign alone.

We have to search for multiple ways of understanding the world for what it really is,
not just listen to what others are trying to sell us, but rise in all ways possible.

If we listened, to what others wanted to teach us...
humanity would still be stuck in the worst parts of dark ages.

And invent your own, and don't stop, ever.

People will misunderstand you,
it is OK, they do it for making friends with other people that feel the same.

And they wouldn't have understood you even if you did what they wanted you to do,
but what kind of a person would have been then?

What is the theory there?
good grades, good college, good job, good memories, and good bye, because we do not live in that kind of world.

We are born into a cosmos of infinity,
we are not to cage ourselves.

We are to break away,
and change the world in part for the good of future generations.

We are to live a Wise and Inspiring,
Noble and Beautiful Life of Infinite Complexity.

Live as if you were to inspire all the future generations to Greatness,
and begin by asking your Elder and Wise Self, what your regrets are.

Live and Compose Beautifully,
and may your noblest ideas spread to no end.

  "text": "Theory, is useful after you don't need it,\ndon't do things because others tell you to do them.\nYou are too unique, you are too grand, too unstoppable, too unbreakable,\nto fit any theory.\nSome theories are broken... college is broken,\nfuture expects more of you, you will have to show evidence of exceptional ability.\nSome theories are misleading,\nand you end up in a place you didn't really want.\nAnd when you turn around for answers,\nyou get the worst of them all, a real curse.\nYou hear,\n\"How were we supposed to know?\".\nListen to good advice,\nbut also ask your Elder Self what regrets you feel, and the sands of time, and the butterflies wing.\nDo not follow,\nlead the way.\n\nDid you know, you don't even need music theory to make music, you don't need to practice the piano,\nand train your fingers, we have computers now.\nSure, Music Theory maybe easy to learn,\nand it is easy to spot music by another person that uses the theory.\nIt is shocking to see a composer,\nthat does not use the theory, it is outrageous, out of control.\nIf you don't employ proper use of scales,\nthe Noble Tuba Men, will run out of octaves and semitones.\nYou will make everyone angry,\nand most of your orchestra will walk out on you, some may cry, some will be angry.\nFew will stay,\njust to see \"How dare you?\".\n\nBut you must dare,\nyou have to.\nYou have to begin composing,\nbefore you learn the damn theory.\nYour greatest energy,\nyour raw power, lies within the younger you, the unchained melody of you.\nYou have to sing free,\nyou have to scribble incomprehensible notes, madly, upon a roof in winter, bareFOOT.\nYou must resist the teachers, maybe permanently so,\nor you will end up, a mere part of the orchestra.\n\nWhy?[1]\nBecause you must reign alone[2].\nWe have to search for multiple ways of understanding the world for what it really is[3],\nnot just listen to what others are trying to sell us, but rise in all ways possible[4].\nIf we listened, to what others wanted to teach us...\nhumanity would still be stuck in the worst parts of dark ages.\nLeave. The. Old Theory. Alone.[5]\nAnd invent your own[6], and don't stop, ever.\n\nPeople will misunderstand you,\nit is OK, they do it for making friends with other people that feel the same.\nAnd they wouldn't have understood you even if you did what they wanted you to do,\nbut what kind of a person would have been then?\nWhat is the theory there?\ngood grades, good college, good job, good memories, and good bye, because we do not live in that kind of world[7].\nWe are born into a cosmos of infinity,\nwe are not to cage ourselves.\nWe are to break away[8],\nand change the world in part for the good of future generations.\nWe are to live a Wise and Inspiring,\nNoble and Beautiful Life of Infinite Complexity.\nLive as if you were to inspire all the future generations to Greatness,\nand begin by asking your Elder and Wise Self, what your regrets are.\nLive and Compose Beautifully,\nand may your noblest ideas spread to no end.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCb0TsSIqI0\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAgdd2VqLVc\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52P3aX_6EqA\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KhwjboHHWw\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqODySSxYpc\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWLp7lBomW8\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJcsL7vyrk\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw4Le_EEI8w",

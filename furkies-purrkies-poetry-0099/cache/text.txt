No one regrets becoming wise,
no adult ever wished to stay a child.

All the grownups,
embrace the powers they developed.

You can see it in the way
they Nobly & Calmly carry themselves.

The time meant for your growing up,
should not be disrupted in any way.

Growing up,
is not as random as it seems.

Your own observations,
will create questions.

Questions will sprout affinities,
and affinities will draw you towards places with answers.

Growing up, begins with simple questions, and simple answers,
but we amass a library of twisty little passages.

Later in life,
we apply those passages other things.

We face the Universe,
and there are consequences to all our actions.

What do we do when the bullies come?
We learn to practice restraint, so that we don't end up the snarling beasts they are.

What do we do, when people belittle us, step on us?
We expand our own sense of Dignity, and Nobility into an Independent Universe free of their flaws and limitations.

And how do we stand up against Isolation, or being Cast Away?
With Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage and Honor.

The meaning of life?
The meaning of life is always found in Love.

And how do we learn to see and rise and better ourselves?
With Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism;

My Dear Friends,

Your growing up,
is the very Formation of you.

This is not a process that anyone is allowed to interrupt,
you are not allowed to have anybody step in your way.

It is like learning to walk,
no one is allowed to push you to the ground.

I don't know if there is anything more sacred,
than your growing up.

You must learn to push what is not important away,
you must get comfortable with not following.

And you must stand your ground, or walk your path...
You must, lead.

You must make sure that you rise a little higher each and every day,
and that each day adds to the previous.

Growing Up Is Sacred,
It Is Your Right.

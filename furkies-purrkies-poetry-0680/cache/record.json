saying.\nAnd perhaps visualize the Twin Paradox[7],\non an ark accelerating at a reasonable although constant rate[8].\nYou will brush up again dozens,\nof unsolved mysteries[9], that you can have your computer solve for you.\n\nWithout any additional tools,\nyou have mastered your native language.\nStories, Poems, Sentences, Words, Letters, and Punctuation,\nis not something that you are born with.\nYou are such a powerful Genius,\nthat you master it all without thinking about it too much.\nBut notice that you are surrounded by language,\nsurrounded by closed captions, books, and various other text.\nYou are surrounded by people voicing words,\npeople creating new sentences.\nThat is exactly why you need a simple programming language,\nto study physics.\nYou have to build a pixel star ship, or ark,\nand spin it around singularities.\n\nOh an by the way, don't worry about mathematical formulas,\nit is an old language meant for paper.\nReal mathematics,\nis translated to a simple programming language[10].\nProgramming languages are just tools,\nlike with tools, you only learn them when you have a use for them.\n\nA Beat Sequencer[11] is a tiny example of a language,\nthere is this loop that goes in circles that triggers events.\nIt is just a grid where columns light up every beat,\nand if there is something in a column that is lit, it plays.\nThis is a visual programming a language,\nand I invite you to explore a more complex Visual Programming language by looking at Nodes in Blender[12].\nBlender will help you see UNIX Pipes[13],\nand later then you can install Termux on your Phone[14] and use Bash[15] and Node Streams[16].\n\nLearning programming is easy as long as you set meaningful goals,\nrather than just saving a file build a super tiny WikiWiki.\nYou'll explore writing to files,\nwhen save is pressed on the edit page.\nAll computers have a silly private internet address,\ncalled the localhost with the IP 127.0.0.1.\nWhen building an HTTP server you have to give it a port,\nsuch as 8080.\nby going to localhost at port 8080,\nyou will see your server output.\nOften Hello World at first,\nbut when a request is made to your server it includes the file path.\nSo is someone requests /main you print the home page,\nif someone goes to main/edit you expose contents of main in a text area.\nA tiny little wiki,\nis a magical teacher.\nYou can use express.js for your experiments[17],\nit has plenty of snippets to copy, and many express.js tutorial videos to watch[18]\n\nPlease,\ndon't let anybody trick you into thinking that you are not a Brilliant Genius.\nTeachers are doing that,\nbecause they want to hide they don't know how to teach.\nThey hide behind tests, and finals they rush,\nand behind the ever changing flow of students.\nYou must learn on your own,\nyou must accept the responsibility for your own education.\nIt is a beautiful adventure.\nthere is a million directions to pick from.\nYou can pause curiosities you conquered for years,\nand you always get learn at your own pace.\nAnd you can change whatever it is you are curious about,\nanytime you want.\nYou are your own best teacher,\nand school is the worst.\nDo you see?\nyou are a Brilliant Genius.\nYou've been a Brilliant Genius,\nall along.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ebQK7evbw\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUVSHDbAeM\n[3]:

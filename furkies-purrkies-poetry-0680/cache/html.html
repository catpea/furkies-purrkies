  <p>You must not let the world convince you,<br>that you are not a Brilliant Genius.</p>
  <p>In fact, the definition of Brilliance and Genius,<br>is hinged upon you not letting anyone to take either from you.</p>

  <p>If you need a bit oh help,<br>Einstein wasn't smarter, and neither was Hawking.</p>
  <p>They loved being thought about that way,<br>because it made them, celebrities.</p>
  <p>But they were just like you,<br>except that they did not let anything crush them.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ebQK7evbw">Einstein by subtle analogy</a>,<br>used trains.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUVSHDbAeM">Hawking by subtle analogy</a>,<br>used the clock.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70MQ-FugwbI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM">And unlike you</a>,<br>both of them were limited by paper math.</p>
  <p>You can use computers,<br>that will do the math for you.</p>
  <p>If you just simulate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVlUy77d-MU">SETI</a> with pixels,<br>to for example figure out what the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s1qTUqOv88">Drake Equation</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc">Fermi Paradox</a> is actually saying.</p>
  <p>And perhaps visualize the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRuVGOm7560">Twin Paradox</a>,<br>on an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB91TJHa-NY">ark accelerating at a reasonable although constant rate</a>.</p>
  <p>You will brush up again dozens,<br>of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4JXjYCgQK4">unsolved mysteries</a>, that you can have your computer solve for you.</p>

  <p>Without any additional tools,<br>you have mastered your native language.</p>
  <p>Stories, Poems, Sentences, Words, Letters, and Punctuation,<br>is not something that you are born with.</p>
  <p>You are such a powerful Genius,<br>that you master it all without thinking about it too much.</p>
  <p>But notice that you are surrounded by language,<br>surrounded by closed captions, books, and various other text.</p>
  <p>You are surrounded by people voicing words,<br>people creating new sentences.</p>
  <p>That is exactly why you need a simple programming language,<br>to study physics.</p>
  <p>You have to build a pixel star ship, or ark,<br>and spin it around singularities.</p>

  <p>Oh an by the way, don't worry about mathematical formulas,<br>it is an old language meant for paper.</p>
  <p>Real mathematics,<br>is <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">translated to a simple programming language</a>.</p>
  <p>Programming languages are just tools,<br>like with tools, you only learn them when you have a use for them.</p>

  <p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzYA1i9SZ8A">Beat Sequencer</a> is a tiny example of a language,<br>there is this loop that goes in circles that triggers events.</p>
  <p>It is just a grid where columns light up every beat,<br>and if there is something in a column that is lit, it plays.</p>
  <p>This is a visual programming a language,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52UYqe3zdxQ">I invite you to explore a more complex Visual Programming language by looking at Nodes in Blender</a>.</p>
  <p>Blender will help you see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKzonnwoR2I">UNIX Pipes</a>,<br>and later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I1LmWhY9Ig">then you can install Termux on your Phone</a> and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-F3YLd6oMw">Bash</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlybFFMXXmQ">Node Streams</a>.</p>

  <p>Learning programming is easy as long as you set meaningful goals,<br>rather than just saving a file build a super tiny WikiWiki.</p>
  <p>You'll explore writing to files,<br>when save is pressed on the edit page.</p>
  <p>All computers have a silly private internet address,<br>called the localhost with the IP 127.0.0.1.</p>
  <p>When building an HTTP server you have to give it a port,<br>such as 8080.</p>
  <p>by going to localhost at port 8080,<br>you will see your server output.</p>
  <p>Often Hello World at first,<br>but when a request is made to your server it includes the file path.</p>
  <p>So is someone requests /main you print the home page,<br>if someone goes to main/edit you expose contents of main in a text area.</p>
  <p>A tiny little wiki,<br>is a magical teacher.</p>
  <p>You can <a href="https://expressjs.com/">use express.js for your experiments</a>,<br>it has plenty of snippets to copy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=express.js+tutorial">and many express.js tutorial videos to watch</a></p>

  <p>Please,<br>don't let anybody trick you into thinking that you are not a Brilliant Genius.</p>
  <p>Teachers are doing that,<br>because they want to hide they don't know how to teach.</p>
  <p>They hide behind tests, and finals they rush,<br>and behind the ever changing flow of students.</p>
  <p>You must learn on your own,<br>you must accept the responsibility for your own education.</p>
  <p>It is a beautiful adventure.<br>there is a million directions to pick from.</p>
  <p>You can pause curiosities you conquered for years,<br>and you always get learn at your own pace.</p>
  <p>And you can change whatever it is you are curious about,<br>anytime you want.</p>
  <p>You are your own best teacher,<br>and school is the worst.</p>
  <p>Do you see?<br>you <strong>are</strong> a Brilliant Genius.</p>
  <p>You've been a Brilliant Genius,<br>all along.</p>

of effort,</p>\n  <p>they are using grades to make you feel bad, so that you will memorize and pretend to learn, so that everyone keeps getting paid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That is what the teacher wants,</p>\n  <p>put food on the table.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They don&apos;t know what it means to get bad grades,</p>\n  <p>the fact that they are a

strange that someone solving a math problem with memorized formulas, thinks that they understand it - they don&apos;t,</p>\n  <p>they must understand how the formulas work, and it is easy and beautiful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To begin learning mathematics for real, you need to even out the playing field with a simple programming language,</p>\n  <p>because to quote <a href=\"https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code\">Math As Code</a>, &quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So, you aren&apos;t even learning real math,</p>\n  <p>and beyond that as you create or re-create your formulas in a simple programming language, it makes sense to plug them in, and create interactive visualizations.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And of course, before you start learning math, you need a reason to lean math, which would be creating computer games,</p>\n  <p>designing Screen Savers, Music Visualizations, Generative Art, or Generative Music, even stuff for making videos.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>More than that, you can&apos;t learn math when someone tells you to,</p>\n  <p>your mind has to be ready, and that may take a long time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And you need to see the full picture, because as fun as Generative Art is,</p>\n  <p>you need to know why you need it...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The reason why you need generative art,</p>\n  <p>is so that you may exhibit your works at Guggenheim, creating another product line, or helping students learn how to be more like you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The point of it all, is to build a breathtaking portfolio,</p>\n  <p>describing a series of companies that you built.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I can&apos;t

Cubicle? ... College, Brand Name University, and Lab?</p>\n  <p>And for how long, for ever? In a cubicle? Or is it until we start dreaming about opening up our own business - because we can do that as teenagers, and actually learn something for real in the process.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We are each unique, we have different curiosities that mark natural starting points for real education,</p>\n  <p>but they will all lead to art, computers, and sciences, AND in a way that actually empowers you, makes you more powerful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bad grades, are just a sign that schools only care about funding,</p>\n  <p>and teachers only care about getting you to pretend to know, so that they get paid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bad grades are not real,</p>\n  <p>they just reveal the reality of fake education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are just as smart as everyone else,</p>\n  <p>and your rejection of blind memorization is a sign of and affinity for great authenticity, I&apos;ll let you discover where that will take you, on your own.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For all the naysayers, and apologetic teachers with great excuses,</p>\n  <p>the principals, and the students with perfect grades, I understand what you are saying.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But that is not worth a single student crying her self to sleep at night,</p>\n  <p>because her grades and teachers are trying to convince her she is stupid, because she is failing your stupid make-believe schools that will lead all into debt and stress.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I honestly believe that people with bad grades,</p>\n  <p>mature faster, and are in a way gifted, but schools trick them and show them that they have no future, and sometimes this robs them of their beautiful gift.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All the schools are not worth,</p>\n  <p>a single student crying her self to sleep.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All of these thoughts can be easily dismissed as a conspiracy theory,</p>\n  <p>until we rephrase them as accusations of fraud.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So,</p>\n  <p>let us ask.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Why are schools getting funding,</p>\n  <p>when graduating student do not feel that they have received a real education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Why are grades being used on students,</p>\n  <p>when they do more damage than good.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Why is there a standard curriculum,</p>\n  <p>when everybody has different curiosities, a different pace of learning, and holds a unique constellation of knowledge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>How can an institution refer to it self as a school,</p>\n  <p>when it causes stress that often leads to tears, and low self esteem.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Furthermore,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Standardized schools have a tendency to convince students to spend their parents money or go into debt from overpriced college,</p>\n  <p>a paid education, with unforgivable debt, with a significant percentage of students pushed into drugs and alcohol.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The jobs that college graduates get are often less than advertised,</p>\n  <p>terrible job interviews, with bad starting salaries, and awful entry level positions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All of this shows signs of fraud, neglect, and lies, and more lies.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All of this can be repaired with a Personalized Education with the Aid of Computers,</p>\n  <p>and with a focus on building small companies that will help the students to financial independence, rather than debt.</p>\n</div>",

 <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But schools require funding,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">part of that

class=\"paragraph\">money.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Everyone suddenly was a teacher,</div>\n  <div

a school anymore,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">this is a business, all the teachers now take a paycheck home.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom:

 <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So now, we have a school, that needs funding,</div>\n  <div

tests,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">setup in a way where majority passes by memorization.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And then there are those who assume that teachers are there to teach,</div>\n  <div

<div class=\"paragraph\">The grades, are actually a performance score of how well the teacher is teaching,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and they have not a darn thing to do with any of the

can't teach, because that would mean addressing every student,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that is just not possible, and they would rather get a job elsewhere.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">More importantly, they won't know, they won't even care, when you do find something that you like,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they will take that away you, because there is no time for you to learn, you have to pass tests that are in class right now.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If you don't pass the standardized tests that are an insult to your uniqueness, your predispositions, talents and creativity,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the teacher will have to be transferred to another school as a

  "text": "You have to punch through what everyone else is saying,\nif something feels wrong, you walk, you get out, you don't let people push you.\n\nLong time ago, we had these little schools,\nthat taught reading, writing, and arithmetic.\nAnd people loved them, everyone loved and admired them,\nit was a true gift, and teachers were True Angels of Wisdom.\n\nBut schools require funding,\npart of that funding is paying teachers.\nAnd what that means is:\nmoney.\nEveryone suddenly was a teacher,\nand to optimize money, testing, testing, testing.\nThis is not a school anymore,\nthis is a business, all the teachers now take a paycheck home.\n\nThe concept of grades is very iffy, very lazy, a teacher should talk to the parent.\nif grades used to work, then maybe they didn't matter much, somehow.\nBut over time,\nwith everyone busy optimizing things to get or make more money.\nWith schools everywhere needing funding,\nwith teachers needing to get paid.\nNobody would have noticed,\nwhen grades became everything.\nSame with tests, nobody noticed when lectures became too abstract,\nand people just started memorizing for tests to get good grades.\n\nSo now, we have a school, that needs funding,\nteachers that need to get paid.\nAnd lectures and tests,\nsetup in a way where majority passes by memorization.\n\nAnd then there are those who assume that teachers are there to teach,\nand that the abstract disconnected lectures actually make sense.\nThey don't know everyone is memorizing,\nthey assume they are just not smart enough.\nC, and D, an occasional B+. but mostly Cs,\nit wouldn't occur to them that teachers are looking at other classes and give the same grade.\nNor would it occur to them that statistically a certain number of students,\nshould have bad grades, and the teacher will make that happen as not to stick out.\n\nAnd then there is the big one, the biggie,\nthe one that nobody talks about, that inconvenient fact.\nThe grades, are actually a performance score of how well the teacher is teaching,\nand they have not a darn thing to do with any of the students.\n\nYou can't learn disconnected facts,\nyou can only temporarily memorize them.\nYour grades are are reflection of how inclined you are to participate in a memorization charade,\nthat fetches the teacher money, and keeps your school operating.\nThey have to get paid,\nthey have to put food on their table.\nThey can't teach, because that would mean addressing every student,\nthat is just not possible, and they would rather get a job elsewhere.\nMore importantly, they won't know, they won't even care, when you do find something that you like,\nthey will take that away you, because there is no time for you to learn, you have to pass tests that are in class right now.\n\nIf you don't pass the standardized tests that are an insult to your uniqueness, your predispositions, talents and creativity,\nthe teacher will have to be transferred to another school as a lemon[1] and that makes them look bad.\nHow dare you,\nhow dare you little child.\nThey will behave high and mighty,\nwhile selling your mind for a paycheck.\nDo yo see?\ndo you see?\nThe tests were never a judgment of you,\nthey are just the simplest way to track who the worst teachers are.\nEverything that surrounds you in school is created with the least amount of effort,\nthey are using grades to make you feel bad, so that you will memorize and pretend to learn, so that everyone keeps getting paid.\nThat is what the teacher wants,\nput food on the table.\nThey don't know what it means to get bad grades,\nthe fact that they are a teachers shows that they crammed, memorized and probably were proud of their meaningless grades.\n\nIt is so strange that someone solving a math problem with memorized formulas, thinks that they understand it - they don't,\nthey must understand how the formulas work, and it is easy and beautiful.\nTo begin learning mathematics for real, you need to even out the playing field with a simple programming language,\nbecause to quote Math As Code[2], \"Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc).\"\nSo, you aren't even learning real math,\nand beyond that as you create or re-create your formulas in a simple programming language, it makes sense to plug them in, and create interactive visualizations.\nAnd of course, before you start learning math, you need a reason to lean math, which would be creating computer games,\ndesigning Screen Savers, Music Visualizations, Generative Art, or Generative Music, even stuff for making videos.\nMore than that, you can't learn math when someone tells you to,\nyour mind has to be ready, and that may take a long time.\nAnd you need to see the full picture, because as fun as Generative Art is,\nyou need to know why you need it...\nThe reason why you need generative art,\nis so that you may exhibit your works at Guggenheim, creating another product line, or helping students learn how to be more like you.\nThe point of it all, is to build a breathtaking portfolio,\ndescribing a series of companies that you built.\nI can't even imagine what schools must think we are,\nfor them to treat us the way they do, and where exactly are they directing us?\nCollege, Debt and Cubicle? ... College, Brand Name University, and Lab?\nAnd for how long, for ever? In a cubicle? Or is it until we start dreaming about opening up our own business - because we can do that as teenagers, and actually learn something for real in the process.\n\nWe are each unique, we have different curiosities that mark natural starting points for real education,\nbut they will all lead to art, computers, and sciences, AND in a way that actually empowers you, makes you more powerful.\nBad grades, are just a sign that schools only care about funding,\nand teachers only care about getting you to pretend to know, so that they get paid.\nBad grades are not real,\nthey just reveal the reality of fake education.\nYou are just as smart as everyone else,\nand your rejection of blind memorization is a sign of and affinity for great authenticity, I'll let you discover where that will take you, on your own.\n\nFor all the naysayers, and apologetic teachers with great excuses,\nthe principals, and the students with perfect grades, I understand what you are saying.\nBut that is not worth a single student crying her self to sleep at night,\nbecause her grades and teachers are trying to convince her she is stupid, because she is failing your stupid make-believe schools that will lead all into debt and stress.\nI honestly believe that people with bad grades,\nmature faster, and are in a way gifted, but schools trick them and show them that they have no future, and sometimes this robs them of their beautiful gift.\nAll the schools are not worth,\na single student crying her self to sleep.\n\nAll of these thoughts can be easily dismissed as a conspiracy theory,\nuntil we rephrase them as accusations of fraud.\nSo,\nlet us ask.\nWhy are schools getting funding,\nwhen graduating student do not feel that they have received a real education.\nWhy are grades being used on students,\nwhen they do more damage than good.\nWhy is there a standard curriculum,\nwhen everybody has different curiosities, a different pace of learning, and holds a unique constellation of knowledge.\nHow can an institution refer to it self as a school,\nwhen it causes stress that often leads to tears, and low self esteem.\nFurthermore,\nStandardized schools have a tendency to convince students to spend their parents money or go into debt from overpriced college,\na paid education, with unforgivable debt, with a significant percentage of students pushed into drugs and alcohol.\nThe jobs that college graduates get are often less than advertised,\nterrible job interviews, with bad starting salaries, and awful entry level positions.\nAll of this shows signs of fraud, neglect, and lies, and more lies.\n\nAll of this can be repaired with a Personalized Education with the Aid of Computers,\nand with a focus on building small companies that will help the students to financial independence, rather than debt.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6uHUx728\n[2]: https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code",

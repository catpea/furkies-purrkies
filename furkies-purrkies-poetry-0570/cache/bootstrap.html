    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The law is incapable of processing lack of education, group-think, clouded minds,<br>and the law should be applied to politicians more than to those who are uneducated due to political failings, but that is not the case.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Before we rebuild criminal justice, and comprehend the simple primitive notion that we must replace prisons with real schools, something these kids didn't have,<br>and get to the more complicated stuff, where we actually begin seeing criminals as people in urgent need of real help, not in need of sick punishment that will unravel their minds further.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We need real schools,<br>in 30 years time, humanity must see it self as one family, because half of us will need help.</div>

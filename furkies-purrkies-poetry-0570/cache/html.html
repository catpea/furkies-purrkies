  <p>Just like it is not possible to stop a war the day it begins,<br>wars and disasters are prevented 30 years in the past - and that means now.</p>

  <p>We are the ones,<br>that are supposed to deal with the terrible things that are coming for the future generations.</p>
  <p>That is how the Human Family,<br>helps each other, across borders - including the border of time that divides generations.</p>
  <p>The future generations can't stop disasters once they begin,<br>and it won't take them very long to understand that.</p>
  <p>Let me repeat that, time and again,<br>disasters are not stopped in the present, but 30 years in the past.</p>
  <p>If you want to stop a war in 2050,<br>you build schools in 2020.</p>
  <p>If you want to stop a Humanitarian Crisis in 2050,<br>you find a solution in 2020.</p>

  <p>Politicians have their hands tied,<br>just as much as teachers - they are both pretty ineffective where real problems and real solutions are concerned.</p>
  <p>Real school,<br>is where we learn to invent and build what will be needed.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m8as2cM_4Y">Improvement to farming will go a long way in short term</a>,<br>but what will need to happen is migration.</p>
  <p>We are one family, we are one people,<br>if our family in Africa can't stay there anymore because of climate, then we help the move north.</p>
  <p>Melting permafrost, something that we failed to prevent already,<br>will open up new areas for farming, that is a pretty good place for our family to move into.</p>

  <p>If this was something that needed to happen in 2020 right now and not in 30 years,<br>you can see how today's uneducated people would try to stop it.</p>
  <p>They don't know they are uneducated,<br>they don't know their hate is fueled by lack of education - even though many are somewhat aware they've never read a book for real.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ4GjzuM72s">And very few will be awaken to how indoctrination warped their minds before they go too far</a>,<br>we are all very beautiful, but we can be warped by culture and indoctrination into acting against our family, and then snatched by a infantile criminal justice system incapable of helping.</p>
  <p>The law is incapable of processing lack of education, group-think, clouded minds,<br>and the law should be applied to politicians more than to those who are uneducated due to political failings, but that is not the case.</p>
  <p>Before we rebuild criminal justice, and comprehend the simple primitive notion that we must replace prisons with real schools, something these kids didn't have,<br>and get to the more complicated stuff, where we actually begin seeing criminals as people in urgent need of real help, not in need of sick punishment that will unravel their minds further.</p>
  <p>We need real schools,<br>in 30 years time, humanity must see it self as one family, because half of us will need help.</p>
  <p>Children are not born hating each other because of color, or the place they were born to,<br>it is the uneducated that spread the divisions.</p>
  <p>To fix the hate that currently makes it impossible to help billions of people out of the upcoming climate crisis,<br>we need real schools, and real education.</p>
  <p>It is the same thing that inmates need,<br>it is the same thing that people of hate need.</p>
  <p>It is the same thing that normal people need,<br>it is the same thing that children need.</p>
  <p>It is the same thing we need,<br>real schools and real education is what the world really needs.</p>

  <p>You are right to sense that there are very few stable answers here,<br>that is because we didn't get the education that is worthy of us.</p>
  <p>Let me show you, you are now in a nation somewhere, one that is encircled by a political border,<br>and you see absolutely nothing wrong with that - even though I just told you three billion people will need help in 30 years.</p>

  <p>It is not just knowledge that we need,<br>and it is not just knowledge that we get when we learn.</p>
  <p>Our mind accumulates the structures of the things we learn about,<br>and is able to dynamically apply the structures to new problems, by a subtle analogy.</p>
  <p>That is wisdom,<br>beautifully thinking by subtle analogy.</p>
  <p>And then what follows wisdom is Greatness<br>greatness is something else.</p>
  <p>Greatness is never what you expect,<br>it will always make you feel small.</p>
  <p>It is hearing the words <a href="https://youtu.be/WJ4GjzuM72s?t=97">"But I want you all to know that this is not me"</a>,<br>and actually understanding that as our failure, to help the children grow into Great Human Beings - which is the real and only solution to the upcoming global crisis.</p>
  <p>In order to help all those in need in 30 years,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw">we must look past our hate or fear of those fractured by lack of education</a>, and understand what "But I want you all to know that this is not me" really means.</p>
  <p>It means real school, real education, meaningful and real books,<br>life changing lectures that transform the students from whatever they were born into, into lovers of wisdom, and great beings that change the world for better.</p>
  <p>Please, find a way to understand that even though the climate crisis will begin in 30 years,<br>the time to fix it, is right now.</p>
  <p>We must build real schools,<br>and ensure real education.</p>
  <p>We must become great beings, and erase all divisions, and all borders,<br>we must understand that this one world is for us all.</p>
  <p>We must prevent the suffering of billions,<br>by just giving them a beautiful new place to live, unconditionally.</p>
  <p>But also with the promise,<br>that we will all learn and work together to find a way to reverse climate change, so that those who wish, can go back, when ready.</p>
  <p>These people are not Climate Refugees, they are our family,<br>Become A Great Being.</p>

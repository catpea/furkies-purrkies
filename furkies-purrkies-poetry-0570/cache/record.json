even though many are somewhat aware they've never read a book for real.\nAnd very few will be awaken to how indoctrination warped their minds before they go too far[3],\nwe are all very beautiful, but we can be warped by culture and indoctrination into acting against our family, and then snatched by a infantile criminal justice system incapable of helping.\nThe law is incapable of processing lack of education, group-think, clouded minds,\nand the law should be applied to politicians more than to those who are uneducated due to political failings, but that is not the case.\nBefore we rebuild criminal justice, and comprehend the simple primitive notion that we must replace prisons with real schools, something these kids didn't have,\nand get to the more complicated stuff, where we actually begin seeing criminals as people in urgent need of real help, not in need of sick punishment that will unravel their minds further.\nWe need real schools,\nin 30 years time, humanity must see it self as one family, because half of us will need help.\nChildren are not born hating each other because of color, or the place they were born to,\nit is the uneducated that spread the divisions.\nTo fix the hate that currently makes it impossible to help billions of people out of the upcoming climate crisis,\nwe need real schools, and real education.\nIt is the same thing that inmates need,\nit is the same thing that people of hate need.\nIt is the same thing that normal people need,\nit is the same thing that children need.\nIt is the same thing we need,\nreal schools and real education is what the world really needs.\n\nYou are right to sense that there are very few stable answers here,\nthat is because we didn't get the education that is worthy of us.\nLet me show you, you are now in a nation somewhere, one that is encircled by a political border,\nand you see absolutely nothing wrong with that - even though I just told you three billion people will need help in 30 years.\n\nIt is not just knowledge that we need,\nand it is not just knowledge that we get when we learn.\nOur mind accumulates the structures of the things we learn about,\nand is able to dynamically apply the structures to new problems, by a subtle analogy.\nThat is wisdom,\nbeautifully thinking by subtle analogy.\nAnd then what follows wisdom is Greatness\ngreatness is something else.\nGreatness is never what you expect,\nit will always make you feel small.\nIt is hearing the words \"But I want you all to know that this is not me\"[4],\nand actually understanding that as our failure, to help the children grow into Great Human Beings - which is the real and only solution to the upcoming global crisis.\nIn order to help all those in need in 30 years,\nwe must look past our hate or fear of those fractured by lack of education[5], and understand what \"But I want you all to know that this is not me\" really means.\nIt means real school, real education, meaningful and real books,\nlife changing lectures that transform the students from whatever they were born into, into lovers of wisdom, and great beings that change the world for better.\nPlease, find a way to understand that even though the climate crisis will begin in 30 years,\nthe time to fix it, is right now.\nWe must build real schools,\nand ensure real education.\nWe must become great beings, and erase all divisions, and all borders,\nwe must understand that this one world is for us all.\nWe must prevent the suffering of billions,\nby just giving them a beautiful new place to live, unconditionally.\nBut also with the promise,\nthat we will all learn and work together to find a way to reverse climate change, so that those who wish, can go back, when ready.\nThese people are not Climate Refugees, they are our family,\nBecome A Great Being.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl4Uv9_7KJE\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m8as2cM_4Y\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ4GjzuM72s\n[4]: https://youtu.be/WJ4GjzuM72s?t=97\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw",

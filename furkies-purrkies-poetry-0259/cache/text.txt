Even if you set off at noon,
you will discover, the new moon.

While the day is full of light,
it is not over, till midnight.

Because, once your eyes get used to the night,
the moon and the stars, become almost as bright.

Though many, may count their sheep,
an adventurer need not yet go, to sleep.

Please, believe me, there are sights to see!
there is a second world out here, and night is key.

Aside from the occasional streak of silent owl,
you may catch a pack of coyotes, look up, and howl.

Some grasses by the beach glow blue,
static electricity can create a breathtaking view.

Over in the ocean all the glowing fish come out,
they look like stars, when scattered about.

And the moon does not glow, it carries a reflection of the sun,
the photons touched it, and now touch us, in their cosmic fun.

The trees take on a whole new life in the moonlight,
rich green fragrant watchers of your campsite.

The night in many ways is just as bright as the day,
if you have never been on an adventure... please don't delay.

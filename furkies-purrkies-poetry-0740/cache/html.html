  <p>The world needs a platform,<br>where people can request portraits.</p>
  <p>To get things moving a user uploads an image and sets a budget,<br>then artists compete to win.</p>
  <p>And of course each artist has a store,<br>where users can request paintings.</p>

  <p>The competition,<br>is a way to get people interested, curious, and moving, and maybe stressing a bit.</p>
  <p>And store pages,<br>is where artists quietly make money.</p>

  <p>I think it is fair to say,<br>that this is a small visual website where we can allow images speak for them selves.</p>
  <p>This could also mean that informative icons would dominate text,<br>and make the UI less cluttered for international users.</p>
  <p>The UI should be simple,<br>and text comments should rule over complex user interfaces.</p>

  <p>To make things look good,<br>let us encourage square artworks.</p>
  <p>Everything will always align,<br>and we can use square tiles everywhere.</p>

  <p>Artists and Users each have a homepage,<br>almost like a dashboard.</p>
  <p>When user logs in, they will see a list of the photos they uploaded,<br>along with progress images when the artworks are being worked on.</p>
  <p>Once a user pays, an artist will upload the big version of the file,<br>and then a download button will show up on the user's dashboard.</p>

  <p>When the artist logs in,<br>they will see art requests, which consist of two things, a neatly cropped square photo request, and a budget.</p>
  <p>Here the artist can request a better photo,<br>or say the budget is too small and decline the request.</p>
  <p>Mostly they will upload progress images,<br>this will show the customers they are loved and appreciated.</p>

  <p>There are some bonus features that can be explored,<br>including a monthly subscription to a gold plan.</p>
  <p>But it is better to wait,<br>and see what features users a willing to pay for.</p>

  <p>Finally, there is an area here for investors,<br>and business owners.</p>
  <p>These are the folks,<br>who are interested in building artist communities.</p>
  <p>They bring a .com domain name to this system,<br>and build out the home page.</p>
  <p>So this system can have multiple home pages,<br>though it starts with one and grows slowly.</p>
  <p>The key feature of the investor or partner back-end,<br>is tools for on-boarding artists and customers, along with some useful statistics.</p>
  <p>Here the artist community owner can install a private business tool,<br>that will help with efficiently contacting artists to mutual benefit.</p>
  <p>Depending on the business configuration,<br>this can be for the purpose of asking for permission to post their art, or offering a sign-up bonuses.</p>
  <p>We can all agree that this is a very nice website for artists,<br>And artists seeking work would benefit from at least knowing about it.</p>
  <p>Businesses like this grow,<br>by reaching out to artists and getting them to sign up.</p>
  <p>If it is done honestly,<br>respectfully and without annoying them.</p>
  <p>It is called good business,<br>that benefits both the investors and the artists - and even the entire art community as a whole.</p>

  <p>Don't just settle on a good idea,<br>look up and ask about store owners, and do it again and ask about community builders, ask about investors, always keep thinking up.</p>

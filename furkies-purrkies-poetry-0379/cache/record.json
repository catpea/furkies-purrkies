<p>And this is not a secret,</p>\n  <p>especially when it comes to real jobs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not jobs that will train you,</p>\n  <p>but ones that expect you to lead as an innovator.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So the interview process, is not about how many solutions to entrance exam puzzles you memorized,</p>\n  <p>but about the puzzles that do not come with solutions, at all.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I know what you are thinking,</p>\n  <p>you are not smart enough to lead, and try

 <p>This isn&apos;t about the school at all,</p>\n  <p>the school is a theater that puts on a play.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The play sustains it self,</p>\n  <p>it propagates it self, it is self referential, it exist for its own sake.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The twice as hard is there for everyone,</p>\n  <p>it is there to convince you that it is worth

school,</p>\n  <p>it is just a few more tests, AND THEN A DECADE OF PRACTICE.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This right here should tell you,</p>\n  <p>how useful you school is.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Hence questions without answers,</p>\n  <p>questions that test your ability to think outside of the

before.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In deed that you paid for an education,</p>\n  <p>that you would have gained on your own had you been more responsible is a huge red

mind.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The interview will be testing the greatness of your being,</p>\n  <p>all the fields outside of the position you seek.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They will expect to see a demonstration of the breadth of your knowledge,</p>\n  <p>by watching you apply solutions from other fields by a simple and subtle analogy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Mind you,</p>\n  <p>schools only taught you a single path.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Only one question out of the multiple was correct.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And here it is even more complex,</p>\n  <p>because there is no answer.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is a question of scanning for a solution,</p>\n  <p>that does not exist.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The reason why you are being

class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is the quality intricacy and complexity of the search for the solution,</p>\n  <p>that is being evaluated.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But there is friction here,</p>\n  <p>because a real interview that does not actually insult you, approaches your soul all too close.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All your genius, even if schools tricked you into believing you don&apos;t have it,</p>\n  <p>and all the while asking you to trust them they will be there for you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That they will be there when you are thirty and build not just a house but a home,</p>\n  <p>they will be there when you are forty and try to live a healthier and more balanced life,</p>\n  <p>they will be there when you are fifty, and sixty, and maybe seventy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In their inexperience they are challenging your soul, and your greatness,</p>\n  <p>and asking you to give it to them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The best interview tip I have for you,</p>\n  <p>is to go there to question them instead.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Ask them how much of you do they expect you to give,</p>\n  <p>and how much is your pay in proportion to the CEO.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And how long do they expect yo to work there,</p>\n  <p>and how much do they think years of your life are really worth.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I recommend you ask that same question,</p>\n  <p>at every interview...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>and learn to no end,</p>\n  <p>how your job is not that different from the minimal almost fake education that took your savings.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The answer to the original question that brought you here,</p>\n  <p>was not College and Career.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It was Self Education,</p>\n  <p>and Entrepreneurship.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You took the road more traveled,</p>\n  <p>the first stretch took your money, and the second will take your decades so you can pay off the debt.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And you better have huge debt,</p>\n  <p>because if you don&apos;t, then you don&apos;t even have a reason to go in to the interview.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Either way,</p>\n  <p>this is not the way.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Every year of your life,</p>\n  <p>is infinitely more valuable, than anything you will find, working for somebody else.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So stop it,</p>\n  <p>stop now before it is too late.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are meant to learn for real,</p>\n  <p>you are mean to be truly knowledgeable, far beyond anything that can be asked at an interview.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No matter their zest for genius,</p>\n  <p>they wouldn&apos;t come up with a question to capture one, their very position and approach is proof they wouldn&apos;t know what one looks like.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As you can no doubt tell,</p>\n  <p>a lot behind those questions is there so that they can impress themselves.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But enough about that stupid interview,</p>\n  <p>that is not the way, that is not your way.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have been misled by education and the promise of a safe job,</p>\n  <p>today all of this still just about moneymaking.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have been spread thin,</p>\n  <p>you must pull yourself back together.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have to go back and restore the predispositions that schools stripped yo off,</p>\n  <p>in their haste to sell your mind for a paycheck, and later for your tuition.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your unique predispositions are the only key to your future,</p>\n  <p>you may think to yourself that you only had one, and it was ridiculously child like.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Yes, that is what a predisposition for greatness emerges as initially,</p>\n  <p>a childhood curiosity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And then as you tend to it it will fork and grow like a large corona,</p>\n  <p>you will enter stages of Art and Music, Uniqueness and Creativity, you will zoom right past being a Genius and a Polymath, and learn things worth a thousand times more.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So many things, that those asking those interview questions will look infantile,</p>\n  <p>it will feel like a bunch of actors trying to make themselves look bigger either by caring to much r pretending to care too little.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Enough is enough,</p>\n  <p>and no, it won&apos;t work temporary.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You need those years to grow,</p>\n  <p>not to rent them out to bigger than thou ding-dongs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Finally, I am canceling your interview tomorrow,</p>\n  <p>because it is a waste of your time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Instead you are going shopping to prepare for an expedition,</p>\n  <p>find the longest Adventure Trail wherever you live, Appalachian, Pacific Crest, whatever, and pack.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Get a Journal and a waterproof marker,</p>\n  <p>and discover the polymath in you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you return,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM\">build a series of small companies until you learn how to do it right</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And never again follow,</p>\n  <p>and never again let someone tell you who you are, or smart you are, or where you need to be, or how much you are worth to them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Be mindful of your legacy,</p>\n  <p>and of those who are being misguided right now, help them learn, prevent them from making the same mistakes you did.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The world stands still, today, the politics are frozen, even the police kills those who they are sworn to protect,</p>\n  <p>the World can only grow when you and countless others unleash the Genius, the Polymath, and the Greatness, within.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No interview,</p>\n  <p>you are meant to become a great being.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The World needs you to lead,</p>\n  <p>no more dumb interviews there isn&apos;t a company noble enough, there isn&apos;t a company worthy of your time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is not the kind of a world,</p>\n  <p>each generation must progress forward, what you see before you is not fixed, it is just an imperfect stepping stone froward.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Stop letting others search for you,</p>\n  <p>and set of on an endless adventure to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug\">discover the great being within</a>.</p>\n</div>",

is even more complex,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because there is no answer.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The reason why you are being asked questions

  "text": "So everything you memorized,\ngoes straight out the window.\nYou will be thrown against questions without answers,\nand judged based on the methods you use to eventually fail.\nIt is the quality of your thinking,\nnot the solution of the problem that gets you the position.\n\nSupply and demand, money...\nyou've been made to memorize answers to trick puzzles since high school.\nThe entrance exams,\nare little more than crossword puzzles.\nAnd the whole educational experience between middle school and university, inclusive,\nis about people making money off of you.\nFor the same reason why military does not recruit middle aged men,\nwhy the only go after the ones that didn't have a chance to become wise yet.\nBusinesses grow in places where there is money,\nand there is money in selling promises of futures.\n\nAnd this is not a secret,\nespecially when it comes to real jobs.\nNot jobs that will train you,\nbut ones that expect you to lead as an innovator.\nSo the interview process, is not about how many solutions to entrance exam puzzles you memorized,\nbut about the puzzles that do not come with solutions, at all.\n\nI know what you are thinking,\nyou are not smart enough to lead, and try to solve those problems.\nYou had a tough time inn school,\nand nobody knows the you worked twice as hard.\nThis isn't about the school at all,\nthe school is a theater that puts on a play.\nThe play sustains it self,\nit propagates it self, it is self referential, it exist for its own sake.\nThe twice as hard is there for everyone,\nit is there to convince you that it is worth the while.\nBut, it is not, worth the while,\nit is not worth the diploma anymore.\nLook at med school,\nit is just a few more tests, AND THEN A DECADE OF PRACTICE.\nThis right here should tell you,\nhow useful you school is.\n\nHence questions without answers,\nquestions that test your ability to think outside of the box.\nQuestions that have nothing to do with formulas or facts you memorized,\nand have everything to do with things you have never encountered before.\nIn deed that you paid for an education,\nthat you would have gained on your own had you been more responsible is a huge red minus.\nYou got yourself tricked,\nand now you don't even know the job is after the best decades of your life, and whatever is best in your mind.\nThe interview will be testing the greatness of your being,\nall the fields outside of the position you seek.\n\nThey will expect to see a demonstration of the breadth of your knowledge,\nby watching you apply solutions from other fields by a simple and subtle analogy.\nMind you,\nschools only taught you a single path.\nOnly one question out of the multiple was correct.\nAnd here it is even more complex,\nbecause there is no answer.\nThis is a question of scanning for a solution,\nthat does not exist.\n\nThe reason why you are being asked questions without answers,\nis to reveal the number and quality of attempts at the solution before you realize or are told that there is no answer.\nIt is the quality intricacy and complexity of the search for the solution,\nthat is being evaluated.\n\nBut there is friction here,\nbecause a real interview that does not actually insult you, approaches your soul all too close.\nAll your genius, even if schools tricked you into believing you don't have it,\nand all the while asking you to trust them they will be there for you.\nThat they will be there when you are thirty and build not just a house but a home,\nthey will be there when you are forty and try to live a healthier and more balanced life,\nthey will be there when you are fifty, and sixty, and maybe seventy.\nIn their inexperience they are challenging your soul, and your greatness,\nand asking you to give it to them.\n\nThe best interview tip I have for you,\nis to go there to question them instead.\nAsk them how much of you do they expect you to give,\nand how much is your pay in proportion to the CEO.\nAnd how long do they expect yo to work there,\nand how much do they think years of your life are really worth.\n\nI recommend you ask that same question,\nat every interview...\nand learn to no end,\nhow your job is not that different from the minimal almost fake education that took your savings.\n\nThe answer to the original question that brought you here,\nwas not College and Career.\nIt was Self Education,\nand Entrepreneurship.\nYou took the road more traveled,\nthe first stretch took your money, and the second will take your decades so you can pay off the debt.\nAnd you better have huge debt,\nbecause if you don't, then you don't even have a reason to go in to the interview.\nEither way,\nthis is not the way.\nEvery year of your life,\nis infinitely more valuable, than anything you will find, working for somebody else.\nSo stop it,\nstop now before it is too late.\nYou are meant to learn for real,\nyou are mean to be truly knowledgeable, far beyond anything that can be asked at an interview.\nNo matter their zest for genius,\nthey wouldn't come up with a question to capture one, their very position and approach is proof they wouldn't know what one looks like.\nAs you can no

Don't let them put you on a school bus.
Tell you parents, school is crazy!

And anyway,
they shouldn't be so lazy.

You will need all the games,
and you memorize no presidential names.

You demand a trip to every national park.
because you will not spend you life in the dark.

You will need every audio-book ever made,
and only then will you go through life unafraid.

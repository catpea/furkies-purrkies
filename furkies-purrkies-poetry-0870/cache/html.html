  <p>In 1804 Earth had 1 billion people,<br>in 25 years it will have 10 billion.</p>
  <p>The only thing we can do is build real schools,<br>that bring real education, real wisdom, and real greatness into peoples hands.</p>
  <p>These schools need to be powerful and beautiful,<br>no punishment, no grades, no assholes, just pure love for wisdom.</p>

  <p>All these other things that good and secretly bad people talk about,<br>are non-sense, shortsighted, infantile nonsense.</p>
  <p>Every human being is capable of Beautiful Genius,<br>but we are all too easily mislead.</p>
  <p>Right now,<br>poverty is the biggest negative force.</p>
  <p>Poverty,<br>is preventing people from learning.</p>
  <p>We need universal income,<br>because the world is too big to keep it in poverty.</p>

  <p>It is a gift for the future generations,<br>so that young people from all around the word...</p>
  <p>Can cheerfully wake up in the morning,<br>take a cab to the airport.</p>
  <p>Rent an apartment in their favorite city,<br>have lunch each morning at a museum.</p>
  <p>And spend most of their days,<br>listening to audio books.</p>
  <p>While browsing libraries, record stores,<br>art shops and stores, and Sushi restaurants.</p>

  <p>Unless they can grow,<br>by exploring the safe parts of the world.</p>
  <p>The neighborhoods where they are from,<br>will never know modern culture.</p>
  <p>When a generation is denied access to modern culture,<br>there is always an evil and deliberate reason.</p>
  <p>Those time and cultural gaps<br>will be used for slavery and war.</p>
  <p>The politicians will not fix this,<br>in 35 years they will have long retired.</p>

  <p>You donâ€™t need to start with universal income,<br>just the school that will help people see how important it is.</p>
  <p>It is all really up to you,<br>and your generation.</p>

  <p>January 1st 2057 can become the year,<br>when the world celebrates World Peace and Wisdom.</p>
  <p>Stop pretending to learn by memorizing for grades and a promise of some imaginary future,<br>and accept the responsibility for real and profound self education.</p>
  <p>Take to authentic knowledge,<br>and it in turn will take you to authentic wisdom.</p>
  <p>And wisdom, is the enlightenment you need,<br>to light your way to greatness...</p>
  <p>And the beautiful and peaceful future,<br>that truly, is worthy of you.</p>

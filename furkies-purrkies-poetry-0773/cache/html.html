  <p>There are low level languages,<br>and high level languages.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>In a low level language,<br>you talk to a hard drive in a way that hard drives like to be talked to.</p>
  <p>In a high level language,<br>you open a Desktop Window with a simple bit of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>High level languages have a concept of objects,<br>that is really fun to write out and play with.</p>
  <p>People create window objects with actions like,<br>open or close.</p>
  <p>When you tell a window to open, with title more than two words,<br>it pops up.</p>
  <p>You can point it at a web page,<br>or put some input boxes and a button in there, to have the user say something.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Sometimes objects are used to create,<br>more powerful objects.</p>
  <p>Orbs connected by wires,<br>or actions that have a concept of before and after where you can add more actions.</p>

  <p>And this is where the party flops,<br>any programmers that venture beyond this point unravel.</p>
  <p>They may make some games,<br>maybe card decks with user interfaces, maybe virtual worlds.</p>
  <p>But it all falls apart here,<br>people don't do anything beyond this point.</p>
  <p>And if they try they end up with what has been refereed to as,<br>leaky abstractions.</p>
  <p>Where you use windows,<br>but they can't be opened, or something equally mangled.</p>
  <p>There are also folks here,<br>who have been taught to map out low level stuff with objects.</p>
  <p>They create objects like Hard drive,<br>or file, or file with a documents property that explains where the documents folder is.</p>
  <p>They just code themselves in a circle,<br>they use high level tools for creating concepts of low level things.</p>
  <p>Things that are already done,<br>and they create an unreadable mess of non-sense.</p>
  <p>Programming,<br>for programming's sake.</p>

  <p>Practical Applications of Object Oriented Programming,<br>are discovered by Poets and Artist, not Engineers.</p>
  <p>And there is a point there,<br>where you call the program done.</p>
  <p>And let the users do all the programming,<br>because there is only a few engineers and a million users.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So this is a Higher Level Programming Language,<br>where you don't have to worry about low level stuff.</p>
  <p>In fact if you need a special bit of functionality,<br>that needs to be filled with standard programming.</p>
  <p>You describe what you need,<br>with Behavior Driven Development language, which is pretty English.</p>
  <p>And wait until that functionality,<br>becomes a puzzle or more precisely a robot, that you and other users can use in the programs.</p>

  <p>The programs that you may wish to build,<br>are the same or similar to what leading internet companies are doing.</p>
  <p>Except you are making them with a high level language,<br>where it is trivial, and clear.</p>

  <p>The first problem you have to tackle,<br>is your monthly server bills, and this is cheap and easy.</p>
  <p>When a user signs up for a developer account with your company,<br>they have to bring in their own server.</p>
  <p>The server will have a standard spreadsheet like database,<br>and whatever pieces of the puzzle they use.</p>
  <p>If the server is cheap,<br>and they have a sudden spike in traffic.</p>
  <p>Then it is their responsibility,<br>to turn on a second one.</p>
  <p>Which will jump into processing the queue of actions,<br>that are taking to long to be solved by one server.</p>
  <p>It is better to launch a couple just in case,<br>and as the traffic dies down, they will shut down, having been up for hours it is not expensive.</p>
  <p>You are welcome to offer a premium service,<br>but I like application creators to accept responsibilities.</p>

  <p>With your network being ever expanded by users,<br>lets talk about the Higher Level Language.</p>

  <p>We have to start with Beauty, Class, and Tradition,<br>so the user interface is a work of art like no other.</p>
  <p>It is beautified by users, and your first user interface theme,<br>is nothing less fascinating Pixel Art, with a heavy undertone of Retro Futurism.</p>
  <p>It will look like a computer game,<br>or more precisely, like a utility program from the old days of Commodore and Amiga.</p>
  <p>Investing into Beauty and Art, is important,<br>your users will actually understand everything you are doping....</p>
  <p>By just looking at the screenshot,<br>in fact, the screenshot will not only haunt them....</p>
  <p>But they will return to your system,<br>with a back of the envelope sketch of a custom program they always wanted to use.</p>

  <p>Now that we have the servers. or more precisely,<br>distributed self provisioning server architecture taken care of.</p>
  <p>Now, that we have the beautiful user interface,<br>that users are always welcome to improve with more breathtaking pixel art.</p>
  <p>Let us look at the language it self,<br>it is of course very simple, friendly, and requires no learning.</p>
  <p>That is the true definition,<br>of a higher level programming language.</p>

  <p>It is a world of rooms that have doors to other rooms,<br>this not only allows to categorize things in a user friendly way, similar to files, folders, windows and desktops.</p>
  <p>But also allows for creation of simple to reason about,<br>processes or, state machines.</p>
  <p>And that is accomplished with the concept of a package,<br>or a box that contains things in it.</p>
  <p>It can for example contain a picture,<br>that a user may want to convert into a painting.</p>
  <p>This package is addressed to an artist,<br>then you will be notified when it is looked at, approved, queued, and when the progress of the task changes.</p>

  <p>The most important object is the user,<br>and here the users can move around the system, interact, create forums - or write on the wall if you like.</p>
  <p>And users have inventories,<br>they have a key to their own private areas, and whatever administrative rooms they built up as part of creating their inventions.</p>
  <p>They have a passport with memberships to private communities,<br>and coins, that can be spent on purchases, and purchased, of course.</p>

  <p>Similar to a user,<br>is the bot.</p>
  <p>Bots help with tasks such as creation of a specific package,<br>or designing a new package from scratch for some new purpose.</p>
  <p>But these bots, are extremely powerful,<br>they can write poetry, create computer programs, and even analyze x-rays.</p>
  <p>Because a bot can be powered by a group of users,<br>in the case of x-rays, a group of doctors from around the world.</p>
  <p>And it should be customary,<br>that before a human based action taken a consensus must be reached, and then further verified by more human participants.</p>
  <p>This is very similar to a Jury Room,<br>or how self checkout registers (which are robots) use humans to solve problems that they can't deal with.</p>

  <p>Finally, you need a way to automate things,<br>and you should start simple and easy at first.</p>
  <p>You create a factory out of rooms,<br>that accepts certain kinds of packages.</p>
  <p>That are then processed by bots,<br>sent to another room, and processed by more bots.</p>
  <p>Your factory does not need to be liner,<br>it can be a tree, based on some condition in the package, it can be sent to a different room, to a different group of bots.</p>
  <p>The packages that enter a room are put in a queue,<br>and I recommend you use the concept of an assembly line.</p>
  <p>The bots are attached to it in a sequence,<br>this will help you group small tasks without the need for networks of rooms.</p>

  <p>There are no leaky abstractions here,<br>just a handful of easy to grasp things.</p>
  <p>To start, put a bounty out,<br>for the most delightful implementation of this system.</p>
  <p>Emphasize small but clear to read code base,<br>source lines of code wise, this is not a large program.</p>

Face recognition,
sometimes photos don't capture the right angle.

When we know someone personally,
we recognize them based on a series of angles.

In a photo,
we only get one angle.

And what is worse,
lenses can distort the face even more.

As well as software trying to be helpful,
and even the scene, the focus, the colors.

Sometimes, a person's expression,
can alter their appearance.

And the last thing you need,
is your art creating a sense of distance.

And not closeness,
as it is intended.

---

Photogrammetry with neutral lighting,
that allows for customizing the angle and light source later, mayyybe, is one way to do it.

[This also means that a scanned portrait can be printed in 3D][0],
the software [Meshroom][1], [Blender][2] and [Prusa Slicer][3] is all free.

But the oldest solution,
is best.

That means you have to see the person you are going to paint, in 3D,
it won't take you very long to understand their main angle.

This means that although your painting will be based on a single photo,
you will need several minutes of video.

And few dozen photos at slightly different angles,
and in different lighting conditions.

---

It can be quite an experience to go from having seen one,
to multiple photos.

Sometimes, it may seem,
that the first couple of photos show two different people.

Sisters, lookalikes,
and definitely not the same person.

---

I call this,
the biggest problem in art.

Painting,
the wrong, "twin".

---

In closing I would like to underline that stylized paintings,
are just as precious as hyperrealistic ones.

But, reducing an eye down to a stylized version,
while retaining the correct appearance of a person, will take a while.

Especially when taking your first steps away from Hyperrealism,
you will get stuck here - but this - is not a problem.

This is your education,
the point where you are getting stuck is your next milestone.

And the reason why you are getting stuck,
is because even a realistic stylized appearance, is an illustration.

It is no longer a photo, where you are conquering light,
now, you are assembling a perfected eye, component by component.

This is not meant to be,
a source of frustration.

Building your first bridge of knowledge,
between Breathtaking Hyperrealism, and Enchanting Beautiful Stylization...

Will surely become,
one of your most memorable journeys.

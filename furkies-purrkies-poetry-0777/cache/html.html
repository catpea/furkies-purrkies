  <p>Face recognition,<br>sometimes photos don't capture the right angle.</p>
  <p>When we know someone personally,<br>we recognize them based on a series of angles.</p>
  <p>In a photo,<br>we only get one angle.</p>
  <p>And what is worse,<br>lenses can distort the face even more.</p>
  <p>As well as software trying to be helpful,<br>and even the scene, the focus, the colors.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, a person's expression,<br>can alter their appearance.</p>
  <p>And the last thing you need,<br>is your art creating a sense of distance.</p>
  <p>And not closeness,<br>as it is intended.</p>

  <p>Photogrammetry with neutral lighting,<br>that allows for customizing the angle and light source later, mayyybe, is one way to do it.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiLAOtjHNo">This also means that a scanned portrait can be printed in 3D</a>,<br>the software <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=meshroom+tutorial">Meshroom</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+tutorial+for+beginners">Blender</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=prusaslicer+for+ender+3+v2+">Prusa Slicer</a> is all free.</p>
  <p>But the oldest solution,<br>is best.</p>
  <p>That means you have to see the person you are going to paint, in 3D,<br>it won't take you very long to understand their main angle.</p>
  <p>This means that although your painting will be based on a single photo,<br>you will need several minutes of video.</p>
  <p>And few dozen photos at slightly different angles,<br>and in different lighting conditions.</p>

  <p>It can be quite an experience to go from having seen one,<br>to multiple photos.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, it may seem,<br>that the first couple of photos show two different people.</p>
  <p>Sisters, lookalikes,<br>and definitely not the same person.</p>

  <p>I call this,<br>the biggest problem in art.</p>
  <p>Painting,<br>the wrong, "twin".</p>

  <p>In closing I would like to underline that stylized paintings,<br>are just as precious as hyperrealistic ones.</p>
  <p>But, reducing an eye down to a stylized version,<br>while retaining the correct appearance of a person, will take a while.</p>
  <p>Especially when taking your first steps away from Hyperrealism,<br>you will get stuck here - but this - is not a problem.</p>
  <p>This is your education,<br>the point where you are getting stuck is your next milestone.</p>
  <p>And the reason why you are getting stuck,<br>is because even a realistic stylized appearance, is an illustration.</p>
  <p>It is no longer a photo, where you are conquering light,<br>now, you are assembling a perfected eye, component by component.</p>
  <p>This is not meant to be,<br>a source of frustration.</p>
  <p>Building your first bridge of knowledge,<br>between Breathtaking Hyperrealism, and Enchanting Beautiful Stylization...</p>
  <p>Will surely become,<br>one of your most memorable journeys.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When we know someone personally,<br>we recognize them based on a series of angles.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In a photo,<br>we only get one angle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And what is worse,<br>lenses can distort the face even more.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As well as software trying to be helpful,<br>and even the scene, the focus, the colors.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Sometimes, a person's expression,<br>can alter their appearance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the last thing you need,<br>is your art creating a sense of distance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And not closeness,<br>as it is intended.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Photogrammetry with neutral lighting,<br>that allows for customizing the angle and light source later, mayyybe, is one way to do it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiLAOtjHNo">This also means that a scanned portrait can be printed in 3D</a>,<br>the software <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=meshroom+tutorial">Meshroom</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+tutorial+for+beginners">Blender</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=prusaslicer+for+ender+3+v2+">Prusa Slicer</a> is all free.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But the oldest solution,<br>is best.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That means you have to see the person you are going to paint, in 3D,<br>it won't take you very long to understand their main angle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This means that although your painting will be based on a single photo,<br>you will need several minutes of video.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And few dozen photos at slightly different angles,<br>and in different lighting conditions.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In closing I would like to underline that stylized paintings,<br>are just as precious as hyperrealistic ones.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But, reducing an eye down to a stylized version,<br>while retaining the correct appearance of a person, will take a while.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Especially when taking your first steps away from Hyperrealism,<br>you will get stuck here - but this - is not a problem.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is your education,<br>the point where you are getting stuck is your next milestone.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the reason why you are getting stuck,<br>is because even a realistic stylized appearance, is an illustration.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is no longer a photo, where you are conquering light,<br>now, you are assembling a perfected eye, component by component.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is not meant to be,<br>a source of frustration.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Building your first bridge of knowledge,<br>between Breathtaking Hyperrealism, and Enchanting Beautiful Stylization...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Will surely become,<br>one of your most memorable journeys.</div>

  <p>You know that scary horror movie you saw as a child?<br>it is coming back the moment you set your foot in the wild.</p>
  <p>I know "Ha ha" you say,<br>but just wait until the end of day.</p>
  <p>Alf, Oompa-Loompas, Aliens, Gremlins, The Freaking Omen,<br>that giant from the Goonies, along with the gigantic woman...</p>
  <p>...even the Jaws' shark,<br>will show up the moment it gets dark.</p>
  <p>If it is quiet,<br>it will sound like a riot.</p>
  <p>As you can hear them tip toeing your way,<br>and there is nothing you can do or say.</p>

  <p>The only way to get through the first night,<br>is just go to sleep clutching your flashlight.</p>

  <p>Just the moment you calm you heart beat,<br>you remember snakes are drawn to heat.</p>
  <p>Let me tell you if you see a puff adder in Michigan,<br>you will mutter "I am never going to go camping again".</p>
  <p>But don't worry they are only mildly toxic when they bite,<br>that's assuming that Wikipedia is right.</p>

  <p>And if not the snakes then the spider come out at night,<br>because they are attracted to your light.</p>
  <p>They are the color of sand,<br>so you won't see them on land.</p>
  <p>Unless you have a good flashlight and shine on their shiny butts,<br>sometimes you find so many, it's nuts.</p>

  <p>But the most frightening thing are the woodland creatures,<br>as each has very deadly features.</p>
  <p>The bald eagle has very sharp claws,<br>and will try to gently touch your head, just because.</p>
  <p>Bats don't actually get stuck in you hear,<br>they just land there to lick them like crazy - I swear.</p>
  <p>Deer have antlers that are actually super sticky,<br>if you stick to one things get tricky.</p>

  <p>I once heard a story about a hawk,<br>that crashed into a car like a rock.</p>

  <p>By far the worst animals are the Bobcat and <a href="https://catpea.com/read/furkies-purrkies/220/">The Owl</a>,<br>one will Hoot Hoot and the other Growl EEEEEEEEEEeE</p>
  <p>The Bobcat,<br>will try to bite you in the butt.</p>

  <p>The owl, looking down from up in the air,<br>gets seriously confused about balding mens hair.</p>
  <p>Unless the man has a hat,<br>the owls will think that it is a plump rat.</p>
  <p>And with great fanfare,<br>they will swoop down and rip and tear.</p>

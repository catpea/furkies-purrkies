  <p>Be careful when listening to advice,<br>as every Human Being has their own path of curiosities.</p>
  <p>And you should be just as careful when it comes to culture,<br>as the parts of you that change depending on what culture you are born to, are probably temporary.</p>

  <p>If you get pushed off your own path,<br>you will enter a lifeline that will be alien to you.</p>
  <p>Complexity of life arranges for emergence of inspirational lessons, powerful observations, and helpful signals,<br>but we have to walk the paths that we feel strongly and passionately about, to learn the most.</p>

  <p>I don't remember where or even if I heard it somewhere (though probably did),<br>but from time to time when questions of advice come up...</p>
  <p>I encourage people to ask <em>their elder selves</em> what their regrets maybe,<br>picturing our elder selves can gently guide us onto the correct paths, somehow.</p>
  <p>And just in case you are still young, Dear Reader,<br>you should know, that even back when we are young, we already have a <em>mighty grasp</em> on powerful wisdom.</p>

  <p>I just followed my own little road,<br>road of adventure, archaeology, programming, and freedom from any and all bullies and bull$hit.</p>

  <p>I don't know how I did it,<br>but now, that I have slowed down to write.</p>
  <p>I see my adventures as being on par with anything that Indiana Jones could live through,<br>I had so many hot flashes from near wild animal attacks, that they just became another way of measuring my adventures.</p>
  <p>And short of <a href="https://catpea.com/read/furkies-purrkies/395/">losing my most precious artifact</a>,<br>my archaeology was always on point, to this day I keep an eye on museums.</p>
  <p>And my computer programming has been steadily advancing since I was ten or so,<br>I learn about all the things that fit me, at the pace that suits me best, and in the perfect sequence.</p>

  <p>I totally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Bret+Victor+Programming">understand what computer inventors are talking about</a>, but like the critics I have also noticed,<br>that <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/everythings-broken-and-nobodys-upset">there are a lot of broken things in the computer world</a> that almost everybody is ignoring.</p>
  <p>In terms of software, I like to ask myself what is the minimum useful implementation of all the programs that we use,<br>and it is often very sad and shocking how over-engineered, and bloated, and slow, and heavy all the software it.</p>
  <p>When I look at simple command line menus on my computer, I see the stark difference,<br>the first person to minify all the programs to a useful minimum will surely become internet famous.</p>

  <p>See, I just walked my own road, making my own observations, and learning my own lessons,<br>I didn't allow anybody to push me away from all my tiny and delicate curiosities.</p>
  <p>When we like something, and follow it,<br>somehow it always becomes far greater than what initially called to us.</p>
  <p>It is never just art, or museum, or nature,<br>it is more like a pyramid, and you just keep going and going and going.</p>
  <p>And before you know it,<br>it turns out, that you know a whole million, of somewhat-interesting stories.</p>

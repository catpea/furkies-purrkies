problem.\n\nAlso consider the alternative, a combination of the Appalachian[13] and Pacific Crest[14] Trails,\ncombined with a countless number of small companies that one by one, will teach you how to succeed[15], and perhaps give employment to your family as well.\nToday, Humanity still lacks the Intelligence and Will to repair the money problem[16],\nthat is part of the reason why you just can't get a job to make your parents happy.\nMoney is not meant to hold Humanity Back,\nit is supposed to help us grow.\nThe longer we wait to repair this invisible problem,\nthe more needless suffering our Noble and Brilliant Sisters and Brothers will undergo.\n\nThe Universe bows to you,\nall the future generations bow to you, and with love and understanding, and in, gratitude.\nEven if all you do, is think about it,\nand notice it, perhaps hope to fix it.\nThe moment you do something that will touch and help the Humanity of the Future,\nthey will all come to visit you, in their thoughts, and appreciation.\n\nThe changes that are needed,\nrequire billions of Great Minds working together across multiple generations.\nI believe,\nYou are one of those Great Minds.\nBecome,\na

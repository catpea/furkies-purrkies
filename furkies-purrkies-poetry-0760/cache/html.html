  <p>Humanity,<br>is a baby.</p>
  <p>Humanity can only grow,<br>when people grow.</p>
  <p>And to grow,<br>does not mean a little bit.</p>

  <p>You will need powerful books,<br>written (and preferably read) by fine storytellers.</p>
  <p>Normally, children start where parents retire,<br>but in a world corroded by poverty, this is rare.</p>
  <p>With the power of books,<br>not only do you inherit multiple lifetimes of wisdom.</p>
  <p>But get to stand,<br>on the shoulders of their authors.</p>

  <p>If you want to know,<br>if there is an alternative to books.</p>
  <p>There is only the curse from which they emerge,<br>the alternative to books, can only be tragedy.</p>
  <p>In Friedrich's words,<br>"Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich st√§rker"</p>
  <p>Dr. Frankl describes it with more light,<br>"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."</p>

  <p>These are the men,<br>who begun at zero.</p>
  <p>The men upon whose shoulders,<br>you should stand.</p>

  <p>Do not search for an alternative to books,<br>your life is meant to be, much more brighter.</p>

  <p>You have to walk into the library, with anger, or sass, walk up to the Oracle,<br>and ask about audio books about Philosophy, Science, and then life changing biographies.</p>
  <p>Books are like vitamins,<br>they are somewhat coherent collections of components yet to be assembled in your mind.</p>
  <p>You are not supposed to understand everything at first,<br>it is hard to understand when a great being is speaking to you, their thoughts so heavy.</p>
  <p>Once you deem their ideas worthy, you might wish to consider befriending them,<br>and then try to re-construct, who they were to write like that.</p>

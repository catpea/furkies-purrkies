A legendary creature,
from a winter 17,000 years ago.
Still speaks of Might,
at the Cave of Lascaux.
It was not a hunt,
but a Magical Sight,
It was a Noble Megaloceros,
on a wintry starlit night.
A Family, and a Traveler,
Had to go out and see,
Some, said the titan was as big as a tree,
others imagined him as big as the Baltic Sea.
And the story never gets old,
after 17,000 years, it is still, being told.

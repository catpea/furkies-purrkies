A legendary creature,
from a winter 17,000 years ago.

Still speaks of Might,
at the Cave of Lascaux.

It was not a hunt,
but a Magical Sight,

It was a Noble Megaloceros,
on a wintry starlit night.

A Family, and a Traveler,
Had to go out and see,

Some, said the titan was as big as a tree,
others imagined him as big as the Baltic Sea.

And the story never gets old,
after 17,000 years, it is still, being told.

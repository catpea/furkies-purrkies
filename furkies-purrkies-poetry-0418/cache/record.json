href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afSbBjAaqeM\">JavaScript</a>, the language behind all the web applications, that also runs on the server via <a

<p>quick and dirty web servers that never complain under real stress, and desktop applications, including powerful code editors.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Above all, it all needs to be cross platform,</p>\n  <p>so that you never have to worry about rewriting your program for a different operating system.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To learn something, we need really competent teachers,</p>\n  <p>who learned what they know not from textbooks, but from experience.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If it is not possible to have good teachers,</p>\n  <p>then it is more important to lean on your own first, and then go to school to get the diploma.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If the school isn&apos;t teaching then you are not going to learn anything,</p>\n  <p>you are only going to learn something that isn&apos;t even all that useful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In closing, I would like to share with you, the most ridiculous and tiny little programming thing I have ever learned,</p>\n  <p>this is from a manual of a program unlikely to be taught in any school, the program is called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqv9Np3iAU\">CouchDB</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is just a little tidbit,</p>\n  <p>that jumped out at me, and I&apos;ve been using it like clay in my own code experiments.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When working on the web not only do you have multiple people saving data at the same time,</p>\n  <p>but also multiple instances of your program handling the traffic, usually one per CPU core.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People normally just use a database a program that is far and away,</p>\n  <p>and is designed to handle multiple connections.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But to me that adds extra complexity,</p>\n  <p>I once had MySQL database go down for no reason at all, the server was offline, perfectly configured, indexed with quality SQL, and there was nothing in the logs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At that point I was doing simple data gathering for a prestigious institution,</p>\n  <p>and the reason I used a proper database, is to avoid things getting broken like this without explanation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In that moment I promised myself to play with files a little bit more,</p>\n  <p>I wanted to find a way to save a file under the stress of multiple simultaneous connections.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Years later reading up on CouchDB, the way they stored their records,</p>\n  <p>made me jump, it was both suspicions and lovely.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I invented my own tiny theory about it,</p>\n  <p>a demand that no matter what happens, information must always be stored on disk, and as soon as it is possible.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you have many users trying to update some common piece of information,</p>\n  <p>such as the profile of a school, the chances of one overriding the other are very high.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Inspired by Couch, I create a directory, named after the file I want to save,</p>\n  <p>and then as people try to save that file, I store their information in a randomly named file inside the directory.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The first and foremost, is that all data, from all users and processes is saved,</p>\n  <p>it can never be lost, every file that I save in that directory has a long random file name that is guaranteed to be unique.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even if Alice and Bob, save Manhattan International High School Profile at the same time,</p>\n  <p>the server records their information in two different files, no data is lost.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The filenames also contain version numbers, it is possible to track conflicts,</p>\n  <p>the system can now flag when two people saved at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But more than that, the really cool part is that many servers storing files this way,</p>\n  <p>can synchronize together, as the files are always uniquely named, so thousand servers can keep in sync tracking all changes, marking wherever there are edit conflicts.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People saving data can see conflicts,</p>\n  <p>and resolve them as they make their updates.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I don&apos;t want to write too much about the details of this program,</p>\n  <p>but a conflict occurs when both Alice and Bob edit version 10 of the Manhattan International High School Profile, hit save at the same time, and call it a day.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That means that two versions 11 exist, no data is lost, but the person in charge of school profiles will see a red flag,</p>\n  <p>and may investigate, and mark one of the files as deleted.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Another notable thing is that if nobody cares to resolve the conflict,</p>\n  <p>there is this crazy way of deciding which version 11 is going to be used.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You know how those files are randomly named,</p>\n  <p>the conflicting files are sorted alphanumerically and the first one wins.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is an arbitrary election mechanism,</p>\n  <p>but no matter the circumstance, CPU core, user, or server, it is an arbitrary but consistent election process, that always returns the same winner.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What I describe here,</p>\n  <p>is saving a file.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I have a feeling that only practicing and learning on your own,</p>\n  <p>will make you sensitive, or maybe even passionate about such little gems.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even if this ever made it to a test,</p>\n  <p>how is marking that correctly on a multiple choice exam, or even even making a fake little homework program going to emphasize this as special.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And before any pro complains about using this in production,</p>\n  <p>this is a useful data backup mechanism, that should be used along side a proper database.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Learning for real is an adventure,</p>\n  <p>you make fascinating discoveries in your travel.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is better to learn on your own and then go to school to graduate,</p>\n  <p>if you still wan to.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Learning for real will also make you happy,</p>\n  <p>I enjoy experimenting with different variations of the CouchDB inspired file saving mechanism.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Visualizing data being saved without any obstruction, if statement or error,</p>\n  <p>sure makes for a fun programming session.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In school we get stressed out about passing the exams,</p>\n  <p>or trying to graduate in half the time to save money, and that is no way to learn.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That is not how a Student should be treated,</p>\n  <p>a Student represents the future of humanity, they should be treated with great dignity and respect.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think time has come to view schools that charge for education, and companies that require a diploma,</p>\n  <p>as institutions that have little talent, will eventually either lose credibility, or just go out of business.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What does a company that demands a diploma say,</p>\n  <p>about its stability and your retirement plan, what does it say about the talent that you will encounter there.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Will your co-workers be passionate about making cute little file saving discoveries,</p>\n  <p>or is it all going to be about profit maximization and promotions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Once you retire,</p>\n  <p>the real work starts.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You now enter an age where you are experienced enough to make lasting contributions,</p>\n  <p>to leave an inspired and meaningful legacy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And at this stage in your life,</p>\n  <p>having learned for real, becomes even more important, as you rely on it, to become a Great Being.</p>\n</div>",

text-center\">In closing, I would like to share with you, the most ridiculous and tiny little programming thing I have ever learned,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">this is from a manual of a program unlikely to be taught in any school, the program is called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlqv9Np3iAU\">CouchDB</a>.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">It is just a little tidbit,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">that jumped out at me, and I've been using it like clay in my own code experiments.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">When working on the web not only do you have multiple people saving data at the same time,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">but also multiple instances of your program handling the traffic, usually one per CPU core.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">People normally just use a database a program that is far and away,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and is designed to handle multiple connections.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">But to me that adds extra complexity,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I once had MySQL database go down for no reason at all, the server was offline, perfectly configured, indexed with quality SQL, and there was nothing in the logs.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">At that point I was doing simple data gathering for a prestigious institution,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and the reason I used a proper database, is to avoid things getting broken like this without explanation.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">In that moment I promised myself to play with files a little bit more,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I wanted to find a way to save a file under the stress of multiple simultaneous connections.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Years later reading up on CouchDB, the way they stored their records,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">made me jump, it was both suspicions and lovely.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I invented my own tiny theory about it,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">a demand that no matter what happens, information must always be stored on disk, and as soon as it is possible.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">If you have many users trying to update some common piece of information,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">such as the profile of a school, the chances of one overriding the other are very high.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Inspired by Couch, I create a directory, named after the file I want to save,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and then as people try to save that file, I store their information in a randomly named file inside the directory.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The first and foremost, is that all data, from all users and processes is saved,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">it can never be lost, every file that I save in that directory has a long random file name that is guaranteed to be unique.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Even if Alice and Bob, save Manhattan International High School Profile at the same time,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">the server records their information in two different files, no data is lost.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The filenames also contain version numbers, it is possible to track conflicts,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">the system can now flag when two people saved at the same time.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">But more than that, the really cool part is that many servers storing files this way,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">can synchronize together, as the files are always uniquely named, so thousand servers can keep in sync tracking all changes, marking wherever there are edit conflicts.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">People saving data can see conflicts,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and resolve them as they make their updates.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I don't want to write too much about the details of this program,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">but a conflict occurs when both Alice and Bob edit version 10 of the Manhattan International High School Profile, hit save at the same time, and call it a day.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">That means that two versions 11 exist, no data is lost, but the person in charge of school profiles will see a red flag,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and may investigate, and mark one of the files as deleted.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Another notable thing is that if nobody cares to resolve the conflict,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">there is this crazy way of deciding which version 11 is going to be used.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">You know how those files are randomly named,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">the conflicting files are sorted alphanumerically and the first one wins.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark

class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I invented my own tiny theory about it,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">a demand that no matter what

  "text": "Learning is like climbing a mountain,\nthere are no shortcuts, and you have to go step by step.\nAnd it is also like putting a computer together,\nor wiring a home entertainment center, you can't leave something out.\nIt is also like learning just a little bit about ice skating,\nyou really need to carefully step on that ice and see what it feels like.\nLearning for real, is the same as having fun,\nbeing fascinated about what you are doing, enjoying it.\nFinally, learning for real is also about long term achievement,\nlike section hiking the Appalachian Trail over many decades...\n...and then arriving at Mount Katahdin, come your golden age;\nit is about making a difference, and becoming better for it, adding to greater whole.\n\nWhen we go to school, and we end up thinking,\nif I jump through these hoops I will graduate and then I'll figure the next step.\nThe strong sequence, the integrated whole, becomes a wet rag,\nthe aim becomes a carrot on a stick, things become unclear, but we keep going.\nIt is OK to make this mistake,\nso as long as we learn from it.\nSo as long as we learn,\nand prevent others from being taken advantage of the same way.\nBegin asking questions about education,\ndon't just sit there memorizing disconnected facts, demand a real education.\n\nWe all have computers now,\nwe should all learn about programming.\nWe need to know that a function[1] takes an input,\ntransforms it, often by calling other functions, and return an output, output = function(input);\nWe need to know what a loop[2] is,\nthat it often processes a list of items, one at a time, calling functions with the item as input.\nFor example, for every user in a list,\nif membership expires soon on this user, then send warning message for this user.\nProgramming, is so simple,\nthat it only takes a few days to learn.\nYou have to do it right,\nthat is what schools were meant to help us with.\n\nFor example, YOU NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, start by just creating a file,\nand then configuring things, NO, you start with a boilerplate[3].\nOnly later, when you have time to waste,\nyou go and read the darn manual or guide[4].\nI am actually serious about this,\nthe manual will never tell you what the most important parts are relative to your use case.\nIf you just need a window with a blank canvas,\nfor a little 50 line wiki that helps you study, you don't need to worry about drop downs, or icon sizes.\nYou will return many times to the things that are useful,\nand with each use case, you will learn a new way of using the program, that is far more than any documentation can explain.\n\nAnother huge deal, is the language you start with,\nI know many programming languages but I don't use them, some are too old, but in most cases they just do things badly and are too small.\nThe language you choose must be the one getting the most stress, attention, and hate,\nbecause to hate a language is to admit to have learned the wrong one.\nToday that language is ES2021[5],\nit is the evolution of JavaScript[6], the language behind all the web applications, that also runs on the server via node.js[7].\nThere are some strong side languages that are worth considering venturing into,\nbut just bookmark them and forget it.\nYou need to learn language that will help you create cute little command line programs, mighty web apps,\nquick and dirty web servers that never complain under real stress, and desktop applications, including powerful code editors.\nAbove all, it all needs to be cross platform,\nso that you never have to worry about rewriting your program for a different operating system.\n\nTo learn something, we need really competent teachers,\nwho learned what they know not from textbooks, but from experience.\nIf it is not possible to have good teachers,\nthen it is more important to lean on your own first, and then go to school to get the diploma.\nIf the school isn't teaching then you are not going to learn anything,\nyou are only going to learn something that isn't even all that useful.\n\nIn closing, I would like to share with you, the most ridiculous and tiny little programming thing I have ever learned,\nthis is from a manual of a program unlikely to be taught in any school, the program is called CouchDB[8].\nIt is just a little tidbit,\nthat jumped out at me, and I've been using it like clay in my own code experiments.\nWhen working on the web not only do you have multiple people saving data at the same time,\nbut also multiple instances of your program handling the traffic, usually one per CPU core.\nPeople normally just use a database a program that is far and away,\nand is designed to handle multiple connections.\nBut to me that adds extra complexity,\nI once had MySQL

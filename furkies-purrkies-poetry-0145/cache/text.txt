We are all very unique,
and we are irreplaceable.

But the world is still growing,
and it may neither fit not truly inspire you.

So you have to find out what really moves you,
what makes you stand on unshakable ground.

Accepting the responsibility for your own education,
you must become authentic and unbreakable.

You have to find what inspires you,
and carry on, on that path.

Grow and develop and alter your course as fits you best,
but make sure that each day adds to the previous.

Do not alter course for unimportant reasons,
do not let strangers sway you.

Resist action without thought,
and resist following orders without thinking.

Resist red faces, and screaming authority,
and be careful because mistakes may try to sneak up on you.

Wisdom is not optional, it is the first and foremost,
and it will protect you from making your greatest mistakes.

To grow up means to become a Great Being,
in your Heart, Body, Mind, All of Your Pursuits, and Your Entire Life.

The path of growing up is built by inheriting wisdom,
from those of past generations, who have made the same effort.

Please,
take to all the books loved by Great Beings,
and begin where they left off.

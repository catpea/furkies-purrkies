YouTube user named <span>Michael Gregory has a remake of the song loaded in FL Studio<sup>[4]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and you can see what a simple setup it is, it is just about seven instruments and the vocals.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is a very famous song,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that simplicity is yet another invitation to a new tangent, that will eventually result in you becoming a world class musician.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">My interest in the piano

class=\"paragraph\">I the melody is so simple.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it in it self is a call to create a library of such simple melodies.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Beneath the melody, are chords,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and again very simple, and very beautiful.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The way notes are arranged in here is just,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">one thing, another thing, and repeat.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Walker moves up and down the scale,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">after sixteen beats or, a full measure to keep things interesting, and in harmony with melody.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But it is the same pattern,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">a-b-a-b-a-b-a-b on an on.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You can see that really well in the first 26 seconds of a video entitled,</div>\n  <div

melody.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">All of this, right at your fingertips,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you don't have to practice the piano or anything, you just reproduce the notes in the piano roll.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is such a great way to learn,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that the idea of taking a music class for this, makes me sad.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So many people are denied music,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and by the place that claims to teach it, that this is a great tragedy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">People are being tricked into thinking they are not musicians,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I don't even know

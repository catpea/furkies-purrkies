  <p>Lesson One,<br>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B6F1FV5/">Raspberry PI</a>.</p>
  <p>Putting heat sinks on the microchips,<br>and sticking everything into the enclosures.</p>
  <p>Booting into Debian Linux,<br>and playing with the command line.</p>
  <p>The PI represents endless possibilities,<br>and lessons.</p>
  <p>It calls to you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=node+js+tutorial">learn programming</a>,<br>it is really easy, start by creating your own WikiWiki.</p>
  <p>It encourages learning programming with vim,<br>and using Linux as the IDE.</p>
  <p>It invites to programming with GPIO pins,<br>a world where your code controls hardware.</p>
  <p>From relays to stepper motors,<br>and Raspberry PI powered robots, <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-hq-camera-case">PI Camera</a> and PI Zero Networks.</p>
  <p>It simply expands our grasp on technology,<br>and makes using other embedded computers understandable.</p>

  <p>Lesson Two,<br>3D Modelling.</p>
  <p>It is easier,<br>than Digital Drawing.</p>
  <p>It comes so natural and requires so little,<br>that one can't help but to create unseen things.</p>
  <p>Organic modeling is an invitation,<br>to learn to use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078YR2MTF">Drawing Tablet</a>.</p>
  <p>This is a skill as important,<br>as knowing how to use the mouse.</p>
  <p>Hard surface modeling,<br>is an introduction to industrial design.</p>
  <p>It is an urgent call,<br>to create for the 3D Printer.</p>

  <p>Lesson Three,<br>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gokN9xNG94U">3D Printer</a>.</p>
  <p>It is a Star Trek Replicator,<br>where you are the Captain, and your designs print.</p>
  <p>Be it Organic or Hard Surface Modeling,<br>you can now put your creations in the palm of your hand.</p>
  <p>From your imagination,<br>to reality.</p>
  <p>The call to create things that you can touch,<br>never ceases, the new ideas never stop.</p>

  <p>Computers and Electronics, 3D Modelling and Industrial Design,<br>and Fabrication, Creation and Iteration represent safe career paths.</p>
  <p>And when you learn something for real,<br>you also learn how to teach it for real, and enable others.</p>
  <p>These are not ordinary lessons,<br>these re true lesson.</p>
  <p>A true lesson,<br>is a lesson that changes lives.</p>
  <p>And just when you think,<br>you learned all the important parts.</p>
  <p>You will discover that you are now reasoning,<br>by subtle analogy to the new lessons that you heave learned.</p>
  <p>You will see Life and the World,<br>in a brighter light.</p>
  <p>And the more Knowledge you hold,<br>the greater your Wisdom and the closer your Greatness.</p>

  <p>Your parents should not think of school as a babysitter,<br>they need to care about you learning for real.</p>
  <p>They should care,<br>if school is working of not.</p>
  <p>Merely getting through it,<br>will rob you of knowledge.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhCHb6xtqeY">You can't really graduate from a broken school</a>,<br>real graduation requires real knowledge.</p>
  <p>If the teachers aren't teaching,<br>then like every other person in the world, they can't get paid.</p>
  <p>Cramming is not something you invented,<br>it is something you got manipulated into.</p>
  <p>Cramming, or any kind of memorization,<br>is not education, it is a trick.</p>
  <p>To know something, requires that you comprehend it,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZJj6DwCqSU">that you are able to navigate through the knowledge network within</a>.</p>

  <p>This isn't something,<br>that you can sort out later.</p>
  <p>People are selling you out for paychecks,<br>they are taking advantage of your lack of experience in life.</p>
  <p>The teachers are the men who sold the world,<br>one crappy paycheck at a time.</p>
  <p>This crime is not without consequence,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCQWvfUoFwc">Vaccine Hesitancy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1Jud3zOcL4">Loss Of Species</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAZAKPUQMw0">Loss of The Amazon</a>...</p>

  <p>Until the world is ready to see that schools are not working,<br>you need to take the responsibility for your own education.</p>
  <p>It has never been more pleasant,<br>Narrated Books, quality Lectures, and enlightening Internet Videos make self education easy.</p>
  <p>But you really need to push for it,<br>you need to break away from the Standardized Curriculum.</p>
  <p>You have to build your own educational path,<br>in the sequence that matches you best, at the right pace, and driven by your greatest questions.</p>
  <p>That is how you build Knowledge Networks,<br>and they function the same way as Memory Palaces.</p>
  <p>When you learn things that are relevant to you,<br>to the best version of your elder self, it stays with you for life.</p>
  <p>Not only that,<br>but the things you learn for real also teach you <strong>how</strong> to think.</p>
  <p>How to spot liars and manipulators, how to be strong,<br>and how to think like the Great Beings and Authors you admire.</p>

  <p>When you learn for real you don't just walk away with a formula,<br>you make friends across history, you reinvent-along with them in a way.</p>
  <p>The gravity of theft of real knowledge and proper comprehension,<br>is greater than all the other disaster combined.</p>
  <p>Because fake education is an attack,<br>an attack that aims to disable you.</p>

  <p>There is no conspiracy,<br>the teachers aren't fully aware of what they are doing, their education is fake too.</p>
  <p>If you were to gather all the teachers and principals one in a room,<br>and show them the consequences of their fraud.</p>
  <p>All they could say, is,<br>"How were we supposed to know?"</p>
  <p>They won't even suspect that poverty fractured them,<br>they will swear by their education and paychecks, and experience.</p>
  <p>Without real education the world can't even see,<br>the invisible toxic prison walls of poverty.</p>
  <p>Without real education,<br>We can't grow out of our mistakes.</p>
  <p>The World is asking you,<br>and your generation to become Great Beings.</p>
  <p>Help the world learn for real,<br>and understand, and comprehend.</p>
  <p>In the absence of teachers,<br>you must become a teacher.</p>

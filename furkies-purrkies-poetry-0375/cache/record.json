  "text": "Evolution, or perhaps it is little more than chance,\nmade it so that we have a tendency to follow.\nRichard Dawkins[1] demonstrates that very well in his\n\"What If You Are Wrong?[2]\" response.\nWe will believe in things that we are born to,\nwhat surrounds us becomes our reality.\nThe individuals born with a tendency to question elders,\nare forced to abandon their ways, or worse.\n\nPandemics are an eye opening moment,\nit is the beings that questioned religions,\nthat initially inspired the sciences.\nAny religion that attacks the vaccines,\nwill quickly change its mind,\nor perish.\n\nReality,\nalways wins.\nThere is no point arguing against reality,\nit makes us better, stronger, reliable, dignified.\n\nBut just because you know all this,\ndoes not mean that this is simple.\nPhilip Zimbardo, and Daniel Amen,\nbring up some extremely powerful research.\n\nMany of us have heard of the The Stanford Prison Experiment[3],\nwhere ordinary people all of a sudden become terrible when given the role of guard.\nBut Dear Philip Zimbardo,\ndidn't stop at the prison, I believe he immediately understood what was going on.\nHe might have even created The Stanford Prison Experiment,\nto test a theory.\nThe theory of how our surroundings,\ninfluence our mental health.\nPersonally, by surroundings I mean the whole thing,\nfrom the cubicle walls, to weasel CEOs, to do nothing approach in politics, all the way out to active concentration camps and legal slavery.\nSee,\nMr. Zimbardo is correct.\nNot only must we learn to become Knowledge,\nbut we have to reject all the evil, injustice, and mediocrity that has become the norm.\nIf we don't reject all the ongoing mistakes,\nwe will become ill, it will get to us.\nSo you are not just on a quest to become Knowledgabe and Wise,\nbut also on a quest to reject all the wrong things that have become the norm.\nHere is Mr. Zimbardo explaining what I mean in the first 59 seconds of his talk entitled:\nTEDxMidwest - Phil Zimbardo - Heroes[4]\nWe have to alter the entire Human Environment,\nof course reality is on our side.\n\nTo take prisons as example, Daniel Amen explains a new insight into the criminal mind,\nsee The most important lesson from 83,000 brain scans by Daniel Amen[5].\nTo repeat that Dostoyevsky quote:\n\"A society should be judged not by how it treats its outstanding citizens, but by how it treats its criminals.\"\nThis is correct, prisons were always unethical, but Daniel Amen explains why,\nmany of those people are very ill, and the environment of the prison and the hopelessness that they from thinking about us being our here, is making them even more ill.\nHouse arrest is fine, crazy long community service is not too bad so as long as it involves minimum wage,\nbut our best approach is preventing people from entering a life of crime, that is exactly what Mr. Zimbardo is going.\nHe is helping children resist the influence that their environment has on them,\nhis legacy is not going to be the Prison Experiment, but the Heroic Imagination Project.\n\nAs we become more and more knowledgeable and wise, and strong,\nwe have to learn to stand against what is wrong with the world.\nIt is not just about us being Knowledgeable and Wise,\nbut also helping others to see the countless things that made us that way.\nThis is called Greatness, becoming strong on the inside,\nand then making Wise, Meaningful, Inspirational and Lasting constructions to our word, and encouraging others to do the same.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFZTbD6Fno4\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd1dM1lJoSY\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XN2X72jrFk\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzRR3Mo4noU\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esPRsT-lmw8",

  <p>Without your writings poetry will die,<br>you are a poet, and that is not a lie,</p>
  <p>You don't create to fit a poem or a chapter, or a flap of wings,<br>your creation comes <strong>first</strong> and actually redefines those things.</p>
  <p>Your treasures are not defined by what fits some particular box,<br>but how you create and share <strong>new</strong> and <strong>original</strong> building blocks.</p>
  <p>Completing other people's thoughts, unraveling their delusions,<br>and maybe even preventing the spread of illusions.</p>
  <p>A book means nothing if written by a robot that can't feel,<br>the Human is the foremost, that's what makes the poem it real.</p>
  <p>It is time for you to begin to write,<br>every day, one sentence, by twilight.</p>

  <p>You can write on your hand with a pen,<br>but you will want a journal to save it every now and then.</p>
  <p>You are already a poet right now,<br>you don't need to know how.</p>
  <p>It was in you all along,<br>and it is lifelong.</p>
  <p>All you need to do to write,<br>is to chain the words that fit right.</p>
  <p>Keep it as short as you can,<br>that's the best plan.</p>
  <p>Stanza by stanza it will all add,<br>and you'll have your first poem in your notepad.</p>

  <p>Rhyming is actually quite ordinary,<br>just need a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rhyming+dictionary">rhyming dictionary</a>.</p>
  <p>Your wisdom is the big deal,<br>growing wiser is the poetry's appeal.</p>
  <p>One of the people you write to,<br>is the elder you.</p>
  <p>Every one of your rhyming lines,<br>eventually create lifelines.</p>
  <p>As you grow wiser and stronger,<br>your poems will become longer.</p>
  <p>But it is best that you start right now,<br>let your dreams show you how.</p>

  <p>But there is more to it of course,<br>poetry is also an expression of your life force.</p>
  <p>Right at the center of your being,<br>lies the power of seeing.</p>
  <p>Your goodness, wisdom, authenticity, sight,<br>give you unbrekability and infinite might.</p>
  <p>Poetry reaches beyond any and all limitations,<br>as it can last for countless generations.</p>
  <p>The ideas you write down today,<br>will change the world someday.</p>
  <p>Everyone gets to have their say,<br>so write in your own way.</p>
  <p>Because poetry was in you all along,<br>and you are plenty strong.</p>
  <p>May you never forget and forever know,<br>that your words are meant to help Humanity Grow.</p>

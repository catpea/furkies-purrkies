I awoke,
a slowpoke.

I marched and down the stairs,
taking care of morning morning affairs.

I had a new chapter to pen,
it is that day again.

I am so happy that I will dance next tomorrow,
why I rest on weekends, I don't know.

I wan to go back to dancing two hours every day,
this pandemic must end - I say.

El Capitan!

A chapter flashed in my mind,
but something else I must find.

I don't speak Spanish though I do hear the gales,
I am an ancient man that likes but short trails.

I printed a second wallet, as an art piece,
arr, the printing, doth not cease.

Ulysses! Ulysses! Mr. Joyce could make the chapter,
it would be like creating a perfect walk, and unleashing a velociraptor.

But what would I call a new mixed thing,
I have Maverick and Connoisseur already, The King?

Sociologist!

Alas, academia tarnishes names,
a Name that can open with James.

The Thinker,
the new chapter is the thinker.

The Thinker, THE THINKER,
or should it be The Free Thinker.

Keep it simple Meow!,
The thinker will do for now.

I am going to bring in all my heroes,
including the powerful ATHENA who can turn armored men to zeroes.

Mr. Vasili Arkhipov, and Ms. Goldson again,
the Thinkers who save the world, and make it sane.


(I can't believe she called her teacher Eccentric,
it looked like that was the only teacher there, Ms. Goldson got it backwards.

You know between Stanislav Petrov and Vasili Arkhipov,
we really do need a Thinker, that will help the world see.

We are one family you know,
borders are a blight, obviously, a Hero is a Hero, no matter what nation they are from)

Whoopsie forgot my rhymes,
good times, good times.

Anywho,
we resume, without further ado.

I got my chapter now,
so everything is meow.

Ooh,
and it looks like I got the poem too.

And the morning turned to noon,
maybe I can finish by the end of afternoon.

Poems are very hard,
thank goodness that Joyce taught us Art.

If all my work had to fit in a square,
it would be both unfair and not fit to share.

So the moral of the story,
is that you too are a poet, and should never be sorry.

You don't create to fit a poem or a chapter, or a flap of wings,
your creation comes first and actually redefines those things.

Your treasures are not defined by what fits some particular box,
but how you create and share new and original building blocks.

Completing other peoples thoughts, unraveling their delusions,
and maybe even preventing the spread of illusions.

A book means nothing if written by a robot that can't feel,
the Human is the foremost, that's what mes it real.

It is time for you to begin to write,
every day, one sentence - by twilight.

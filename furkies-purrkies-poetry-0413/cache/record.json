up,</p>\n  <p>and I tried to push away his bully.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Who was an A student,</p>\n  <p>and an addict.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not only did the two turn on me,</p>\n  <p>but my main bully joined in two.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I don&apos;t fight,</p>\n  <p>because that would only make me a bully.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But, when I am in danger,</p>\n  <p>everyone is going to be pushed away.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The fight came to an abrupt end,</p>\n  <p>as my bully was already hurt, probably from his father.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>SO the teachers got around,</p>\n  <p>for the first time in five years bullying was noticed.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Except that when I got back to my classroom,</p>\n  <p>the smartest of the girls, told me that they don&apos;t want me there anymore.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just about at the same moment,</p>\n  <p>the school shrink came in, put her hand on my shoulder and said everything is OK.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The two that originally started the fight,</p>\n  <p>begun lying that I started the fight.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I told the psychologist to grill them until they start telling the truth,</p>\n  <p>and she finally got the real story out of them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And they got punished,</p>\n  <p>I didn&apos;t do anything wrong other than pushing my bullies away.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Each of them, including the little one tried to fight me before,</p>\n  <p>I still didn&apos;t want the little guy to get beaten up, I know what it is like.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Few days later, my main bully, invited college kids to teach me a lesson,</p>\n  <p>they actually came into to the school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I did not see the kick,</p>\n  <p>he must have been standing behind me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I didn&apos;t really get hurt,</p>\n  <p>but I stayed on the ground to be safe.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Russian language teacher saw me down,</p>\n  <p>and didn&apos;t do anything.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When I made it to class,</p>\n  <p>the bully that invited the older boys to teach me a lesson, was laughing at me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think the side of my face was red from the kick,</p>\n  <p>they would have been arrested if I knew to call the police.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I am certain they had knives,</p>\n  <p>there were four to six of them, they had look outs by the stairs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My main bully was lying that I was beating him up,</p>\n  <p>it was either because his father was abusing him.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Or because his father was teaching him to shit on other people,</p>\n  <p>he was telling his kid how to destroy me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Since I assumed this always happens to everyone,</p>\n  <p>I was fine, a little lonely.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>After the big bullies came,</p>\n  <p>it was dangerous to go back to school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So I went the other way,</p>\n  <p>wisely.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I saw my main bully watching me,</p>\n  <p>waiting for the buss that goes the other way.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They were jealous, they laughed,</p>\n  <p>who knows.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Th first time I crossed the street to wait for the bus that goes the other way,</p>\n  <p>meant I dropped out of school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My parents were already angry for me pushing bullies away,</p>\n  <p>after five years of taking their punches, but I didn&apos;t care.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I was not a victim,</p>\n  <p>I was a warrior.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I won every one of those fights,</p>\n  <p>by not hurting them back.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Each time they came to attack me,</p>\n  <p>I became stronger, nobler, more powerful, smarter, more independent.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Isolation didn&apos;t hurt me either,</p>\n  <p>all I ever knew was bullying, and being alone, I used to enjoy it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I had a Commodore 64, and I used Simon&apos;s Basic to teach myself about pixels,</p>\n  <p>I never liked playing computer games, I still don&apos;t.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But, I kept current, with every major game release,</p>\n  <p>I carefully paid attention, to the pixels.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McXJj7sjcZ0\">Souls games</a> are my favorite, of course,</p>\n  <p>never payed them but they are each a masterpiece.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That where the buss took me,</p>\n  <p>it took me into the world of Pixel Art.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It was an old underground World War 2 bunker,</p>\n  <p>that was filled with Arcade Games.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If I didn&apos;t go back to school,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFqBkSJOYOQ\">I would have been coding my own intros, I would have become part of the demo scene</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I would have mastered it all,</p>\n  <p>but I went back, but it took the teachers four months to catch on that I was gone.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Four amazing months,</p>\n  <p>I never had the money to play games, I would only watch others play it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My favorites were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LhEovW4Uqw\">Asterix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9DE-KyZnLc\">The Simpsons</a> by Konami,</p>\n  <p>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI284D4y1q4\">Street Fighter II</a> by Capcom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I also enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb_7PyfwbmU\">Wonder Boy</a>,</p>\n  <p>I just think it is really neat.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even after I graduated that strange place,</p>\n  <p>and went to a much nicer school bullies were there.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The older they get the creeper they become,</p>\n  <p>one kid actually freaked out, as I didn&apos;t pull my hand away, I bet he still remembers that smell.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The biggest bully there, that seemed like a normal person,</p>\n  <p>was actually a neo nazi, I wasn&apos;t scared but I kept my distance.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It was time to pack by that time,</p>\n  <p>I ended up in Brooklyn, NY.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And again, as I was waking back from school,</p>\n  <p>the local boxer kid, started punching me in the back of my head.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Brooklyn was my home though,</p>\n  <p>I called the police, I told them I would not press charges.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>While they said they couldn&apos;t do anything,</p>\n  <p>they were all gone.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Before I moved to the state I am in now,</p>\n  <p>the bully walked by me and using the F word explained that he does not like Poles, as in polish people.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I was too scared to say anything,</p>\n  <p>but most of the polish people I knew were very cruel to me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I always tried to make friends,</p>\n  <p>but, it was difficult.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The part of me that made me win every fight without fighting,</p>\n  <p>by being strong, and dignified.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Is not comfortable around people that do alcohol, drugs,</p>\n  <p>that go to bars, and live in that creepy culture of get plastered, get stoned, get laid, get wasted, lie, cheat, and steal.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I became strong, not by running away from fights,</p>\n  <p>but by not punching back, by taking the hardest path, and the easy roads are just not for me, they are frightening.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I tried to help many people in my journeys,</p>\n  <p>but help must come from within.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>One time I mumbled something about helping people a decade back, at a Chinese restaurant near by,</p>\n  <p>and a lady almost yelled at me &quot;That is not your problem, not your responsibility.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I admitted to her &quot;I know that now.&quot;,</p>\n  <p>but before I thought we had to help each other.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I never really helped anyone get out of any trouble,</p>\n  <p>I think it was because I didn&apos;t look like a wise old man.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nobody was listening to me,</p>\n  <p>but I tried!</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My big advice, is to remember the Dean, the principal, the police,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t let anybody push you around.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you get an unfair grade,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t just stand there like I did - go to the principal, and make yourself at home.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are too scared to speak, say so,</p>\n  <p>&quot;I have trouble speaking because I am scared, please give me a moment to gather my thoughts.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If bullies come after you, you have to call the police, to help them,</p>\n  <p>the police needs to investigate their parents.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No child is born a bully, the worst of them are victims of abuse, if you get the police on it early,</p>\n  <p>then you maybe able to save your bullie&apos;s mind from permanent damage, where they stay a bully for life.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My last piece of advice is tough,</p>\n  <p>if you drop out, that is life telling you that you don&apos;t belong there.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>See, I went back to school because I was scared of becoming homeless,</p>\n  <p>but poverty is an error, it is not meant to be your driving force.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Poverty is a mistake that Humanity didn&apos;t know it made,</p>\n  <p>poverty is not your fault.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have to fight the errors,</p>\n  <p>you have to challenge poverty with knowledge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not spend your life time running away from it,</p>\n  <p>or towards some stick and carrot promotion.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If the schools fail you,</p>\n  <p>then you go to the library.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Audio Books started flourishing just about ten years ago,</p>\n  <p>this is the first time in Human history that we can really get into books, without any effort.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t drop out completely,</p>\n  <p>for one the kids in the back row need to understand that they are not stupid, they are just too mature to memorize garbage.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Call out the teachers,</p>\n  <p>the curriculum, write to the local newspaper.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4\">The Deans and Principals know that schools are bullshit</a>,</p>\n  <p>at the very least they owe you lunch.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you just rise above the nonsense,</p>\n  <p>the constant memorization of noise, the overwhelming mediocrity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your mind will grow,</p>\n  <p>flourish.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Get your mittens on all the books about education,</p>\n  <p>mass incarceration, politics and corporate fraud, and try to figure out how everything works.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If your Biology teacher proclaims &quot;Weed to be an herb.&quot;, like mine did,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t just drop out like I did.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Get up, and say &quot;Let&apos;s see what your employer has to say about that&quot;,</p>\n  <p>go to the Principles office, and face the wrath that will come from it all.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Learn to stand up for what is right,</p>\n  <p>because this is your world, by the time you are their age they will have long retired, and will care even less.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWQq0E8ENSc\">The world needs Heroes</a>, those who stand up for truth,</p>\n  <p>and learn to find entertainment in rage and anger that is causes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I didn&apos;t let years of bulling hurt me at all,</p>\n  <p>I became stronger and wiser for it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If misfortune finds you,</p>\n  <p>rise up, back away, and forge your own path in life, aim away from mediocrity, and the easier wrong.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Misfortune, especially one that you can&apos;t help, is good training,</p>\n  <p>it will make you a ridiculously overpowered warrior, and a ridiculously cheerful one too.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Besides, the moment you rise above your troubles,</p>\n  <p>you come into the company of all the great warriors an thinkers, prophets and philosophers, dreamers and artists that came before you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can&apos;t allow yourself to be stressed out by broken schools and equally broken bullies,</p>\n  <p>or anything that is broken, that is not mean to drive you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is your life,</p>\n  <p>and you are meant to bloom towards greatness.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You must not hide or run away from broken things,</p>\n  <p>we are all meant to become great beings.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And if you become lonely, use that to your advantage too, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug\">take to the trails</a>,</p>\n  <p>and remember what Henry said.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,</p>\n  <p>and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>\n  <p>I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</p>\n  <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,</p>\n  <p>to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...&quot;</p>\n</div>",

been arrested if I knew to call the police.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I am certain they had knives,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there were four to six of them, they had look outs by the stairs.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

<div class=\"paragraph\">I was fine, a little lonely.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">After the big bullies came,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it was dangerous to go back to school.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So I went the other way,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">wisely.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section

taking their punches, but I didn't care.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I was not a victim,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I was a warrior.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I won every one of those fights,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">by not hurting them back.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Each time they came to attack me,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I became stronger, nobler, more powerful, smarter, more independent.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Isolation didn't hurt me either,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">all I ever knew was bullying, and being alone, I used to enjoy it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section

I used Simon's Basic to teach myself about pixels,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I never liked playing computer games, I still don't.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But, I kept current, with every major game release,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I carefully paid attention, to the pixels.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><span>Souls games<sup>[1]</sup></span> are my favorite, of course,</div>\n

class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">That where the buss took me,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it took me into the world of Pixel Art.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It was an old underground World War 2 bunker,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that was filled with Arcade Games.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If I didn't go back to

to catch on that I was gone.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Four amazing months,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I never had the money to play games, I would only watch others play it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

<br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Even after I graduated that strange place,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and went to a much nicer school bullies were there.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The older they get the creeper they become,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">one kid actually freaked out, as I didn't pull my hand away, I bet he still remembers that smell.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The biggest bully there, that seemed like a normal person,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">was actually a neo nazi, I wasn't scared but I kept my distance.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It was time to pack by that time,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I ended up in Brooklyn, NY.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And again, as I was waking back from school,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the local boxer kid, started punching me in the back of my head.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Brooklyn was my home though,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I called the police, I told them I would not press charges.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">While they said they couldn't do anything,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they were all gone.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom:

polish people.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I was too scared to say anything,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but most of the polish people I knew were very cruel to me.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I always tried to make friends,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but, it was difficult.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The part of me that made me win every fight without fighting,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">by being strong, and dignified.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Is not comfortable around people that do alcohol, drugs,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that go to bars, and live in that creepy culture of get plastered, get stoned, get laid, get wasted, lie, cheat, and steal.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I became strong, not by running away from fights,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but by not punching back, by taking the hardest path, and the easy roads are just not for me, they are frightening.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I tried to help many people in my journeys,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but help must come from within.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">One time I mumbled something about helping people a decade back, at a Chinese restaurant near by,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and a lady almost yelled at me \"That is not your problem, not your responsibility.\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I admitted to her \"I know that now.\",</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but before I thought we had to help each other.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I never really helped anyone get out of any trouble,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I think it was because I didn't look like a wise old man.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Nobody was listening to me,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but I tried!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">My big advice, is to remember the Dean, the principal, the police,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">don't let anybody push you around.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If you get an unfair grade,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">don't just stand there like I did - go to the principal, and make yourself at home.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If you are too scared to speak, say so,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">\"I have trouble speaking because I am scared, please give me a moment to gather my thoughts.\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If bullies come after you, you have to call the police, to help them,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the police needs to investigate their parents.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">No child is born a bully, the worst of them are victims of abuse, if you get the police on it early,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">then you maybe able to save your bullie's mind from permanent damage, where they stay a bully for life.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">My last piece of advice is tough,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">if you drop out, that is life telling you that you don't belong there.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">See, I went back to school because I was scared of becoming homeless,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but poverty is an error, it is not meant to be your driving force.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom:

avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You have to fight the errors,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you have to challenge poverty with knowledge.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Not spend your life time running away from it,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">or towards some stick and carrot promotion.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If the schools

  "text": "I know this sounds like basic advice,\nbut this is tough.\nSchool was double trouble for me,\nnot only was it nonsense, but it also came with bullies.\nIt was dangerous, so I stopped going,\nit never occurred to me to call the police.\nI thought everyone was getting bullied,\nI didn't even complain to the school.\nI didn't complain about my bad grades in programming,\nthe teacher marked me down because he got angry that I was copying.\nIt never occurred to me to go to the principal,\nthe bullies were already laughing.\n\nThere was this short kid getting beaten up,\nand I tried to push away his bully.\nWho was an A student,\nand an addict.\nNot only did the two turn on me,\nbut my main bully joined in two.\nI don't fight,\nbecause that would only make me a bully.\nBut, when I am in danger,\neveryone is going to be pushed away.\n\nThe fight came to an abrupt end,\nas my bully was already hurt, probably from his father.\nSO the teachers got around,\nfor the first time in five years bullying was noticed.\nExcept that when I got back to my classroom,\nthe smartest of the girls, told me that they don't want me there anymore.\nJust about at the same moment,\nthe school shrink came in, put her hand on my shoulder and said everything is OK.\nThe two that originally started the fight,\nbegun lying that I started the fight.\nI told the psychologist to grill them until they start telling the truth,\nand she finally got the real story out of them.\nAnd they got punished,\nI didn't do anything wrong other than pushing my bullies away.\nEach of them, including the little one tried to fight me before,\nI still didn't want the little guy to get beaten up, I know what it is like.\n\nFew days later, my main bully, invited college kids to teach me a lesson,\nthey actually came into to the school.\nI did not see the kick,\nhe must have been standing behind me.\nI didn't really get hurt,\nbut I stayed on the ground to be safe.\nThe Russian language teacher saw me down,\nand didn't do anything.\nWhen I made it to class,\nthe bully that invited the older boys to teach me a lesson, was laughing at me.\nI think the side of my face was red from the kick,\nthey would have been arrested if I knew to call the police.\nI am certain they had knives,\nthere were four to six of them, they had look outs by the stairs.\nMy main bully was lying that I was beating him up,\nit was either because his father was abusing him.\nOr because his father was teaching him to shit on other people,\nhe was telling his kid how to destroy me.\nSince I assumed this always happens to everyone,\nI was fine, a little lonely.\nAfter the big bullies came,\nit was dangerous to go back to school.\nSo I went the other way,\nwisely.\n\nI saw my main bully watching me,\nwaiting for the buss that goes the other way.\nThey were jealous, they laughed,\nwho knows.\n\nTh first time I crossed the street to wait for the bus that goes the other way,\nmeant I dropped out of school.\nMy parents were already angry for me pushing bullies away,\nafter five years of taking their punches, but I didn't care.\nI was not a victim,\nI was a warrior.\nI won every one of those fights,\nby not hurting them back.\nEach time they came to attack me,\nI became stronger, nobler, more powerful, smarter, more independent.\nIsolation didn't hurt me either,\nall I ever knew was bullying, and being alone, I used to enjoy it.\n\nI had a Commodore 64, and I used Simon's Basic to teach myself about pixels,\nI never liked playing computer games, I still don't.\nBut, I kept current, with every major game release,\nI carefully paid attention, to the pixels.\nSouls games[1] are my favorite, of course,\nnever payed them but they are each a masterpiece.\n\nThat where the buss took me,\nit took me into the world of Pixel Art.\nIt was an old underground World War 2 bunker,\nthat was filled with Arcade Games.\nIf I didn't go back to school,\nI would have been coding my own intros, I would have become part of the demo scene[2].\nI would have mastered it all,\nbut I went back, but it took the teachers four months to catch on that I was gone.\nFour amazing months,\nI never had the money to play games, I would only watch others play it.\nMy favorites were Asterix[3] and The Simpsons[4] by Konami,\nand Street Fighter II[5] by Capcom.\nI also enjoyed Wonder Boy[6],\nI just think it is really neat.\n\nEven after I graduated that strange place,\nand went to a much nicer school bullies were there.\nThe older they get the creeper they become,\none kid actually freaked out, as I didn't pull my hand away, I bet he still remembers that smell.\nThe biggest bully there, that seemed like a normal person,\nwas actually a neo nazi, I wasn't scared but I kept my distance.\n\nIt was time to pack by that time,\nI ended up in Brooklyn, NY.\nAnd again, as I was waking back from school,\nthe local boxer kid, started punching me in the back of my head.\nBrooklyn was my home though,\nI called the police, I told them I would not press charges.\nWhile they said they couldn't do anything,\nthey were all gone.\nBefore I moved to the state I am in now,\nthe bully walked by me and using the F word explained that he does not like Poles, as in polish people.\nI was too scared to say anything,\nbut most of the polish people I knew were very cruel to me.\n\nI always tried to make friends,\nbut, it was difficult.\nThe part of me that made me win every fight without fighting,\nby being strong, and dignified.\nIs not comfortable around people that do alcohol, drugs,\nthat go to bars, and live in that creepy culture of get plastered, get stoned, get laid, get wasted, lie, cheat, and steal.\nI became strong, not by running away from fights,\nbut by not punching back, by taking the hardest path, and the easy roads are just not for me, they are frightening.\nI tried to help many people in my journeys,\nbut help must come from within.\nOne time I mumbled something about helping people a decade back, at a Chinese restaurant near by,\nand a lady almost yelled at me \"That is not your problem, not your responsibility.\"\nI admitted to her \"I know that now.\",\nbut before I thought we had to help each other.\nI never really helped anyone get out of any trouble,\nI think it was because I didn't look like a wise old man.\nNobody was listening to me,\nbut I tried!\n\nMy big advice, is to remember the Dean, the principal, the police,\ndon't let anybody push you around.\nIf you get an unfair grade,\ndon't just stand there like I did - go to the principal, and make yourself at home.\nIf you are too scared to speak, say so,\n\"I have trouble speaking because I am scared, please give me a moment to gather my thoughts.\"\nIf bullies come after you, you have to call the police, to help them,\nthe police needs to investigate their parents.\nNo child is born a bully, the worst of them are victims of abuse, if you get the police on it early,\nthen you maybe able to save your bullie's mind from permanent damage, where they stay a bully for life.\n\nMy last piece of advice is tough,\nif you drop out, that is life telling you that you don't belong there.\nSee, I went back to school because I was scared of becoming homeless,\nbut poverty is an error, it is not meant to be your driving force.\nPoverty is a mistake that Humanity didn't know it made,\npoverty is not your fault.\nYou have to fight the errors,\nyou have to challenge poverty with knowledge.\nNot spend your life time running away from it,\nor towards some stick and carrot promotion.\nIf the schools fail you,\nthen you go to the library.\nAudio Books started flourishing just about ten years ago,\nthis is the first time in Human history that we can really get into books, without any effort.\nDon't drop out completely,\nfor one the kids in the back row need to understand that they are not stupid, they are just too mature to memorize garbage.\nCall out the teachers,\nthe curriculum, write to the local newspaper.\nThe Deans and Principals know that schools are bullshit[7],\nat the very least they owe you lunch.\n\nIf you just rise above the nonsense,\nthe constant memorization of noise, the overwhelming mediocrity.\nYour mind will grow,\nflourish.\nGet your mittens on all the books about education,\nmass incarceration, politics and corporate fraud, and try to figure out how everything works.\nIf your Biology teacher proclaims \"Weed to be an herb.\", like mine did,\ndon't just drop out like I did.\nGet up, and say \"Let's see what your employer has to say about that\",\ngo to the Principles office, and face the wrath that will come from it all.\nLearn to stand up for what is right,\nbecause this is your world, by the time you are their age they will have long retired, and will care even less.\nThe world needs Heroes[8], those who stand up for truth,\nand learn to find entertainment in rage and anger that is causes.\n\nI didn't let years of bulling hurt me at all,\nI became stronger and wiser for it.\nIf misfortune finds you,\nrise up, back away, and forge your own path in life, aim away from mediocrity, and the easier wrong.\nMisfortune, especially one that you can't help, is good training,\nit will make you a ridiculously overpowered warrior, and a ridiculously cheerful one too.\nBesides, the moment you rise above your troubles,\nyou come into the company of all the great warriors an thinkers, prophets and philosophers, dreamers and artists that came before you.\nYou can't allow yourself to be stressed out by broken schools and equally broken bullies,\nor anything that is broken, that is not mean to drive you.\nThis is your life,\nand you are meant to bloom towards greatness.\nYou must not hide or run away from broken things,\nwe are all meant to become great beings.\nAnd if you become lonely, use that to your advantage too, take to the trails[9],\nand remember what Henry said.\n\"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,\nand not, when I came to die, discover that I had

Somehow, Wednesday turned out to be the tiniest day.
I was quiet all day, slowly programming away.
I've been thinking about my bicycle, birds, and rain,
but mostly working on my new website domain.
My bicycle trails have been calling me all week,
I prepared my bicycle and am I ready, so to speak.
There was much rain today,
it will take a few more days, before I pedal away.
It is not always about the adventure,
I love how all the spring trees smell.
How the birds sing in the morning,
how the air is crisp and new.
I never set a plan as to how far I will ride,
I just get on the bicycle and enjoy the outside.
Every once in a while I perch upon an overpass,
scribble code, or just watch the cars sometimes.
There are many memorable places along the way,
they are all very tiny and hidden away.
Old graffiti, sculptures and parks, abandoned railway,
I could talk about them all day.

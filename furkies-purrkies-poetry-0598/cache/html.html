  <p>We learn philosophy layer by layer,<br>first we take what we understand.</p>
  <p>And upon considering that,<br>we are now able to understand a little bit more.</p>
  <p>Some philosophers consider,<br>that we may wish to discard the ladder once we are done using it.</p>
  <p>And even paint a ceiling,<br>beyond-which things are nonsense.</p>
  <p>Ludwig Wittgenstein warns us:<br>“Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muß man schweigen.”</p>
  <p>which is translated as:<br>"Whereof one cannot speak [of things with much sense], thereof one must be silent."</p>

  <p>Philosophers construct things,<br>they go too far, or fall short all the time.</p>
  <p>Socrates who encourages us with:</p>
  <p>"Employ your time in improving yourself by other men's writings,<br>so that you shall come easily-by, what others have labored hard for."</p>
  <p>Also adds,</p>
  <p>"Do not mind whether the teachers of philosophy are good or bad,<br>but think only of philosophy herself."</p>
  <p>On the other end of this spectrum,<br>are people whose ideas are so beautiful that they make other scientists say "it lacks clinical grounding".</p>
  <p>I really appreciate this short little ladder about growing up that Jane Loevinger created,<br>see "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loevinger%27s_stages_of_ego_development">Loevinger's stages of ego development</a>".</p>
  <p>In her last stage she says "learning is understood as unavoidable ... the unattainable is renounced.",<br>I personally think this as beautiful.</p>

  <p>We need to consider that schools are not working very well,<br>that scientist maybe spending too much time comparing rats to humans</p>
  <p>Things to strive for, inspirations, projections, even daydreaming about philosophers, warriors or superheroes,<br>are really good for us.</p>

  <p>The way I learned to see science, is as a product of philosophy,<br>so if something does not fit Psychology for lack of clinical grounding.</p>
  <p>It is put back into the broader field of Philosophy,<br>if Loevinger's stages of ego development are not compatible with psychology, then it is a Philosophical System.</p>
  <p>Perhaps one pending the invention of a new field of Psychology,<br>one where rats are not used to model human behavior.</p>

  <p>On the subject of Philosophy, Socrates goes on to say:</p>
  <p>"Try and examine her well and truly, and if she be evil seek to turn away all men from her [...];<br>but if she be what I believe that she is,<br>then follow her and serve her, [...] and be of good cheer."</p>
  <p>Socrates is so wonderful here,<br>that Will Durant used this quote in his introduction to <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Story-of-Philosophy-Audiobook/B0044EQEIA">The Story Of Philosophy</a></p>

  <p>Tragically, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBmlRihA9_s">schools do not present philosophy correctly</a>,<br>in turn emerging this abomination we call academic philosophy.</p>
  <p>The best way to get at it, is to start early, and with books and lectures similar in spirit to The Story Of Philosophy by Durant,<br>introduction to personalities and their best ideas.</p>
  <p>And just listen, taking only that which is useful to us,<br>things that we appreciate and understand.</p>
  <p>There are things in Philosophy that are a kind of nonsense for which there may not be time in life,<br>we should always remember Ludwig Wittgenstein and stick to the things that work for us, that are good.</p>
  <p>Now, the really interesting thing is that the second time you read or listen to a book or lecture about philosophy,<br>you will get more out of it, as you have integrated, internalized, adopt the things you learned before.</p>
  <p>What was previously difficult to grasp,<br>now will seems reasonable, and this process will continue as you internalize more.</p>

  <p>I will close with a thought on Jane Lovenger's work,<br>I think in the distant future as Humanity progresses forward, her work will be recognized as something very useful.</p>
  <p>Future schools may even use stages of development as a tool used in guiding students forward,<br>showing them where they should be headed to secure World Peace, Human Dignity, and continued Advancement of Human Kind.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">On the other end of this spectrum,<br>are people whose ideas are so beautiful that they make other scientists say "it lacks clinical grounding".</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I really appreciate this short little ladder about growing up that Jane Loevinger created,<br>see "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loevinger%27s_stages_of_ego_development">Loevinger's stages of ego development</a>".</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In her last stage she says "learning is understood as unavoidable ... the unattainable is renounced.",<br>I personally think this as beautiful.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The best way to get at it, is to start early, and with books and lectures similar in spirit to The Story Of Philosophy by Durant,<br>introduction to personalities and their best ideas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And just listen, taking only that which is useful to us,<br>things that we appreciate and understand.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There are things in Philosophy that are a kind of nonsense for which there may not be time in life,<br>we should always remember Ludwig Wittgenstein and stick to the things that work for us, that are good.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Now, the really interesting thing is that the second time you read or listen to a book or lecture about philosophy,<br>you will get more out of it, as you have integrated, internalized, adopt the things you learned before.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What was previously difficult to grasp,<br>now will seems reasonable, and this process will continue as you internalize more.</div>

  <p>In computer world,<br>the power of infinity is the first lessons we learn.</p>
  <p>Be it a while(true){} loop,<br>or 10 GOTO 10;</p>
  <p>The beginning is more than all the superhero stories put together,<br>and the first step forward is nothing short of extraordinary.</p>

  <p>Some of us will be drawn to music, or audio,<br>others will be called by virtual worlds, or visual.</p>
  <p>Ordinarily, that means starting with lmms, or blender,<br>and that is always neat for a little while.</p>
  <p>But there comes a point where you discover,<br>that you compose music by means of an algorithm that you enjoy.</p>
  <p>There comes a point where you discover,<br>that you model 3D objects by following the same pattern, or algorithm.</p>
  <p>And then you ask yourself why should I do all this clicking,<br>over an over, repeating the same pattern?</p>

  <p>The audio does split into more than just music,<br>but for a moment, consider what you have here.</p>
  <p>You have endless songs,<br>that play forever.</p>
  <p>That are under the control of a programming language,<br>a programming language is the real user interface of a computer.</p>
  <p>School has been lying to you,<br>it is a terrible idea to learn how to use Excel, it is a silly program.</p>
  <p>When it comes to using a computer the first and foremost,<br>is learning a high level programming language, so that you can automate things.</p>
  <p>The music teacher has lied to you,<br>you are not supposed to read notes, you are not the machine.</p>
  <p>You are the composer,<br>more than that the year is 2021 now.</p>
  <p>We got to get on with the times,<br>that means <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jfoLxQXq3Y">pulse trains</a>.</p>
  <p>Music class,<br>is not even in the right time period.</p>
  <p>The amount of code required to compose the back beat,<br>is file and rate, two things.</p>
  <p>You don't need to bother with remembering that the train rate is in hertz,<br>just that the higher the number the faster it goes.</p>
  <p>The numbers are between 1 and 8 maybe,<br>that's part of the real computer the interface.</p>
  <p>Real and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1m0aX9Lpts">effective music composition that you can take to a night club is about a full orchestra</a>,<br>either you have a band or a computer.</p>
  <p><a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/">It takes very little to put a computer band together</a>,<br><a href="https://youtu.be/eAlsGJnLVuE?t=189">behold the power of the sequence node</a>.</p>

  <p>A proper music tutorial takes two days,<br>learning programming in the p5 editor, or even atom and elementary same if not less.</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/nick-thompson/elementary/tree/master/examples">You have to use the examples, use the boilerplate, if you choose elementary</a><br>don't try to learn programming from the beginning, learn by modifying the boilerplate.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0tZHxAVtD4">Setting up on something like bandcamp is free, becoming an indie artist is priceless</a>,<br>you can have your first song ready in 7 days, and your first experimental album out in a month,</p>
  <p>But being able to algorithmically get started with fresh albums,<br>is an amazing way to compose super-fresh and energy packed workout and jogging music.</p>
  <p>No matter how good the song is, it lasts about a workout and a half,<br>if you can consistently deliver fresh material without stressing about it, you got yourself a business going.</p>
  <p>Put the money together and build a school,<br>invest in the labels that your students will create, for a very small percent and put a school on every continent.</p>

  <p>If you are a visual artist,<br>then know that you are not just creating for the computer.</p>
  <p>Let us leap into practical applications,<br>and skip over the programming part that I described in the music section.</p>
  <p>Let me ask you, how long will it take you to algorithmically create a concrete apartment building,<br>say one tenth of the scale as part of an art installation.</p>
  <p>Once you feel comfy with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEMNv4mze3Q">boolean modifiers</a><br>all you need to do is model some rooms and generate some staircases.</p>
  <p>How long would it take to create factory of unseen artworks,<br>based on interpreting a small part of a random photo, into an alien landscape or even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-woNweDecM">flotilla of star ships</a>.</p>
  <p>How long for a bat-belt, buckle links, and pockets,<br>and here you can define everything by variable, and randomize the design motif.</p>
  <p>And now think about wallets,<br>how long would it take you to generate few thousand somewhat unique wallet designs, or kits for 3D printing.</p>

  <p>Programmatic or Generative Design, inherits your creativity,<br>it is not machine like.</p>
  <p>And it is not as automated as it seems,<br>the more generations you create, the greater the challenge.</p>
  <p>The greater your quest for originality,<br>and the clearer and more powerful, and more plentiful your algorithms.</p>

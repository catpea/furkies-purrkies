that the year is 2021 now.\nWe got to get on with the times,\nthat means pulse trains[5].\nMusic class,\nis not even in the right time period.\nThe amount of code required to compose the back beat,\nis file and rate, two things.\nYou don't need to bother with remembering that the train rate is in hertz,\njust that the higher the number the faster it goes.\nThe numbers are between 1 and 8 maybe,\nthat's part of the real computer the interface.\nReal and effective music composition that you can take to a night club is about a full orchestra[6],\neither you have a band or a computer.\nIt takes very little to put a computer band together[7],\nbehold the power of the sequence node[8].\n\nA proper music tutorial takes two days,\nlearning programming in the p5 editor, or even atom and elementary same if not less.\nYou have to use the examples, use the boilerplate, if you choose elementary[9]\ndon't try to learn programming from the beginning, learn by modifying the boilerplate.\nSetting up on something like bandcamp is free, becoming an indie artist is priceless[10],\nyou can have your first song ready in 7 days, and your first experimental album out in a month,\nBut being able to algorithmically get started with fresh albums,\nis an amazing way to compose super-fresh and energy packed workout and jogging music.\nNo matter how good the song is, it lasts about a workout and a half,\nif you can consistently deliver fresh material without stressing about it, you got yourself a business going.\nPut the money together and build a school,\ninvest in the labels that your students will create, for a very small percent and put a school on every continent.\n\nIf you are a visual artist,\nthen know that you are not just creating for the computer.\nLet us leap into practical applications,\nand skip over the programming part that I described in the music section.\nLet me ask you, how long will it take you to algorithmically create a concrete apartment building,\nsay one tenth of the scale as part of an art installation.\nOnce you feel comfy with boolean modifiers[11]\nall you need to do is model some rooms and generate some staircases.\nHow long would it take to create factory of unseen artworks,\nbased on interpreting a small part of a random photo, into an alien landscape or even a flotilla of star ships[12].\nHow long for a bat-belt, buckle links, and pockets,\nand here you can define everything by variable, and randomize the design motif.\nAnd now think about wallets,\nhow long would it take you to generate few thousand somewhat unique wallet designs, or kits for 3D printing.\n\nProgrammatic or Generative Design, inherits your creativity,\nit is not machine like.\nAnd it is not as automated as it seems,\nthe more generations you create, the greater the challenge.\nThe greater your quest for originality,\nand the clearer and more powerful, and more plentiful your algorithms.\n \nReferences\n[1]:

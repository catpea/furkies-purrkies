Drawing is not something you try to learn,
drawing comes automatically as you work on your comics.

It won't take very long before you are doing free hand panels,
but don't start with drawing.

Because art, will only give you what you want,
if you give it something it wants.

Art wants creation, longs stories, lovely stories,
but above all art want you to enjoy yourself without making sacrifices.

You can't just sit home all the time, practicing how to draw,
you have to live a beautiful life too.

To give art something to begin with,
you will need to make a trip to the pet store.

The reason we pick the pet store,
because the toys there are not treated very well.

They get torn up and eaten,
so you save a couple.

Once you have your dolls,
get a camera with a tripod.

Give them a nice bright background,
and light up the scene so that it looks sharp in a photo.

Take a long time to do your photo shoot,
pose the dolls together, use sticky tape, use a wire.

Once you have 20 to 50 nice an interesting photos,
get them on the computer and project them on a canvas with a digital projector.

---

Go big,
a single panel in a comic book should the the size of a painting.

In fact it may become a painting,
it may sell for more than a painting.

You may end up getting into a gallery or hanging up your works at a coffee shop,
and then selling your comics there.

And trace, when making cartoons the outlines should very tick,
almost twice as thick as the inner lines.

There is a magical trick you can do here,
if you choose not to paint eyes, but this is somewhat advanced.

If you take the time to create a library of eyes,
then you can stick them using magnets on the canvas, this will change the mood of your scenes.

But don't worry about that at first,
leave this idea for later.

---

Once you have a few photos painted on paper with acrylic paint,
and outlined with acrylic markers.

You go into a second photo shoot,
but here you take pictures of your paintings, not the dolls.

Imperfections and textures,
give art a soul.

Each and every one of your scenes will come to life,
as you arrange them.

---

As you have guessed by now,
the sequence in which your story is told is second to your art.

It is a little bit like shooting a movie first,
and then having the movie editor create an interesting story out of it.

It is a little backwards,
but each and everyone of your panes will be a work of art.

All you have to do now is add some speech bubbles,
and text on the computer.

If you feel that you are missing a scene,
just draw it on paper to make a note, and have another photo shoot with the dolls later on.

---

Of course,
you don't have to use dolls.

But if you use a real kitty cat,
you will get scratched.

And if you have your friends model for you,
you will have to pay them.

---

If you want something silly and personal,
take closeup photos.

If you want an epic comic, you almost don't need models,
as your photos would have to capture an enormous background.

In epic photography, a model can be just one-tenth of the scene,
but you will of course still need closeups for dialogues.

---

First you take photographs of your models,
then you paint them on canvas with the aid of an art projector.

And then you take photos of the canvas,
this is the process of digitizing your artwork, adding text, publishing be it web or paper.

You can upload it to the internet as a web comic,
or start putting together an entire comic book.

---

Give art your love of creating things,
and art will give you the inspiration, practice, talent and skill to finish all your works.

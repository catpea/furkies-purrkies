  <p>Drawing is not something you try to learn,<br>drawing comes automatically as you work on your comics.</p>
  <p>It won't take very long before you are doing free hand panels,<br>but don't start with drawing.</p>
  <p>Because art, will only give you what you want,<br>if you give it something it wants.</p>
  <p>Art wants creation, longs stories, lovely stories,<br>but above all art want you to enjoy yourself without making sacrifices.</p>
  <p>You can't just sit home all the time, practicing how to draw,<br>you have to live a beautiful life too.</p>

  <p>To give art something to begin with,<br>you will need to make a trip to the pet store.</p>
  <p>The reason we pick the pet store,<br>because the toys there are not treated very well.</p>
  <p>They get torn up and eaten,<br>so you save a couple.</p>

  <p>Once you have your dolls,<br>get a camera with a tripod.</p>
  <p>Give them a nice bright background,<br>and light up the scene so that it looks sharp in a photo.</p>
  <p>Take a long time to do your photo shoot,<br>pose the dolls together, use sticky tape, use a wire.</p>
  <p>Once you have 20 to 50 nice an interesting photos,<br>get them on the computer and project them on a canvas with a digital projector.</p>

  <p>Go big,<br>a single panel in a comic book should the the size of a painting.</p>
  <p>In fact it may become a painting,<br>it may sell for more than a painting.</p>
  <p>You may end up getting into a gallery or hanging up your works at a coffee shop,<br>and then selling your comics there.</p>

  <p>And trace, when making cartoons the outlines should very tick,<br>almost twice as thick as the inner lines.</p>
  <p>There is a magical trick you can do here,<br>if you choose not to paint eyes, but this is somewhat advanced.</p>
  <p>If you take the time to create a library of eyes,<br>then you can stick them using magnets on the canvas, this will change the mood of your scenes.</p>
  <p>But don't worry about that at first,<br>leave this idea for later.</p>

  <p>Once you have a few photos painted on paper with acrylic paint,<br>and outlined with acrylic markers.</p>
  <p>You go into a second photo shoot,<br>but here you take pictures of your paintings, not the dolls.</p>
  <p>Imperfections and textures,<br>give art a soul.</p>
  <p>Each and every one of your scenes will come to life,<br>as you arrange them.</p>

  <p>As you have guessed by now,<br>the sequence in which your story is told is second to your art.</p>
  <p>It is a little bit like shooting a movie first,<br>and then having the movie editor create an interesting story out of it.</p>
  <p>It is a little backwards,<br>but each and everyone of your panes will be a work of art.</p>
  <p>All you have to do now is add some speech bubbles,<br>and text on the computer.</p>
  <p>If you feel that you are missing a scene,<br>just draw it on paper to make a note, and have another photo shoot with the dolls later on.</p>

  <p>Of course,<br>you don't have to use dolls.</p>

  <p>If you want something silly and personal,<br>take closeup photos.</p>
  <p>If you want an epic comic, you almost don't need models,<br>as your photos would have to capture an enormous background.</p>
  <p>In epic photography, a model can be just one-tenth of the scene,<br>but you will of course still need closeups for dialogues.</p>

  <p>First you take photographs of your models,<br>then you paint them on canvas with the aid of an art projector.</p>
  <p>And then you take photos of the canvas,<br>this is the process of digitizing your artwork, adding text, publishing be it web or paper.</p>
  <p>You can upload it to the internet as a web comic,<br>or start putting together an entire comic book.</p>

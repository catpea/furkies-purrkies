    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There actually is,<br>a good use for drawing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZlqtNmMICQ">simplified models</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Where you draw a face model on your source image,<br>mark all the distances, and make all the relative measurements.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then repaint the super-simplified model again,<br>but this time on your empty canvas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This technique also works for the body,<br>there you will mark knees and joints and shoulders.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And again repaint the model you drew over the photo,<br>on a blank canvas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If all you have is a photo,<br>canvas and traditional brushes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Turn your photo into a line-reference model,<br>and draw the same geometric contraption on your canvas to get started.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I would like them to use their good judgment on a silly and fascinating warp transform,<br>and then use that as use direct reference.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Slightly warped or not, I would like to see my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnd4CtXmQTE">real face</a> not something that is a try,<br>I want them to get it right, and have fun while painting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And why would I want them to draw little line models, first,<br>that will only cause unnecessary distortion.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We can't forget that a proper or perfect likeness,<br>is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d58P2hSxbEk">small potato</a> in relation to all the other things that should be going on in the painting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">An artist may already begin by taking over the eyes,<br>and making them glow.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then move on to a Suit of Armor,<br>and weapons, a battle, a star ship, mars, wings, something... something interesting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though I am not sure if I would ever request a portrait,<br>I like things that I create on my own.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But I think I am a fan of big scenes,<br>and painting those has also benefited from modern technologies.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xAumJRKV6A">3D Modeling</a>,<br>is a wonderful way to map out a complex scene.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I would really enjoy building a world,<br>with architecture and characters, maybe a fancy monster, or a dragon, up close.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">All the while tracking the one angle,<br>that I would paint this world from.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A 3D printed world is a neat companion for a painting,<br>that displays all the action and emotion.</div>

  <p>There actually is,<br>a good use for drawing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZlqtNmMICQ">simplified models</a>.</p>
  <p>Where you draw a face model on your source image,<br>mark all the distances, and make all the relative measurements.</p>
  <p>And then repaint the super-simplified model again,<br>but this time on your empty canvas.</p>
  <p>This technique also works for the body,<br>there you will mark knees and joints and shoulders.</p>
  <p>And again repaint the model you drew over the photo,<br>on a blank canvas.</p>
  <p>If all you have is a photo,<br>canvas and traditional brushes.</p>
  <p>Turn your photo into a line-reference model,<br>and draw the same geometric contraption on your canvas to get started.</p>

  <p>If I ever had a portrait pained of me,<br>I would ask the artist not to do that.</p>
  <p>I would like them to use their good judgment on a silly and fascinating warp transform,<br>and then use that as use direct reference.</p>
  <p>Slightly warped or not, I would like to see my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnd4CtXmQTE">real face</a> not something that is a try,<br>I want them to get it right, and have fun while painting.</p>
  <p>And why would I want them to draw little line models, first,<br>that will only cause unnecessary distortion.</p>

  <p>We can't forget that a proper or perfect likeness,<br>is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d58P2hSxbEk">small potato</a> in relation to all the other things that should be going on in the painting.</p>
  <p>An artist may already begin by taking over the eyes,<br>and making them glow.</p>
  <p>Then move on to a Suit of Armor,<br>and weapons, a battle, a star ship, mars, wings, something... something interesting.</p>
  <p>Though I am not sure if I would ever request a portrait,<br>I like things that I create on my own.</p>

  <p>Portraits are special because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_with_an_Ermine">Lady with an Ermine</a>,<br>was the first work of art that I understood as such, wham I was little.</p>
  <p>But I think I am a fan of big scenes,<br>and painting those has also benefited from modern technologies.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xAumJRKV6A">3D Modeling</a>,<br>is a wonderful way to map out a complex scene.</p>
  <p>I would really enjoy building a world,<br>with architecture and characters, maybe a fancy monster, or a dragon, up close.</p>
  <p>All the while tracking the one angle,<br>that I would paint this world from.</p>
  <p>A 3D printed world is a neat companion for a painting,<br>that displays all the action and emotion.</p>

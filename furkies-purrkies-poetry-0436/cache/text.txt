To make our way towards World Peace,
we will need to accept that frequently both enemies are wrong.

Moreover, once the conflict begins,
they enter a state that is void.

A path of no return,
a world of war.

But we are not helpless against it,
there is something that can be done.

It is a noble act,
more powerful than the miserable void it self.

The act,
of prevention.

Preventing the wars,
from taking place.

By lifting the world with Real Education,
that leads to real knowledge, that leads to wisdom.

Permanent World Peace is within reach,
and the first step is fixing Education.

The culture of World Peace,
begins in school.

We need to induce,
four changes.

1. Education must become Personalized,
it cannot be standardized.

2. Students must be prevented from memorizing,
and given tools necessary for understanding, such as life changing Scientific and Philosophical Games.

3. We need student exchange programs across the entire world,
a student can choose to travel for a week, for a month, or for an entire semester; and the subject of study here, is the culture it self, there are no grades, no classes.

4. Education must be recognized as a kind of work,
and pay a middle-class level salary, in great part as an investment into the future of Human Kind.

One of the biggest changes brought on by this wiser path towards the future,
will be Universal Income, not just basic income, Universal Income.

There is nothing to explain here,
our generations have already proven, that we are not wise enough to grasp the importance of this transformation.

The world of the future,
will be different from the world that we know today.

It will not be our world,
it will be the Peaceful World of the children that we helped, to grow in Knowledge and Wisdom.

  <p>Once, late at night,</p>
  <p>I was prancing in the moonlight.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Marching through the woodlands of Ludington State Park,</p>
  <p>and I must say, even with the moonlight the woods remained dark.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There was an occasional bark or a howl,</p>
  <p>but it didn&apos;t get scary till I heard an owl.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she said,</p>
  <p>&quot;I am about to swoop down and peck y&apos;all dead.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;No, thank you Dear Madam&quot;, I sweetly replied,</p>
  <p>as I hastened my step and lengthened my stride.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - I heard,</p>
  <p>to which I yelled now at a gallop &quot;I ain&apos;t afraid of no bird.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;Hoot, hoot&quot; - she added, and now I was running forward with all the pep,</p>
  <p>squirting urine at every step.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And finally we jumped out into a moonlit clearing,</p>
  <p>and she made a 180, perched upon a tree leering.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I was lucky, and my camp was near,</p>
  <p>legend has it that she&apos;s still out there filling the woods with fear.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So if if you&apos;re ever out there, and hear a hoot,</p>
  <p>better grab onto your butt, and scoot.</p>

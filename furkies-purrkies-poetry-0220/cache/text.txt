Once, late at night,
I was prancing in the moonlight.
Marching through the woodlands of Ludington State Park,
and I must say, even with the moonlight the woods remained dark.

There was an occasional bark or a howl,
but it didn't get scary till I heard an owl.
"Hoot, hoot" - she said,
"I am about to swoop down and peck y'all dead."

"No, thank you Dear Madam", I sweetly replied,
as I hastened my step and lengthened my stride.
"Hoot, hoot" - I heard,
to which I yelled now at a gallop "I ain't afraid of no bird."

"Hoot, hoot" - she added, and now I was running forward with all the pep,
squirting urine at every step.
And finally we jumped out into a moonlit clearing,
and she made a 180, perched upon a tree leering.

I was lucky, and my camp was near,
legend has it that she's still out there filling the woods with fear.
So if if you're ever out there, and hear a hoot,
better grab onto your butt, and scoot.

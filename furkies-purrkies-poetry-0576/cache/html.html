  <p>Do not overestimate the length of the road you must travel,<br>to reach the point where you are comfortable with how much you have learned.</p>
  <p>We are magnificent beings,<br>and the wisdom does not come from knowledge alone.</p>
  <p>You will reach tipping point between knowledge and wisdom,<br>not with knowledge alone, but with the great multiplier of subtle analogies.</p>
  <p>Wisdom,<br>is near.</p>

  <p>Before I describe the structure of the new schools, and go over some of the problems,<br>I must issue a warning.</p>
  <p>Being able to read books, is the most important lesson that early schools must teach,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnSiL7gCs4A">growing up without the ability to read is crushing, and it is torture</a>.</p>
  <p>I encourage all the students in the world to help each other,<br>and search for those who are hiding that they can’t read.</p>
  <p>First bring them Narrated Books, create a fund to help them with money,<br>and then bring them to class.</p>
  <p>One of the greatest Honors and Responsibilities that a student can have,<br>is making sure that everyone is able to read and has free access to narrated books.</p>
  <p>Help the world to books,<br>and guard and protect real education.</p>

  <p>Now, to fix education, we begin by setting all the subject divisions aside,<br>and building what can be thought of as the new tree of knowledge.</p>
  <p>The root of the tree of knowledge honors the littlest ones,<br>who honorably never stop asking why.</p>
  <p>We begin at the birth of the universe,<br>the leading theory of the big bang.</p>
  <p>From there we will talk about the universe,<br>the third generation star, her accretion disk, and the coalescing of earth.</p>
  <p>This is not a lesson in astrophysics,<br>this is a lesson in when and where we are.</p>
  <p>Once we get to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-G7IJCkyvg">Stromatolites</a>,<br>we will start the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtNs5k2KHXU">countdown</a> towards the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkX-hLiU_r8">Modern Human</a>.</p>
  <p>[And only once we get to Mesopotamia, will we talk about mathematics][mesopotamia],<br>and math will be introduced along the line of time, from ancient times to Sir Newton and beyond.</p>

  <p>This is a survey course,<br>the initial time based layout of all the Knowledge that humanity has acquired, is just an introduction.</p>
  <p>But the tree is not to be covered in any standardized way,<br>the students are introduced to moving along the line of time, but are expected to break away and visit branches of the tree that interest them.</p>
  <p>Music and Dance, Art, Computer Programming, Design, are examples of branches that the students may hop to.</p>
  <p>They aren’t quite skipping math, they are just going to be introduced to mathematics that is flavored by their curiosity.</p>
  <p>Programmatic Music Composition is an introduction to math, Generative Art and Programming is an introduction to math, Programmatic 3D modeling is an introduction to math.</p>

  <p>The children will access - the once cut up subjects - within the context of their curiosities,<br>the teachers will be able to see where the children are in the tree, and introduce them to groups with similar curiosity.</p>
  <p>No one should be introduced to any subject directly,<br>no human can learn that way.</p>
  <p>Direct introduction is fraud,<br>it is how knowledge is stolen from students.</p>
  <p>Cutting up subjects and poisoning them with abstraction and timed divisions,<br>is how students are sold for paychecks and tricked into memorization.</p>
  <p>This will neither be forgiven,<br>nor forgotten - it must end now.</p>

  <p>Real education requires time and unbroken connections,<br>don’t let anybody push you into a cutup set of nothing as that is fools gold.</p>
  <p>One horrible thing that we are faced with in life,<br>is people actually pushing us to cut everything up into nothing.</p>
  <p>Go to fake school, take a lesson, take another lesson,<br>graduate and get a job.</p>
  <p>That is how fake education spreads,<br>that is not how real education works.</p>
  <p>We can’t just butter a bunch of toast and eat it,<br>we have to build cathedrals.</p>
  <p>The breathtaking thing about cathedrals,<br>is that they take multiple epochs to finish.</p>
  <p>What you start as a child,<br>will be completed by The Noble Adult, that you will later become.</p>

  <p>You are a Noble and Majestic being,<br>and all the tools of Genius are yours, and most are within you already.</p>
  <p>No child should face the corridors of a school,<br>that sells them out for a small paycheck.</p>
  <p>They should face nothing less,<br>than the endless magnificent maze of a memory cathedrals as unique as their mind is beautiful.</p>
  <p>Real education is a unique path thorough a constellation of subjects,<br>that will only match the student traveling it.</p>
  <p>They will adapt course to meet with any new curiosities,<br>to adapt to new contexts.</p>
  <p>The future generations are looking at us,<br>and it is not looking good.</p>
  <p>All those arguments that teachers make, are null and void,<br>because the first and foremost is the student success in the life after school.</p>
  <p>Fake education must end,<br>the pandemics are already challenging us, climate change will soon do the same.</p>
  <p>Reject fake education,<br>reject memorization.</p>
  <p>Travel your constellations in search of real education,<br>build your cathedrals of knowledge, build the future.</p>

We are granted Consciousness,
but given no guarantees by the Universe.

The only guarantee we have is Ourselves,
the one Element that we are truly in control of.

The deliberate act of Growing Up,
is a constant reminder of that control.

Dusk and Twilight, Tears in the Rain, and Aches in Every Muscle,
surrounded by Unfairness, Blindness, Ends Everywhere, and yet we Rise.

Though it may be the very end of some world,
we are never robbed of the choice to keep going forward.

The choice to exert control over the walls that the Universe has us up against,
when all else has gone dark, the choice always remains.

And when we can no longer change the World,
then we have to grow up to gain new powers that fit that world better.

The new powers will, alter the world,
and eventually we will find our way back home.

No matter what misery or battles mark our past,
having chosen to Rise, and Learn, and Rebuild; made us Beautiful.

No matter what challenges lie ahead,
The Great Act of Growing Up, is an Inexhaustible Source of Unlimited Wisdom.

And the sum of it all,
is the Great Health and Joy of Life.

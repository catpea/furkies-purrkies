  <p>It turned out that the printer required for printing wax,<br>that then can be surrounded by a casting medium (plaster)...</p>
  <p>Fired in an oven to remove wax,<br>and filled with molten metal such as Pewter or Silver, or even Gold.</p>
  <p>Costs a bit less than a regular 3D printer,<br>such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gokN9xNG94U">Ender 3 v2</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN5n7Dy0quk">which you should always get with a Bed Leveling Kit</a>)</p>
  <p>The wax printer costs about $200 dollars,<br>and is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgFU6SueFO8">Mars Elegoo</a></p>
  <p>This is a resin printer, breathing resin is dangerous,<br>so you will need ventilation and a mask that can stop the toxic particles.</p>

  <p>Melting metal is dangerous,<br>when molten metal traps moisture.</p>
  <p>The moisture will convert to steam,<br>and that means it will rapidly expand.</p>
  <p>Guess how many times,<br>1,700, and I have a vague recollection of someone saying over 2,000.</p>
  <p>So molten metal then pops,<br>and scatters all over the area.</p>
  <p>I repeat melting metal is dangerous,<br>I will not do it.</p>

  <p>But and above all,<br>having a wax part, is a amazing.</p>
  <p>Because you should be able to find a place,<br>that will cast it for you.</p>
  <p>And to return to the dangerous side of things,<br>a metal called Pewter which used to be used for spoons in the Colonial era.</p>
  <p>Actually to this day you can metal detect spoon bowls,<br>the handles usually snap off as pewter is not as strong as other metals.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqy_cCgU4Dg">Pewter is special because it does not require high heat</a>,<br>in fact it can be melted in a solder hot plate.</p>
  <p>Be aware that Pewter from an unknown source may contain lead,<br>and led is a deadly neurotoxin.</p>
  <p>So if you are going to melt pewter,<br>make sure that it is from a reliable source and certified not to have lead it.</p>
  <p>But please be safe, gloves, ventilation,<br>and and a face shield are a must.</p>
  <p>Again, personally I will never take the risk,<br>Huge Pussies live long for just that reason.</p>

  <p>Now, there is something that isnâ€™t dangerous,<br>that is really cool, and fun and fancy.</p>
  <p>And that is using a standard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64KBsX42yG0">PLA plastic</a> printer,<br>with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=GOLD+PLA+Review">shiny, silky metallic-looking plastic</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=smoothing+PLA&sp=CAM%253D">To get it even more shiny, you can try a vapor smoothing treatment</a>,<br>which does require ventilation, but is not as dangerous as metal.</p>

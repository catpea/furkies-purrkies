    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Costs a bit less than a regular 3D printer,<br>such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gokN9xNG94U">Ender 3 v2</a> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN5n7Dy0quk">which you should always get with a Bed Leveling Kit</a>)</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is a resin printer, breathing resin is dangerous,<br>so you will need ventilation and a mask that can stop the toxic particles.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Melting metal is dangerous,<br>when molten metal traps moisture.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The moisture will convert to steam,<br>and that means it will rapidly expand.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Guess how many times,<br>1,700, and I have a vague recollection of someone saying over 2,000.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So molten metal then pops,<br>and scatters all over the area.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because you should be able to find a place,<br>that will cast it for you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And to return to the dangerous side of things,<br>a metal called Pewter which used to be used for spoons in the Colonial era.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Actually to this day you can metal detect spoon bowls,<br>the handles usually snap off as pewter is not as strong as other metals.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqy_cCgU4Dg">Pewter is special because it does not require high heat</a>,<br>in fact it can be melted in a solder hot plate.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Be aware that Pewter from an unknown source may contain lead,<br>and led is a deadly neurotoxin.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So if you are going to melt pewter,<br>make sure that it is from a reliable source and certified not to have lead it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But please be safe, gloves, ventilation,<br>and and a face shield are a must.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Again, personally I will never take the risk,<br>Huge Pussies live long for just that reason.</div>

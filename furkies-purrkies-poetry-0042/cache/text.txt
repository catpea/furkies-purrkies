Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Seven.
I can't believe that seven only rhymes with Eleven, and Heaven.

Every ten days I get stuck rhyming those two words,
and it is just about as fun as petting birds.

I was writing Bash this afternoon,
I am so full of energy, I feel like a loon.

I was so tired at eight yesterday,
I have no idea how I will fall asleep today.

I wrote a non-capturing Perl Regular Expression in sed,
gosh I miss the old Perl, I miss CGI, and I miss ed.

What has the world become after abandoning modes,
and how strange have become our codes.

Using SASS writ in C++,
to make CSS? What a mess!

And beyond that, with async/await,
JavaScript has become a heavy weight.

I always tell people if you make for the web,
use the language, of the web.

They then look at me accusingly,
parading Python, PHP or Dart, maybe Java?! amusingly.

Come on people, this is not our first rodeo,
Time took out Perl with a torpedo.

This is war, and those who fall behind lose,
If you write for the web, use the language, of the web.

Your utilities will hang around longer,
and your accomplishments will be that much stronger.

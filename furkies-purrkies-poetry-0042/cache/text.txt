Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Seven.
I can't believe that seven only rhymes with Eleven, and Heaven.
Every ten days I get stuck rhyming those two words,
and it is just about as fun as petting birds.
I was writing Bash[1] this afternoon,
I am so full of energy, I feel like a loon.
I was so tired at eight yesterday,
I have no idea how I will fall asleep today.
I wrote a non-capturing[2] Perl Regular Expression[3] in sed[4],
gosh I miss the old Perl[5], I miss CGI[6], and I miss ed[7].
What has the world become after abandoning modes[8],
and how strange have become our codes.
Using SASS[9] writ in C++[10],
to make CSS[11]? What a mess!
And beyond that, with async/await[12],
JavaScript[13] has become a heavy weight.
I always tell people if you make for the web,
use the language, of the web[14].
They then look at me accusingly,
parading Python[15], PHP[16] or Dart[17], maybe Java[18]?! amusingly.
Come on people, this is not our first rodeo,
Time took out Perl with a torpedo.
This is war, and those who fall behind lose,
If you write for the web, use the language, of the web[19].
Your utilities will hang around longer,
and your accomplishments will be that much stronger.

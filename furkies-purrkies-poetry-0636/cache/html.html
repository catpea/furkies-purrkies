  <p>We walk away from a school class with a test,<br>but learning for real is best.</p>

  <p>You shouldn't aim to compose entire songs,<br>learn about drums and where the back-beat belongs.</p>
  <p>You don't need to know how physics works for circuit design,<br>using a program to design your circuit and measure your voltages is fine.</p>
  <p>The need to sketch freehand to become an artist is dumb,<br>use a projector and keep having fun.</p>

  <p>Yes, you will not become a master of all while learning bit by bit,<br>but with each step you will enhance your mental toolkit.</p>
  <p>Just because you know only a little about music composition,<br>and can't compose like a wold famous musician...</p>
  <p>Does not make you worse,<br>not knowing the whole thing is not a curse.</p>
  <p>It is one of the things that make you beautiful,<br>it simply means you are expanding your mind tool by tool.</p>

  <p>When those who crammed for tests say you are Jack of all trades, and a master of none,<br>just tell them at least you are having fun.</p>
  <p>But the truth of the matter is that you are learning for real,<br>and they frequently pretend to be a big deal.</p>
  <p>The only way to learn for real is bit by bit,<br>and that's the only way anybody can make it.</p>
  <p>Merely passing tests makes a student hollow,<br>but learning for real makes a know it all.</p>

  <p>That our curiosities branch in a few hundred directions,<br>means that we can make beautiful connections.</p>
  <p>Being a master of none while learning for real,<br>makes you beautiful, it <strong>is</strong> a big deal.</p>
  <p>Believe me when I say,<br>that all your unfinished works are precious as they show your way.</p>
  <p>They tell a history of who you are,<br>they show the path you took to become a star.</p>

  <p>Drums have begun calling to me,<br>as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwWmcMz0ZVk">I danced to a Scottish song for everyone to see</a>.</p>
  <p>My dancing and curiosity about music are are merging,<br>and soon something new will be emerging.</p>
  <p>I am already learning to give my drums an upgrade,<br>let me show you an incomplete song I just made.</p>
  <p>I don't know how to fix it yet,<br>but I know once I discover it, I will never forget.</p>
  <p>All my dance songs have thus far been incomplete this way,<br>but I'll learn how to do it right, someday.</p>
  <p>Just because I am not a master,<br>does not mean this is a disaster.</p>
  <p>I am just learning for real,<br>and I know that eventually all my songs will have great appeal.</p>

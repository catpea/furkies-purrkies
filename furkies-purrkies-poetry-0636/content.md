Learning is an art,
so as long as we learn bit by bit we will become smart.

---

In schools teachers threaten to memorize,
but you should always aim to become wise.

You need to understand,
because you get nothing if you just perform and pretend.

---

You don't have to learn huge lessons just a tiny bit,
you should aim just to sharpen your wit.

---

We walk away from a school class with a test,
but learning for real is best.

We won't always understand everything at once,
because we have to give ourselves a chance.

---

You shouldn't aim to compose entire songs,
learn about drums and where the back-beat belongs.

You don't need to know how physics works for circuit design,
using a program to design your circuit and measure your voltages is fine.

The need to sketch freehand to become an artist is dumb,
use a projector and keep having fun.

---

Yes, you will not become a master of all while learning bit by bit,
but with each step you will enhance your mental toolkit.

Just because you know only a little about music composition,
and can't compose like a wold famous musician...

Does not make you worse,
not knowing the whole thing is not a curse.

It is one of the things that make you beautiful,
it simply means you are expanding your mind tool by tool.

---

When those who crammed for tests say you are Jack of all trades, and a master of none,
just tell them at least you are having fun.

But the truth of the matter is that you are learning for real,
and they frequently pretend to be a big deal.

The only way to learn for real is bit by bit,
and that's the only way anybody can make it.

Merely passing tests makes a student hollow,
but learning for real makes a know it all.

---

That our curiosities branch in a few hundred directions,
means that we can make beautiful connections.

Being a master of none while learning for real,
makes you beautiful, it __is__ a big deal.

Believe me when I say,
that all your unfinished works are precious as they show your way.

They tell a history of who you are,
they show the path you took to become a star.

For example,

---

Drums have begun calling to me,
as [I danced to a Scottish song for everyone to see][1].

My dancing and curiosity about music are are merging,
and soon something new will be emerging.

I am already learning to give my drums an upgrade,
let me show you an incomplete song I just made.

I don't know how to fix it yet,
but I know once I discover it, I will never forget.

All my dance songs have thus far been incomplete this way,
but I'll learn how to do it right, someday.

Just because I am not a master,
does not mean this is a disaster.

I am just learning for real,
and I know that eventually all my songs will have great appeal.

---

Take good care of your curiosities,
as they can only enhance your knowledge and qualities.

And love the wisdom you find along the way,
as it will never lead you astray.

[Here is my strange incomplete classical dance song][2],
I hope it is not too long.

  <p>You don’t start from scratch,<br>you start by making a circle the size of the ring.</p>
  <p>And that becomes the foundation,<br>on top of which you attach all the decorations.</p>
  <p>It is like a rail,<br>onto which you slide ring bits.</p>

  <p>The way you start programming,<br>on top of a circle in Blender.</p>
  <p>Is by applying a modifier to your shape,<br>modifiers are very commonly used for many things.</p>
  <p>I always use the Boolean Modifier,<br>to create hard surface objects like wallets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>But the Geometry Nodes Modifier is special,<br>it is like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ1X0ADyONE">blank modifier that is yet to be programmed</a>.</p>
  <p>And in order to accomplish this,<br>it has a unique visual programming language.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Geometry+Nodes+Modifier">Watch several random tutorials on any Geometry Nodes topic</a><br>and take plenty of notes, it gets easier after a bit.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>The input the blank modifier receives,<br>is the geometry of the simple ring circle, or any object.</p>
  <p>It is those X,Y,Z coordinates that will flow through your program,<br>under the control of the visual programming nodes designed to control them.</p>
  <p>You may subdivide shapes,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai3FLHS7c2k">or apply other shapes on top of them relative to their length</a>.</p>

  <p>As to classical jewelry, know that a diamond or a stone,<br>is cut to a standard shape so that it can fit a standard seat.</p>
  <p>You should replicate the shape of whatever you will set,<br>as use it as a model, to create the seat.</p>
  <p>The seats that hold the stones, will need a rail,<br>to create a strong structure that wont bend or break.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>So when <a href="https://youtu.be/CWoCd-WhIsw?t=31">making a basic ring</a>,<br>you have to focus on the rock seats, and the rails that make the ring sturdy.</p>
  <p>This is what you wrap around your basic ring shape,<br>the seats and rails.</p>
  <p>Now this describes just one kind of ring,<br>and you should use more than a circle, put an arc on top of the ring for one.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Just to summarize, you start with a simplified shape, just a circle,<br>and then you apply components of the ring around it.</p>
  <p>If all you have is a plastic 3D printer,<br>scale up your creating a bit and print out larger prototypes.</p>
  <p>But, once you make your first jewelry piece,<br>you’ll know exactly where to go next.</p>

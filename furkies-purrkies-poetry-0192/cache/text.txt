So as long as you fully accept the fact,
that a key to every Success in Life is, Happiness.

And so as long, as you take the time to help others,
to accept this Grand Fact of Life as well.

So as long as you take the time to congratulate,
those who tried to move an audience, but did not speak enough.

And so as long, as you say to them,
"Next time you try to save the world, I hope you invite me to come along."
so that they know they can't lose a battle, if it is all for good.

So as long, as you are a constant reminder,
that none should overwork, or go through life tired.

And so as long as you encourage others,
to set fair aims in life so that they won't push themselves too hard.

So as long, a you take time to read wise and inspiring books,
understanding that there is no Education, without Self Education.

And so as long you nobly fuel the curiosity of others,
and help them find their own beloved books, as well.

So as long as you help Students remember,
that grades are not a judgment on them,
but the school and teacher's work.

And so as long as you remind them,
that they are a Genius and a Sweetheart too.

So as long as you take the time of day,
to help people feel a bit more cheerful and better.

And so as long as your sweetness,
inspires them to do the same.

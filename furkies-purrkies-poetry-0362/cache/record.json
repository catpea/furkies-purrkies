<div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">you can see patches of well worn exposed dirt where hikers or hunters camp, they are all very nice.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div

for some reason,</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza

</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">When I

</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">There

became even more beautiful.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text

class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">And looking towards Lake Michigan you kind of see the lake in a new light as well,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">it looks, well, more beautiful from that height as you get to see more waves, and what seems like a more distant horizon.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section

avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But I took the well manicured left turn keeping on West Forest Trail Rd,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and took it all the way until the end passing hundreds of happy campers and fancy sites.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I parked at the loop where the road ended, paid a few dollars for few days of parking my car,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and set off for the Nordhouse Wildernes.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I made it up the first hill, and sat down for a moment, a lovely couple walked by with a big dog,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that was proudly trotting with a very funny little-backpack on.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

mistake.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I waited a moment to let the couple go on ahead of me,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so that they could have the wilderness to themselves.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Slowly put my backpack on, which was heavy, with all the water,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and went on my way.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I was kind of half-heatedly looking for a nice site looking down from the top of the ancient dune,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you know I got to tell you, there was this unusual cool breeze which in the warm air felt like a miracle.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The

Woods.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It was only later that I found out that bears were re-introduced to Nordhouse,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">now that I think about it, it was probably on top of a bunch of bears quietly living there already.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It took a few moments to actually get to the sign that indicates that,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">this is the Nordhouse Wilderness Area,</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Few moments later the sites started popping up,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you can see patches of well worn exposed dirt where hikers or hunters camp, they are all very nice.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Mine ended up being the second or third, it was small and beautiful,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but to get there I had to descend down the ancient dune, not exactly an easy task with a heavy backpack on.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I set up my tent, and took to gathering up firewood for the evening,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">especially the chunky fallen logs which people usually can't carry as they can't chop them in pieces.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I bring a sharp saw, really sharp,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the dry fallen logs are much easier to cut and carry.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This time people dragged a huge fallen tree into the site,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they were using it for sitting, so I used that for fire, and to clean up the site so that there is nothing left but dirt.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Not sure what time it was but the sun was still up high,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so I set off for a long walk down the beach.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The dunes are very beautiful studded with big old trees,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">every-time you look you discover something different, a break in the tree line, or a sandy area where the dune parted for some reason,</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Or in this case an exceptionally tall stretch of dune,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">way taller than even I expected.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When I got back from my sunny walk,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I decided to walk the same distance, but now on the Arrowhead Trail in the woods.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I almost felt guilty about the beauty that was surrounding me,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and then I made an amazing discovery.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There was a fork in the trail that I have never noticed before,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the right path lead to a less worn trail that led up that gigantic dune I saw earlier.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Just as I was getting comfortable with being speechless about all the beauty around me,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">things became even more beautiful.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To get to the top of the high dune you had to climb the cutest little trail,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that dune could be one of the most beautiful features of Nordhouse.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And looking towards Lake Michigan you kind of see the lake in a new light as well,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it looks, well, more beautiful from that height as you get to see more waves, and what seems like a more distant horizon.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When I finally

  <p>Personally, I hope that as I get better at art,<br>all parts of my paintings will have their own little masks.</p>
  <p>A visor on a knight’s helmet, a hand, both shoes,<br>are all a good mask candidates.</p>
  <p>A knights helmet benefits from several masks,<br>one for the visor, others for any decorations and/or layers of armor.</p>

  <p>The biggest reason for masking,<br>is the ability to spray color on a helmet visor for example...</p>
  <p>Without any of that paint,<br>getting on the helmet.</p>
  <p>I mention knights armor,<br>because it is textured shiny metal.</p>
  <p>It is best to build up the colors here,<br>with long sprays that go up and down the armor.</p>
  <p>It wouldn't just be hard to color armor with a digital spray brush,<br>it maybe impossible to do it without masks.</p>

  <p>There does exist a simple mechanism for not going over the line,<br>it is referred to as making a selection.</p>
  <p>And it draws an ant line around pixels in the image,<br>whatever is within that ant line, will be impacted by a spray brush for example.</p>
  <p>A digital painting requires selecting multiple things many times over,<br>it would be very boring to continue carefully selecting everything.</p>
  <p>Here the process of saving a selection could be useful,<br>but there is a problem with selection.</p>
  <p>It is such a big problem,<br>that programmers kind of don’t bother adding that feature in.</p>
  <p>An ant line selection is a yes or no mechanism,<br>with the potential of feathering the edges, though equally all around.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>To make the long story short, due to the yes or no nature of selection,<br>you can’t feather a shadow along with the sharp outline of some artifact.</p>
  <p>But when you use masks, which by default use white for select and black for deselect,<br>you are allowed to use all the shades of gray between black and white, to mark selection strength.</p>
  <p>Another way to think about selection strength,<br>is transparency of the area.</p>
  <p>It is reasonable to gently keep a shadow selected for operations,<br>but here you think of it in terms of transparency.</p>
  <p>After all that is what feathering means,<br>don't completely affect the are, but do so just ever so barely, almost invisibly.</p>

  <p>Masking is a large feature,<br>to make it go, programmers build it into the concept of layers.</p>
  <p>So the full name for the masking feature,<br>is “LAYER MASKS”</p>
  <p>You may ask “Does Krita support layer masks?”,<br>“Yes, yes it does - it works just like in GIMP.”</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>This also means that you have to divide your image into layers,<br>while being mindful of masks.</p>
  <p>When a person is starting out Digital Painting,<br>it may make sense to put an entire Knight’s helmet on a single layer.</p>
  <p>It is the very top of the Knight,<br>keeping it on a separate layer is perfectly reasonable.</p>
  <p>But with masking,<br>you want to break the helmet up into all its components.</p>
  <p>You want a separate layer mask for the helmet visor,<br>because you will need to spray the metal gradient at a slight offset.</p>

  <p>Finally, the feather on a knights head, is a good example of... feathering,<br>the feather will not use a white color, it will be bright gray to make the feather slightly transparent.</p>
  <p>And the gray will get darker towards the edges,<br>to softly fade the feather out, for the ultimate touch of headdress realism.</p>

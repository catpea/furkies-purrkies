    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I wanted the teacher,<br>to help me understand Slavoj Žižek.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I spent countless hours,<br>listening to his nose issue, and I don't get anything.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I needed help separating Ayn Rand the Philosopher,<br>from Ayn Rand the Politician.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even though Ms. Rand would probably say,<br>it is impossible, I think her mind was too good for Politics.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The Philosophy teacher only talked about Descartes,<br>and some trivial Boolean inference.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Right before finals a boy got up,<br>and asked who is the Des-carte-s guy (he didn't know how Descartes is spelled).</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As to the logic, it would be brilliant,<br>to code up a little inference engine.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We could all reason about it,<br>extend it and search for flaws.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Walking away from a Philosophy class with code for an expert system,<br>is the only way a Philosophy teacher can show class.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And that boy, He just does finals,<br>because that is what you do when a school does not teach.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Pretending Memorization is Education,<br>and paying $500 bucks for course plus $200 for sh&t-books is a lot worse....</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Than thinking Descartes and Des-cate-s,<br>are two different people.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That was the best class the college had,<br>so I took art to relax and just people watch instead.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">First time I was painting Mona Lisas,<br>I left some pain on the easel, the main teacher called me a pig behind my back.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We had a substitute teacher just come in and linger for a bit,<br>and her and I briefly spoke about education.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">She said "Teenagers Are Hormones" and I realized,<br>teachers are not just ripping us off, they are insulting us behind our backs too - it part of their friendship making.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Second time, when the teacher that called me a pig was going to lecture in a class I signed up for,<br>I told her I had a 4.0 that I wanted to protect...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because I just assumed she was unreliable,<br>and she lit up with the words "New Assistant" or something like it, in her eyes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Not bloody likely, but,<br>I taught her how to use a wall projector, and do straight lines with acrylic.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The trick to prevent paint getting beneath the painters tape,<br>is to first leak pain t in there on purpose, but of the color that is already there, in order to seal the tape gap.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So if you want to paint a yellow square on a blue background,<br>you tape off a square, and then paint it the same color as the background that is already there.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The paint is going to leak beneath the tape, but it won't be noticeable,<br>the thing is, your yellow layer won't be able to leak beneath the tape anymore, the blue sealed your tape.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So you paint your yellow square, and peal the tape,<br>you will see some fresh blue paint, that leaked under the tape, but no yellow leaks.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You will have a square so sharp,<br>that you will wish it was a lite bit crooked as now all your other lines have to be equally as perfect.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Instead she thought the crooked figure was superior,<br>she was pushing untrained students to doodle, and she'd grade that.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Where what they needed was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKtURFkwX6k">help with proportion tools</a>,<br>so that they could move past it, and into tone and color.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A crooked untrained figure says title about an artist,<br>but grading it says quite a lot about the teacher.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Grids, projectors, Camera Obscura, Vincent van Gogh's Diamond frame,<br>Image References in Krita, semi-transparent layers in other programs - teach.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They train the hand and eye,<br>better than any teacher ever, EVER, will.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I saw them talk about what I said slowly turning towards me under shady tree from a distance,<br>maybe they just went home.</div>

  <p>It begins within,<br>and it leads outside of the culture you are born into.</p>
  <p>There is an ever evolving universal culture,<br>but any question of border.</p>

  <p>At the very least,<br>so that it does not continue repeating its mistakes.</p>

  <p>There is no preacher out there that has the answers,<br>nor will a philosopher ever have the time to answer all your questions.</p>
  <p>You have to answer them,<br>you have to become the great being you once wished to speak to.</p>
  <p>It has always been you,<br>and the road has always been the same.</p>
  <p>It has been paved with the most powerful books,<br>written by the Humans that have risen to the greatest heights they could reach. </p>
  <p>Because we each have different constellation of curiosities,<br>our paths will be unique.</p>
  <p>This is why standardized schools are such an insult,<br>to who we are meant to be.</p>
  <p>This is why real schools are yet to be built,<br>and it is in part why the world needs you.</p>

  <p>There isn't a past,<br>or a great mind that held or holds a plan.</p>
  <p>You are the best hope there has eve been,<br>by virtue of your youth, the clarity of your mind.</p>
  <p>And because you are,<br>new to all this.</p>
  <p>Because there is hope,<br>that you will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EknD3KRtgDk">go around the indoctrination</a>.</p>

  <p>It has only ever been the Philosophers,<br>who held the answers.</p>
  <p>The daughters of philosophy,<br>the sciences, can only make tools.</p>
  <p>The daughters,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb13ynu3Iac">will not teach how to use them</a>.</p>

  <p>One of the highest questions,<br>that has been posed recently.</p>
  <p>Is, would you relive your life,<br>infinite number of times.</p>
  <p>If the answer is no,<br>then it is the same as choosing an end.</p>
  <p>Which is,<br>very wrong.</p>
  <p>What is more,<br>we cannot push others, to choose an end.</p>
  <p>Are the choices you are making helping you,<br>or are they hurting you.</p>
  <p>If an end is what you wish for,<br>then you have chosen your path unwisely.</p>
  <p>Often that means that you are choosing from within the culture,<br>you have been born into,</p>
  <p>Often cultures trap people,<br>to make them obedient, more useful, to propagate some safe fantasy.</p>
  <p>Often for a a little bit of going,<br>from a lot of people.</p>

  <p>We have a flaw in our mind,<br>a terrible knot.</p>
  <p>It is the thing,<br>that makes a person stay in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVV2Zk88beY">cult</a>.</p>
  <p>It is because,<br>we can’t make decisions based on things we don’t know.</p>

  <p>And that is why I speak of books,<br>from which you can inherit wisdom.</p>
  <p>Become a philosopher,<br>who rises to no end in sight.</p>
  <p>It is an important part of growing up,<br>growing all the way up.</p>
  <p>More than that,<br>when all those around you start growing all the way up too.</p>
  <p>Then the world will become a safer place,<br>a wiser place.</p>
  <p>Then we will take to building the schools we need,<br>to making money work for us, not against us.</p>
  <p>And finally to putting this idea of world destroying weapons,<br>and that war is somehow a thing we do... behind us.</p>
  <p>The politicians you have heard speaking,<br>will retire soon.</p>
  <p>Despite what they have always told you,<br>and how you have been treated, it has always been about you.</p>
  <p>You are the hope,<br>and you are the dream.</p>
  <p>You just need to become a Philosopher,<br>so that you will know where to go next, from within, and not by being told what to do.</p>
  <p>Don’t let school slow you down,<br><a href="https://www.qwant.com/?q=Download+Giants+Of+Philosophy&client=opensearch&t=web">start in the beginning</a>.</p>

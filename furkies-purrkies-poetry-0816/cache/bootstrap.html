    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Which is,<br>very wrong.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What is more,<br>we cannot push others, to choose an end.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Are the choices you are making helping you,<br>or are they hurting you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If an end is what you wish for,<br>then you have chosen your path unwisely.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Often that means that you are choosing from within the culture,<br>you have been born into,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Often cultures trap people,<br>to make them obedient, more useful, to propagate some safe fantasy.</div>

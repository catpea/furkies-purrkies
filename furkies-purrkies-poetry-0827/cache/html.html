  <p>Not everything has to be complicated,<br>the most important thing is to have fun.</p>
  <p>It is silly to try to learn with having fun,<br>it is actually where medical malpractice comes from.</p>
  <p>Try as he might - and try not to ponder this too much,<br>but your doctor would fail all the medical quizzes and exams if he took them today.</p>
  <p>And that's not even mentioning,<br>High School and College Exams.</p>
  <p>So don’t be like your Doctor,<br>and learn for real.</p>
  <p>Which is to say,<br>have fun.</p>
  <p>Blender has a Sculpting Mode,<br>where you are presented with a Sphere you can sculpt.</p>

  <p>You need to take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEB91bRkPXE">sculpting tutorial</a>,<br>and learn about re-meshing or enabling dynamic topology.</p>
  <p>And then a Blender Boolean Modifier tutorial,<br>to attach a loop for a chain.</p>
  <p>And that is all the hard stuff,<br>because 3D printing does not require thinking about molds.</p>
  <p>A 3D printer takes care of the inside area of your creation automatically,<br>it uses just <strong>enough</strong> filament to make your creation sturdy.</p>

  <p>To make things easier,<br>you can model something with a tail looped in a loop.</p>
  <p>For example a cat, that has a loop in a tail,<br>at that is how you would attach it to your chain.</p>
  <p>You can model something that looks like,<br>it is hanging on to your key-chain as well.</p>
  <p>A monkey, an octopus,<br>or a cheerful misshapen raccoon.</p>
  <p>This lets you skip the whole Boolean modifier step,<br>so that you are printing a ready to hang pendant.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>That is all there is too it,<br>it is easy to make pendants.</p>
  <p>If you want a tiny challenge though,<br>strategise about your creatures so that not only do they not need a loop.</p>
  <p>But they don’t need special mold considerations<br>when printing or casting in gold - this way you can make a complete jewelry piece.</p>
  <p>Pendants are special,<br>because they don’t have sizes like rings or bracelets.</p>
  <p>And don’t forget that earring are a kind of a pendant too,<br>as you learn more you will be able to decorate your rings with your creations too.</p>

  <p>So once you finish a wireframe-like octopus,<br>or a flat creature, like a long cat relief pendant.</p>
  <p>So as long as the octopus is hanging onto the chain,<br>or the kitty has a loop in its tail.</p>
  <p>You upload it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Shapeways">your online-printing-service store front</a>,<br>and you have both a gold jewelry piece for sale, and a new entry in your design portfolio.</p>

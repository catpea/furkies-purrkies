    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Try as he might - and try not to ponder this too much,<br>but your doctor would fail all the medical quizzes and exams if he took them today.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And that's not even mentioning,<br>High School and College Exams.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So don’t be like your Doctor,<br>and learn for real.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You need to take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEB91bRkPXE">sculpting tutorial</a>,<br>and learn about re-meshing or enabling dynamic topology.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then a Blender Boolean Modifier tutorial,<br>to attach a loop for a chain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And that is all the hard stuff,<br>because 3D printing does not require thinking about molds.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To make things easier,<br>you can model something with a tail looped in a loop.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example a cat, that has a loop in a tail,<br>at that is how you would attach it to your chain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can model something that looks like,<br>it is hanging on to your key-chain as well.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A monkey, an octopus,<br>or a cheerful misshapen raccoon.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you want a tiny challenge though,<br>strategise about your creatures so that not only do they not need a loop.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But they don’t need special mold considerations<br>when printing or casting in gold - this way you can make a complete jewelry piece.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Pendants are special,<br>because they don’t have sizes like rings or bracelets.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And don’t forget that earring are a kind of a pendant too,<br>as you learn more you will be able to decorate your rings with your creations too.</div>

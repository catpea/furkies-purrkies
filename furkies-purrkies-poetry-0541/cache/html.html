  <p>Growing up is important for Humanity as well,<br>right now poverty prevents people from caring about Earth.</p>
  <p>All people of Earth are a single family,<br>and we all have a single aim, Wisdom onward to Greatness.</p>

  <p>There is no disagreement about what is wise and what is not,<br>wisdom is a universal thing - it does not create borders.</p>
  <p>Humanity must converge on wisdom,<br>to find Peace, but also energy that will help us look around and see far into the future.</p>

  <p>We have to learn to ask if the systems that humanity invented,<br>are helping or hurting us.</p>
  <p>Wold Poverty is hurting us,<br>and to fix it, all people of earth need a special credit card.</p>
  <p>An Inalienable Human Right,<br>no one will ever go hungry, or homeless.</p>
  <p>Our tolerance of ineffective education,<br>shows that the world is standing still.</p>
  <p>The credit card will not track debt,<br>and only feature a daily spending limit to prevent run-away anomalies.</p>

  <p>The card is the result of asking,<br>if poverty is helping or hurting us.</p>
  <p>The card is also a reminder that Humanity must advance,<br>we can't just stop at mutually assured destruction, pointless wars, and mass surveillance.</p>
  <p>There is no progress to be made here,<br>poverty is an error that will manufacture the need for weapons of mass destruction, endless conflicts, and the kinds of people that need to be monitored.</p>
  <p>Just like a city can't put it's poor out on the street,<br>and then start filling up prisons when they loos their minds.</p>
  <p>Humanity must stop creating artificial problems for it self,<br>it has to begin looking at Earth - that is our only real home.</p>

  <p>If poverty is hurting Humanity,<br>and not only preventing it from seeing the consequences of its own actions.</p>
  <p>But also creates many problems that would be prevented,<br>had it advanced far enough to end poverty.</p>
  <p>Then our biggest problem that requires immediate attention,<br>is the creation of a wold bank that has a card for all.</p>
  <p>Money is just an invention,<br>all we need to do is add that extra component to it, a credit card with a reasonable spending limit for all.</p>

  <p>Even teachers can't teach,<br>when they need to focus all their attention on putting food on their table.</p>

  <p>What needs to be made clear,<br>is that this is not some Utopian idea.</p>
  <p>This isn't just meant to help us,<br>this is meant to push the world into Wisdom.</p>
  <p>It is meant to give Humanity time,<br>to look at it self, to look at where it is going, and identify the wisest path ahead - and advance.</p>

  <p>Too many of Humanity's mistakes are being repeated all around the world,<br>we are one family, it matters what all the people of the world face.</p>
  <p>We can't hope for nations to come to an agreement,<br>but we can build a bank that will give the people a new credit card, that never expires, that never runs out.</p>

  <p>Humanity must grow,<br>we have to outgrow the blind repetitions of our mistakes, we have to learn to think about the future generations and their world, and their well being.</p>
  <p>They are our family,<br>and we muse search for ways to help them, eliminating world poverty should be our primary concern.</p>
  <p>It will help people to books, it will help teachers to teach,<br>it will help us to see, to see that we are one family, and that borders are a silly invention.</p>

  <p>Remember that one of Humanity's greatest treasures,<br>is the realization that we are all born equal, and that we have a right to Liberty, and Happiness.</p>
  <p>World Poverty,<br>is the opposite of that, it is about inequality, wage slavery, and it takes away from happiness - and certainly the happiness of the future generations.</p>
  <p>(Here is a more modern version.)</p>
  <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Human Beings are equal,<br>that they are endowed unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Freedom, and Happiness.</p>
  <p>A Life, filled with Knowledge, that ignites Wisdom, that Fuels Greatness.</p>
  <p>Freedom, from man made problems, like Poverty, Uneducation, War, and Weapons of Mass Destruction.</p>
  <p>And Happiness, that is rooted in Authentic Achievement, Real Education, Brilliant Content Of Character,<br>and knowing that one's Contributions create a lasting an meaningful difference both in in life, and as a treasured legacy and a source of wisdom for generations to come.</p>

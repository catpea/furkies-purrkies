Running on ice,
just isn't very nice.
I tried it thrice,
and it was not very wise.
Once I slid so far,
I felt like an ice skating star.

It is best not to roll the dice,
and avoid running on ice.
Patches of ice on a sidewalk are particularly bad,
that's what I had.
Just wait for the sun to melt the woe,
rest, and allow your muscles to grow.

Or find the nearest trail-head,
and go on a little adventure instead.
Dress warmly and bring soup,
call your friends and go as a troop.
A walk in a snowy park is very nice,
it is much better than running on ice.

It is important to remember,
that there is such a thing as a hot December.
If it is snow you fear,
then vacation on the other hemisphere.
Where hot and cold are reversed,
and it is rainy at worst.

Any who, I made you a little rhyme,
that will prevent trouble in no time.
It is a rule we mustn't break,
as there is too much at stake:
"Ice is cursed,
safety first."

Be it a woodland or tropical forest,
adventure at home or as a tourist...
Be safe and have fun,
and share stories with everyone.
Take plenty of photos and frame them all,
as no adventure is too small.

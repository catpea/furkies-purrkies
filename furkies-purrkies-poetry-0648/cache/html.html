  <p>Art is more,<br>because it's unconstrained.</p>
  <p>A great man once said that out final freedom,<br>is to choose how we face the inescapable.</p>
  <p>But art shows that there is infinitely more,<br>because our ability to dream is infinite.</p>

  <p>How we triumph over the sickened bullies,<br>by not becoming the snarling beasts that they are.</p>
  <p>How we become unbreakable by ignoring the simpler wrong,<br>and taking the much harder right.</p>
  <p>And how our awe for great beings,<br>teaches us not to kneel but to rise even higher.</p>
  <p>And though a broken school can do its best to dull curiosity,<br>its source within is unending.</p>

  <p>If you follow each step with another,<br>you cannot be helped but to travel unlimited roads.</p>

  <p>We must remind the little ones,<br>that they are meant to become great beings.</p>
  <p>That in the absence of real schools,<br>they have to become the teachers.</p>
  <p>And remind them that poverty is not a fault of theirs,<br>but like all the other wrongs, an error, to be repaired.</p>
  <p>To the little ones belongs the world,<br>we have to remind them, that they are meant to grow <strong>all</strong> the way up.</p>

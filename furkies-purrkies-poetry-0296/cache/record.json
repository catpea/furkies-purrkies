  "text": "The educational shortcut,\nis always a lie.\nThe only thing we will find in a shortcut,\nis a fantasy or fairy tale, an impression of education, or make-believe success.\n\nThere is really no need to take shortcuts in life,\nlearning and growing up is beautiful.\nGrowing up, is an act of endless tiny adventures,\nas you pursue your little curiosities onward to wisdom.\nMost adventures are very poetic, adventures in spirit so to speak,\nsuch as learning to paint low-brow art with oil on canvas, whilst listening to Kenji Kawai.\nMany adventures are actual expeditions that involve backpacks and sometimes even tents,\nit still counts, when you only camp in your backyard; an adventure is an adventure.\n\nThe more advanced art of listening to audio books when hiking through a little wilderness,\nis so pleasant, so relaxing and educational that no one should want to skip it.\nWhen books are read to us,\nwe really connect with what the author is saying.\nReading books with our own inner-voice, is not perfect because we bring in our own worries and tone,\nthe book is always tethered down with what is going on in our life and what comes tomorrow.\nBooks are stories that must be told with passion,\nand by an external voice, with some approval from the author; if not the author her self.\n\nIt is not possible to walk through the woods, and sticks and roots,\nand read a book in such a way that we can hear the author try to teach us wisdom.\nYes, it is important that we walk through green valleys and fragrant woodlands,\nit is not the same to listen to a book in the busy streets of a city full of strangers.\nNature has a very powerful impact on us,\nit makes us slow down, it makes us calmer, we sleep at sunset and awake at sun rise.\nWithout fears, distractions, and the hurry of the busy life,\nbooks begin fitting into our lifestyle as our heart begins to call for wisdom.\n\nNature and Books are opposite of shortcuts, they\ncreate very long and wise lives.\nThis is a lifestyle of learning and growing up,\nit cannot hurt us, it can only make us better, and it will spare us mistakes.\nIn this kind of life,\nno one will push you to hurry up.\nNo one will frighten you, or lie to you,\nhere you just cheerfully move at your own speed.\n\nAlways thinking,\nand always learning, always growing up.\n\nIn the life that we are all expected to live,\npeople lie when they say college will grant you a successful career.\n\nOnly you can guarantee yourself a successful career,\nand you have to start very early, maybe as early as middle-school.\nYou have to begin thinking about co-founding a series of tiny companies\nthat will help you learn about business, and what it means to be a leader, a founder, and a CEO.\nYou have to discover and follow your passions,\nand further your inventions.\nReal investors don't care much for a sales pitch with an elevator cartoon,\nthey look for genius, passion, sanity, and long therm visions.\n\nOn the other hand working for somebody else under several management layers,\ndoes not guarantee a healthy career.\nWe maybe forced into stress, overwork,\nand have all our balance drained from us.\nJust because we can work at a breakneck speed,\nit does not mean that we should, that kind of lifestyle is very dangerous.\nServitude of this kind will make us age faster,\nlong after the bosses tried to tell us \"life is not fair\" we will still suffer from effects of overwork.\n\nWe must keep a healthy balance with day and night and nature,\nwe are not machines, we are poetry.\n\nThere are no shortcuts,\nand learning is beautiful.\nFor one you never stop learning, and two; life never stops challenging you,\nand three, you must live healthy.\nTake good care of your self,\nit is the lifetimes of wisdom you inherit from all the books that make the biggest difference.\nLife is meant to be lived beautifully and cheerfully;\nconsciousness is such an impossible gift from the Universe, that without a doubt, you are meant to be happy.",

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We understand that a semester has lectures or classes,<br>and we know that a class or a lecture can couch on multiple topics.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is a broken idea,<br>there must be only one topic per lecture.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not allowed to discuss the area of a square and a circle,<br>a lecture end when the student grasps the topic.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In the kinds of fake schools that we have today,<br>a 45 minute lecture would be reduced to 10 minutes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And that is correct a lecture can last 10 minutes.<br>that this seems pointless in a High School or College setting, is their problem.</div>

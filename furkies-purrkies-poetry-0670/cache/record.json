working.\nLeaders want workers,\nteachers want food.\n\nLet us replace the word smart with the word intelligent,\nwhich in my opinion also describes a person who has class.\nIt is easy to fake being smart,\njust pretending to be quick witted is all it takes.\nFrom the ground up we must guard against liars,\nliars work on a different level.\nIntelligent people can spend generations building great cities,\nbut all a liar needs, to undo all that work, is a lit match.\n\nAnd let me clarify one more thing,\nbefore I explain how to quickly fix education.\nWe understand that a semester has lectures or classes,\nand we know that a class or a lecture can couch on multiple topics.\nThis is a broken idea,\nthere must be only one topic per lecture.\nIt is not allowed to discuss the area of a square and a circle,\na lecture end when the student grasps the topic.\nIn the kinds of fake schools that we have today,\na 45 minute lecture would be reduced to 10 minutes.\nAnd that is correct a lecture can last 10 minutes.\nthat this seems pointless in a High School or College setting, is their problem.\n\nI somewhat hate to say it, but the new educational system,\nis an electronic gadget.\nIt will work fine as an app on a cheap smartphone,\nthough there must be an audio only version.\nNot everyone can read,\nnot everyone can see.\nIn fact the audio device can't even have a,\n\"press and hold\" to turn on, it needs a regular button that lights up.\n\nThe audio version will become the most beloved masterpiece,\nI am certain it will be used as an introduction to the more interactive version or versions.\n\nIt is not as simple as using an audio player,\nbecause the user must be allowed to choose the next topic.\nMy favorite book, \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" by Bill Bryson,\nhas only one flaw, you can't choose your path through it.\nThe choose your own path,\nsimilar to \"Choose Your Own Adventure[1]\" books, is key.\nIn audio format the listener gets an overview,\nin the interactive phone app format the user begins on a journey of a lifetime.\nThey will build a unique portfolio,\nto replace all the fake resumes we have today...\nThey will build a path that cannot be forged,\na path as unique as their curiosities.\nWhen a user discovers a missing topic,\njust like in Wikipedia they will create it.\n\nThe topics or lectures have nothing to do with standardized education,\nthey will not aim to help students pass standardized tests.\nThere are no grades here,\njust the path.\nReviewing lessons learned and paths traveled,\nto aid in remembering important discoveries and ideas will be one of the many features of the interactive program.\nPart Wikipedia[2], part Wikiversity[3], part Khan Academy[4],\nit is a choose you own path school that presents topics in a way that helps to learn.\nIf a person wants to begin their education by selecting the vaccines topic,\nthey will be presented with hundreds of related topics after they watch the introduction.\nThis is not just a list of all things related to vaccines,\nbut a list of topics that are easy to grasp relative to the knowledge the user just acquired.\n\nThe content Creators, Editors, and Translators,\nare the students, what better way to learn than to contribute a topic.\nMore than just breaking away from standardized education,\nand useless tests that force students to memorize without comprehension.\nThe school aims to enable the students with new talents,\nin a way similar to Wikihow[5].\nEach topic expands the student's intelligence,\nthey grow in Knowledge, but also Wisdom, and Class.\nWhere the websites I mentions present information without an aim,\nthe Real School hopes to inspire each and every student to become a Great Being.\n \nReferences\n[1]:

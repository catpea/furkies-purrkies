  <p>For days I wanted to write a poem,<br>about becoming smart.</p>
  <p>Because a world leader who is responsible for education, and a failure,<br>called uneducated and unvaccinated people idiots.</p>
  <p>People protect what little they know,<br>the correct path forward is to lovingly help them to know more.</p>
  <p>Not insult them,<br>for standing up what they believe in.</p>

  <p>The reason the world is not advancing as smoothly as one would hope,<br>is because there are no honest leaders, only pretenders.</p>
  <p>It takes litter effort for a liar to destroy an honest person,<br>it may not be possible to have honest leaders.</p>
  <p>We must take education in our own hands,<br>without real education, intelligence, class and wisdom, the liars will use us.</p>
  <p>And then,<br>call us idiots.</p>

  <p>I've decided that writing about correcting world leaders,<br>is a waste of time.</p>
  <p>To call someone, who one is responsible for: an idiot,<br>is to cease being a leader of any kind.</p>

  <p>Some days into thinking about it,<br>I realized that nobody is interested in helping people become smart.</p>
  <p>The teachers were always focused on putting food on their table,<br>they will never figure out that teaching is not a job.</p>
  <p>And leaders of nations are concerned with employment figures,<br>they are clueless about what an education is.</p>
  <p>And to quote a movie, they "lack the mental capacity",<br>needed to grasp the fact that schools are not working.</p>
  <p>Leaders want workers,<br>teachers want food.</p>

  <p>Let us replace the word smart with the word intelligent,<br>which in my opinion also describes a person who has class.</p>
  <p>It is easy to fake being smart,<br>just pretending to be quick witted is all it takes.</p>
  <p>From the ground up we must guard against liars,<br>liars work on a different level.</p>
  <p>Intelligent people can spend generations building great cities,<br>but all a liar needs, to undo all that work, is a lit match.</p>

  <p>And let me clarify one more thing,<br>before I explain how to quickly fix education.</p>
  <p>We understand that a semester has lectures or classes,<br>and we know that a class or a lecture can couch on multiple topics.</p>
  <p>This is a broken idea,<br>there must be only one topic per lecture.</p>
  <p>It is not allowed to discuss the area of a square and a circle,<br>a lecture end when the student grasps the topic.</p>
  <p>In the kinds of fake schools that we have today,<br>a 45 minute lecture would be reduced to 10 minutes.</p>
  <p>And that is correct a lecture can last 10 minutes.<br>that this seems pointless in a High School or College setting, is their problem.</p>

  <p>I somewhat hate to say it, but the new educational system,<br>is an electronic gadget.</p>
  <p>It will work fine as an app on a cheap smartphone,<br>though there must be an audio only version.</p>
  <p>Not everyone can read,<br>not everyone can see.</p>
  <p>In fact the audio device can't even have a,<br>"press and hold" to turn on, it needs a regular button that lights up.</p>

  <p>The audio version will become the most beloved masterpiece,<br>I am certain it will be used as an introduction to the more interactive version or versions.</p>

  <p>It is not as simple as using an audio player,<br>because the user must be allowed to choose the next topic.</p>
  <p>My favorite book, "A Short History of Nearly Everything" by Bill Bryson,<br>has only one flaw, you can't choose your path through it.</p>
  <p>The choose your own path,<br>similar to "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-f5YelgmMs&t=124s">Choose Your Own Adventure</a>" books, is key.</p>
  <p>In audio format the listener gets an overview,<br>in the interactive phone app format the user begins on a journey of a lifetime.</p>
  <p>They will build a unique portfolio,<br>to replace all the fake resumes we have today...</p>
  <p>They will build a path that cannot be forged,<br>a path as unique as their curiosities.</p>
  <p>When a user discovers a missing topic,<br>just like in Wikipedia they will create it.</p>

  <p>The topics or lectures have nothing to do with standardized education,<br>they will not aim to help students pass standardized tests.</p>
  <p>There are no grades here,<br>just the path.</p>
  <p>Reviewing lessons learned and paths traveled,<br>to aid in remembering important discoveries and ideas will be one of the many features of the interactive program.</p>
  <p>Part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, part <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Main_Page">Wikiversity</a>, part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/khanacademy">Khan Academy</a>,<br>it is a choose you own path school that presents topics in a way that helps to learn.</p>
  <p>If a person wants to begin their education by selecting the vaccines topic,<br>they will be presented with hundreds of related topics after they watch the introduction.</p>
  <p>This is not just a list of all things related to vaccines,<br>but a list of topics that are easy to grasp relative to the knowledge the user just acquired.</p>

  <p>The content Creators, Editors, and Translators,<br>are the students, what better way to learn than to contribute a topic.</p>
  <p>More than just breaking away from standardized education,<br>and useless tests that force students to memorize without comprehension.</p>
  <p>The school aims to enable the students with new talents,<br>in a way similar to <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page">Wikihow</a>.</p>
  <p>Each topic expands the student's intelligence,<br>they grow in Knowledge, but also Wisdom, and Class.</p>
  <p>Where the websites I mentions present information without an aim,<br>the Real School hopes to inspire each and every student to become a Great Being.</p>

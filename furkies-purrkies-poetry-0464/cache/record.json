  "text": "Real Education and Cultural Convergence is one sure way towards World Peace,\nit requires that all the cultures of the Human Kind grow.\nIn order to make headway in this exhausting and near impossible Dream,\nwe have to stop making decisions in the now, and begin thinking in terms of generations.\n\nTo think in terms of generations,\nis to build real educational institutions that make a real positive difference.\nAn educational institution that makes a real positive difference,\nprovides its students - not with a self serving system of grades - but several independent student made businesses at graduation.\nIt is the creation of these businesses,\nthat will determine what topics of interest the student will reach out for.\nIn a very small, and restrained part,\nthe existence of these powerful international institutions is funded by a small temporary percentage of the student earnings.\nUnlike today Universities, these institutions are open to all,\nthey only take enough money to stay in business.\nAnd they server billions of students,\nwith the express purpose of Noble and Dignified Betterment of Human Kind.\nNo student will ever be expelled,\nthere will be no grades, no punishment, no records of wrong doing, only successful graduation.\n\nHeartbreakingly, our civilization has not yet progressed far enough,\nto successfully build these Loving Gigantic Institutions.\nHumanity is not yet ready to recognize the importance,\nnot get it right, as the project would be plagued with liars, pretenders, and failures; hoping for breadcrumbs.\nToday, more effort would go into protecting these institutions from liars,\nthen helping the students transcend their limitations.\n\nWithout getting too much into it, as there is too much to waste our time,\nfrom a very important perspective, heartbreakingly, it is illegal... under US constitution, to provide _all_ children, with universal education.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that,\n\"the benefits of universal education do not justify a violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\"\nWhich reads,\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\"\nOur civilization, is not yet ready to embrace real education,\nthese international institutions would fail to secure stable initial funding.\nAnd with heir importance misperceived as an attack on nationalism, or the spreading of globalism, or some other **** fairy tale,\nthey would be gutted, and taxed, and lose the meaningless and corrupt status of accreditation, and used as an example of what not to do.\nOur civilization is not ready to learn,\nthe hateful and arrogant politicians we elect show us how far behind on good ideas we truly are.\nThe way education works today,\ncreates a very uneven, luck based, dishonest and inauthentic, and in some cases hostile, surface for all the future generations.\n\nOrganized education can't yet work,\nbut there is a way around this, a path of self education that has already been followed countess times before[1].\nA way that revolves around encouraging all people all around the world,\nto accept the responsibility for their own education.\nThis is also the way that will helps them attack poverty by becoming business people,\nand it also serves as a way to clear the land for laying down foundations of the real schools.\n\nSchools of today are not teaching us[2], they have failed us[3],\nand we are being cheated out of important knowledge and wisdom[4].\nAs many of you have realized by now,\nwe have not, in fact received a real education, it was a m,make believe education.\nJust hard enough to make you feel that you were working hard,\nand that your hard won diploma, would lead you out of poverty and towards a beautiful future.\nThe people that you thought were smarter then you, were not actually smarter than you,\nthey were self-educating independently of the useless materials in school.\nThe people that became successful, became successful not because of luck,\nbut because they accepted the responsibility for their own education.\nLuck. is easy come,\neasy go, it doesn't stick around like Wisdom.\nPeople are confused about what education is,\nthey think books, Doctors, and Dentists, but those are just their boring jobs, that were a fun challenge to learn for.\nReal education, is about Knowledge inherited from countless lives found in powerful books,\nWisdom gained from living what is life.\nAnd above greatness,\nGreatness.\nGreatness of Restraint, Greatness of Dignity, Greatness of Nobility, Greatness of Unbreakability, Greatness of Fortitude, Greatness of Courage, Greatness of Honor, Greatness of Love;\nand Greatness of Insight;

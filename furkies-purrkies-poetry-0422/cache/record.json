class=\"paragraph\">And hang out in a chat-room together,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the use of bots in chartooms is nothing new, and that is good, you want to invent as little as possible.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The bots can talk to each other in the chat room,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Siri, can get Alexa to reorder things, and Cortana can get the Roomba going.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

<div class=\"paragraph\">The real fun comes in when you replace your <span>thermostat with a Rasperry PI<sup>[3]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and give it a human name to turn it

create text pages,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but also event-handler pages, that conveniently list what emits events and what listen to them under the \"What Links Here?\" section.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">One of the most useful events here is incoming-text which would be coming in from the chat-room IN ENGLISH,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and here a GUI interface would help the user either drop the message, or do something with it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes that something could be as simple as</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">conditionally contributing to the ongoing bot conversation in the chat-room.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So the Thermostat Bot, lets call her Amber,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">could report that that she is about to turn the heat on because it is only 65 degrees Fahrenheit.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Let us create a new bot, let us call her Bia, named after the Greek goddess of force, anger and raw energy</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and she will be responsible for conserving energy when nobody is home.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And programming this only deals with selecting Amber,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">as the bot to listen to, entering the text to monitor for which in this case is:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">\"I am about to turn the heat on because it is only * degrees Fahrenheit\",</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Exiting the program early,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">if the security bot Ansel reports human presence,</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And if the program keeps going this far,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">then issuing a delay order to Amber.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\"

together,\nthe use of bots in chartooms is nothing new, and that is good, you want to invent as little as possible.\n\nThe bots can talk to each other in the chat room,\nSiri, can get Alexa to reorder things, and Cortana can get the Roomba going.\n\nBut that is the least of it,\nall we did in this example, was to reduce the bloated technologies.\n\nHere we are replacing IFTTT,\nwith some bots that issue commands and some bots that execute them.\n\nThe real fun comes in when you replace your thermostat with a Rasperry PI,\nand give it a human name to turn it into another assistant that Siri, for example can talk to.\n\nThis gets us to a point, where there exist a chat-room with multiple robots,\nthat can list the commands they understand, and the commands will be in plain English.\n\nYou control which bots are in which chat room,\nthis serves as a security and customization mechanism.\n\nAt this point, we add a new robot,\none with a programming language that is easy to understand and mange.\n\nThis would be a WikiWikiWeb like program,\nthat revolves around the EventEmitter pattern.\n\nHere user can create text pages,\nbut also event-handler pages, that conveniently list what emits events and what listen to them under the \"What Links Here?\" section.\n\nOne of the most useful events here is incoming-text which would be coming in from the chat-room IN ENGLISH,\nand here a GUI interface would help the user either drop the message, or do something with it.\n\nSometimes that something could be as simple as\nconditionally contributing to the ongoing bot conversation in the chat-room.\n\nSo the Thermostat Bot, lets call her Amber,\ncould report that that she is about to turn the heat on because it is only 65 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nLet us create a new bot, let us call her Bia, named after the Greek goddess of force, anger and raw energy\nand she will be responsible for conserving energy when nobody is home.\n\nBia will respond to Amber to delay that order,\nuntil human presence is detected in the house, by the security system.\n\nAnd programming this only deals with selecting Amber,\nas the bot to listen to, entering the text to monitor for which in this case is:\n\n\"I am about to turn the heat on because it is only * degrees Fahrenheit\",\n\nExiting the program early,\nif the security bot Ansel reports human presence,\n\nAnd if the program keeps going this far,\nthen issuing a delay order to Amber.\n\nThis is a very simple programming language,\nthat revolves around basic input forms and easy to read text.\n\nMost of this would already be preset by the publisher,\nbut it is still accessible and understandable by the user.\n\nThis whole thing requires nothing more,\nthan a chat room, and a vision beyond a single assistant.\n\nImagine that couple returning from a weekend vacation,\nnoticing the long conversation log between Amber and Bia...\n\n...and modifying Amber's code to directly speak with Ansel,\nthe security bot that keeps track of presence of humans in the house.\n\nWhat we are doing here,\nis bringing every program under the same interface, the interface of Chat and Text.\n\nYou can still play computer games,\nand browse the internet with the latest browser.\n\nBut there is also an IRC server,\nwhere the robots in your house talk to each other.\n\nAnd EventEmitter flavored WikiWikiWeb,\ndesigned to outlast the house, designed long term operations.\n\nThere is never a problem with remembering what robots are in the house,\nas they all hang out in the lobby of the chat system.\n\nAnd it is not always necessary to program a thing,\nsometimes just logging in and typing in \"@Amber Turn the heat up to 73\" will suffice.\n\nIn conclusion, to think like an inventor,\nlook around you, the things that surround you, are the things that you manipulate to create something new.\n\nNever complicate things,\nsimplify them, you can't improve something by making it more complex.\n\nDon't be evil, don't be small minded,\nlife is too short for shallow thinking.\n\nYour inventions, or independent-inventions,\nas little as caps that you put on laces in sweat pants so that you can pull the lace out should one be pulled in by the washer.\n\nOr as big as big as the invention of a human readable programming language,\nbelong in your thick portfolio.\n\nJust imagine, shiny heavy covers with an intricate high resolution generative art graphic on the front,\nand your smiling face on the back... and maybe on the front too, why the heck not.\n\nDon't think of it as your portfolio,\nbut as a book of your inventions that also doubles as the portfolio.\n\nYou don't have to give TED talks,\nand these days you don't even need a publisher, just Printing On Demand.\n\nAnd remember to think of the leading companies as your private research laboratories,\npay attention to what they are doing where they are failing, and especially their shortcomings.\n\nThe business world is a dog scratch dog world,\nwhen you become world's most famous inventor, all of those companies will own and and study a copy of your portfolio.\n\nOh, and one more thing,\nalways put a \"Don't be evil\" clause in your legal paperwork.\n\nOnce the lawyers start calling you if that part can be removed...\njust say, no, and hang up.\n\n\n[postmarketOS]: https://postmarketos.org/\n[Alpine Linux]:

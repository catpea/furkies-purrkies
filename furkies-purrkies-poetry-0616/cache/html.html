  <p>Wisdom is always close,<br>sometimes as close as a snowflake on your nose.</p>
  <p>But it takes,<br>abut a hundred winter snowflakes.</p>
  <p>And just about as many narrated books at the library,<br>and perhaps a small dictionary.</p>
  <p>A hundred snowflakes that beautifully branch,<br>is all it takes to start that avalanche.</p>
  <p>And the first snowflake is right here:<br>you find all your favorite narrated books the first year.</p>

  <p>No one should tell you what book to start with,<br>as finding it will become your favorite story and myth.</p>
  <p>Half a century from now, come a sunny day,<br>you will say:</p>
  <p>(low tone)</p>
  <p>"A whole month it took,<br>to find my first beloved book".</p>
  <p>"At first I had to use a dictionary,<br>and walk uphill, both ways to and fro, the library."</p>
  <p>"And it snowed,<br>all never slowed."</p>

  <p>I am not sure what the snowflakes are,<br>but my first snowflake was the word, "Philosopher" and it shone like a star.</p>
  <p>It always seemed so magical to me,<br>that I knew that it was a key.</p>
  <p>And what moved me about Philosophers was how they speak,<br>and that they are timeless and never weak.</p>
  <p>It was never about some system,<br>it was always about their wisdom.</p>
  <p>It was easy to find as they always weave around their best thoughts,<br>so you just need to find the knots.</p>

  <p>Over time, I realized that wisdom is everywhere,<br>and finally that it belongs to those who care.</p>
  <p>Is it our right,<br>and it brings us great might.</p>
  <p>It enhances the power of introspection and seeing,<br>and calls to us to become a great being.</p>
  <p>Eventually I was just reading books about life,<br>and yes, they were all about finding wise ways out of strife.</p>
  <p>As I realized that the world is not as it looks,<br>I called it: inheriting lifetimes of wisdom from books.</p>

  <p>And wisdom is in deed the future of Human Kind,<br>as it is the only way with which we can enhance our mind.</p>
  <p>In wisdom we can eliminate poverty with a clever international bank,<br>for which future generations will thank.</p>
  <p>And only in wisdom will we create rules,<br>that will reshape and fix all the schools.</p>

  <p>Wisdom is so near,<br>that it is almost already here.</p>
  <p>All it will take for the world to rise,<br>is to remember the Philosophers and the ways of the wise.</p>

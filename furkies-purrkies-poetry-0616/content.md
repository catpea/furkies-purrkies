Wisdom is always close,
sometimes as close as a snowflake on your nose.

But it takes,
abut a hundred winter snowflakes.

And just about as many narrated books at the library,
and perhaps a small dictionary.

A hundred snowflakes that beautifully branch,
is all it takes to start that avalanche.

And the first snowflake is right here:
you find all your favorite narrated books the first year.

---

No one should tell you what book to start with,
as finding it will become your favorite story and myth.

Half a century from now, come a sunny day,
you will say:

(low tone)

"A whole month it took,
to find my first beloved book".

"At first I had to use a dictionary,
and walk uphill, both ways to and fro, the library."

"And it snowed,
all never slowed."

---

I am not sure what the snowflakes are,
but my first snowflake was the word, "Philosopher" and it shone like a star.

It always seemed so magical to me,
that I knew that it was a key.

And what moved me about Philosophers was how they speak,
and that they are timeless and never weak.

It was never about some system,
it was always about their wisdom.

It was easy to find as they always weave around their best thoughts,
so you just need to find the knots.

Over time, I realized that wisdom is everywhere,
and finally that it belongs to those who care.

Is it our right,
and it brings us great might.

It enhances the power of introspection and seeing,
and calls to us to become a great being.

Eventually I was just reading books about life,
and yes, they were all about finding wise ways out of strife.

As I realized that the world is not as it looks,
I called it: inheriting lifetimes of wisdom from books.

---

And wisdom is in deed the future of Human Kind,
as it is the only way with which we can enhance our mind.

In wisdom we can eliminate poverty with a clever international bank,
for which future generations will thank.

And only in wisdom will we create rules,
that will reshape and fix all the schools.

---

Wisdom is so near,
that it is almost already here.

All it will take for the world to rise,
is to remember the Philosophers and the ways of the wise.

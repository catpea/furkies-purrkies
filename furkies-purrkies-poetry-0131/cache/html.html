  <p>Summer and Winter, Spring, and Autumn are my favorite seasons,</p>
  <p>but today, Winter came to mind; for many reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>For one, it is Summer, a Hot Summer, Heatwave in full swing,</p>
  <p>and I can&apos;t believe what great relief; a little snowfall would bring.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>And I found a winter photo of an expedition to a near by store,</p>
  <p>I look thrice my size, I can&apos;t even imagine how many layers I wore.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Then I remembered when back in 2014 the Polar Vortex was all the talk,</p>
  <p>I was so excited to dress up and go on a long walk!</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>But, my favorite memory is riding my bicycle and hitting a patch of ice,</p>
  <p>I fell sideways upside-down, and did a little looptie-loop, twice.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>I landed perfectly flat with a winter splat kicking up the downy flake,</p>
  <p>and I lay there a bit muttering, &quot;What a story this will make&quot;.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>I love Blinding Summers, and Rainy Autumns, and Spring when all the flowers grow,</p>
  <p>but I am a huge fan of Winter and all that bright white snow.</p>

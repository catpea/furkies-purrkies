  <p>Most people mistakenly believe that Michigan,<br>is surrounded by what is know by Great Lakes.</p>
  <p>In reality, there is nothing lake about them,<br>those are great sweet water seas.</p>
  <p>Their real names are as follows,<br>The Michigan Sea, The Superior Sea, The Huron Sea, and The Erie Sea.</p>
  <p>Though I have personally never seen it,<br>some parts of the seas freeze in winter.</p>

  <p>Originally the full name for Michigan,<br>was Cape Michigan.</p>
  <p>A Cape is defined as,<br>“a large headland extending into a body of water, usually the sea”</p>
  <p>There is also a peninsula,<br>called the Upper Peninsula - often shortened to U.P. by the locals.</p>
  <p>And the Cape is bound to United States,<br>By means of a land named Oh Hi, Yo!</p>
  <p>Which is only technically, a state,<br>but it is really a welcoming point for the people arriving from the seas.</p>

  <p>Frequently, I would find myself thinking I am going one way,<br>but realizing, I was going elsewhere.</p>
  <p>I thrive on such wonderful events,<br>with one exception.</p>
  <p>Each time I arrive at Bowling Green, Oh Hi, Yo!<br>I realize that I have moved away from the seas, which is where all the fun if.</p>
  <p>Bowling Green is only as fun,<br>as it sounds.</p>
  <p>I cheerfully turned my car around,<br>knowing that now I am headed the right way on 275.</p>
  <p>And grabbed some chips,<br>while I was at it.</p>

  <p>Munching on my chips,<br>I figured I should drive as far as the roads take me.</p>
  <p>As Cape Michigan,<br>can only take you to more sea.</p>
  <p>I ended up In the U.P,<br>by crossing a large bridge</p>
  <p>I discovered a shipwreck museum,<br>and decided to search for a hotel, in Paradise City.</p>
  <p>The hotel I found was magnificent,<br>they had a model of a great ship in the lobby, and I doodled it into my journal.</p>
  <p>Oddly there wants anywhere to go,<br>but there was a tiny little store, and it was fun to look around.</p>
  <p>I spent most of the day enjoying looking at the Superior Sea,<br>it truly was a superior experience.</p>
  <p>Though as I rent down for dinner,<br>I left the windows open.</p>
  <p>And upon my return my room was filled with thousands of large mosquitoes,<br>so I grabbed a pillow and slept in the tub.</p>
  <p>The shipwreck museum was a dream,<br>but I spent most of the time wondering how it was possible that there were 500 shipwrecks there.</p>
  <p>You’d think they’d learn,<br>after one or two.</p>
  <p>I was there a goodie long while,<br>but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gFyH_cKWjk">I made the mistake of not becoming more interested in bird watching</a>.</p>
  <p>There is an entire community of bird watchers up there,<br>clearly this is something worth the while.</p>

  <p>It was on my meandering way towards the more southern seas,<br>that I discovered the City of Ludington.</p>
  <p>I stayed a whole month,<br>I explored the State Park, camped at the Jack Pine Hike-in sites, and got my first taste of Nordhouse Dunes.</p>
  <p>Nordhouse is a small wideness,<br>positioned on the coast of the Michigan Sea.</p>
  <p>I had many great little adventures there,<br>swam in the lake during the day, and and build little bonfires to roast sausages for dinner.</p>
  <p>Never had a problem with mosquitoes,<br>and wilderness was free to camp in, the optional parking just a few dollars per week.</p>

  <p>My second visit to Nordhouse featured a Magnificent Storm,<br>it was the most terrifying and majestic night of my life.</p>
  <p>I was awoken in the middle of the night,<br>it was great thunder and a proper downpour.</p>

  <p>The thunder was all around,<br>and I was surrounded by metal stakes in the ground.</p>
  <p>There was nowhere to go an nowhere to run,<br>just the bright flashes of the midnight sun.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk">I’ve put on a song I liked and the thunder grew tame</a>,<br>and before I knew it the morning came.</p>

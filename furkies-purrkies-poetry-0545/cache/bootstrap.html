    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In reality, there is nothing lake about them,<br>those are great sweet water seas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Their real names are as follows,<br>The Michigan Sea, The Superior Sea, The Huron Sea, and The Erie Sea.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though I have personally never seen it,<br>some parts of the seas freeze in winter.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Originally the full name for Michigan,<br>was Cape Michigan.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A Cape is defined as,<br>“a large headland extending into a body of water, usually the sea”</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is also a peninsula,<br>called the Upper Peninsula - often shortened to U.P. by the locals.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the Cape is bound to United States,<br>By means of a land named Oh Hi, Yo!</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Which is only technically, a state,<br>but it is really a welcoming point for the people arriving from the seas.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Each time I arrive at Bowling Green, Oh Hi, Yo!<br>I realize that I have moved away from the seas, which is where all the fun if.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I ended up In the U.P,<br>by crossing a large bridge</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I discovered a shipwreck museum,<br>and decided to search for a hotel, in Paradise City.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The hotel I found was magnificent,<br>they had a model of a great ship in the lobby, and I doodled it into my journal.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Oddly there wants anywhere to go,<br>but there was a tiny little store, and it was fun to look around.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I spent most of the day enjoying looking at the Superior Sea,<br>it truly was a superior experience.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though as I rent down for dinner,<br>I left the windows open.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And upon my return my room was filled with thousands of large mosquitoes,<br>so I grabbed a pillow and slept in the tub.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The shipwreck museum was a dream,<br>but I spent most of the time wondering how it was possible that there were 500 shipwrecks there.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You’d think they’d learn,<br>after one or two.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was there a goodie long while,<br>but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gFyH_cKWjk">I made the mistake of not becoming more interested in bird watching</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is an entire community of bird watchers up there,<br>clearly this is something worth the while.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I stayed a whole month,<br>I explored the State Park, camped at the Jack Pine Hike-in sites, and got my first taste of Nordhouse Dunes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Nordhouse is a small wideness,<br>positioned on the coast of the Michigan Sea.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I had many great little adventures there,<br>swam in the lake during the day, and and build little bonfires to roast sausages for dinner.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Never had a problem with mosquitoes,<br>and wilderness was free to camp in, the optional parking just a few dollars per week.</div>

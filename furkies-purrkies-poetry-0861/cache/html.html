  <p>Don't give up on Knowledge and Wisdom, don't let fake schools get to you, or derail you,<br>the cure to broken schools, is self education.</p>
  <p>This can sweetly begin with modern narrated books that are thought of as priceless,<br>by all the world intellectuals.</p>

  <p>It is hard to talk about fixing things,<br>because that is usually where all the fruitcakes hang out.</p>
  <p>But if your aim is self empowerment and intellectual independence,<br>by means of powerful life-long self education, then it is OK.</p>
  <p>We can see that schools do not seem care about life-long results,<br>institutions may not be able to care about issues that lead to their creation.</p>
  <p>Perhaps for as long as everyone is stuck in poverty,<br>all aims will be misaligned.</p>

  <p>Without a well educated world,<br>there is little room for conversation about powerful universal income and exit from poverty</p>
  <p>And although aims may misalign,<br>and perhaps it maybe impossible to learn in face of poverty, due to stress and fear.</p>
  <p>There are always exceptions, and thus, those who lead the change,<br>and here the exceptional individuals that emerge from self education.</p>
  <p>Are likely Humanity's fastest and best,<br>path towards building real schools that provide real and life-long results.</p>

  <p>Today, what students seem to be doing is entrusting their minds to the two groups of people,<br>that that failed to address poverty and brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war, again.</p>
  <p>Teachers and politicians, who are only as equipped to handle reality,<br>as the schools that they have attended.</p>
  <p>If those schools were broken or ineffective,<br>then so is their impression of the world.</p>

  <p>Look at the damage that has been done already,<br>schools attempt to teach by punishing with bad grades or by holding people back.</p>
  <p>But stress largely prevents learning, as true learning calls for joy,<br>and punishment can only force students into desperate memorization.</p>

  <p>Students have been tricked so bad,<br>that it sounds unbelievable when we think of the truth:</p>
  <p>That all minds are genius minds,<br>that every mind is as capable as those of Philosophers, Artists, Hackers, and Scientists.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it is as simple as the idea, that schools would have a very difficult time making money,<br>if all the students realized, that teachers just slow them all down.</p>
  <p>If you are being slowly convinced that your grade is a measure of your intelligence,<br>and that blind obedience is the cure for your bad grades...</p>
  <p>Then find a better teacher, a better school,<br>because that is hon how education works.</p>
  <p>Education is meant to be a happy adventure,<br>through all your most bountiful and curiosities.</p>

  <p>If you cant get to real and effective education,<br>then accept the responsibility for authentic and powerful self education.</p>
  <p>Real education starts with books that are held in high esteem by all the worlds intellectuals,<br>and the understanding that you cannot learn, what you are not yet curious about.</p>
  <p>Start in the beginning, with whatever curiosity is calling to you,<br>and knowing, that you are a genius.</p>
  <p>That you are a Royalty,<br>and the hope and dream of a better future.</p>

  <p>Afterword: If you have no idea where to start,<br>then surround yourself with narrated books start with the top sellers in non-fiction and science category.</p>
  <p>And then begin learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=krita+tutorial+for+beginners">Digital Painting with Krita</a>,<br>especially <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uCH2z_zLmc">make use of the reference images tool</a>, it is how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fEMJp70tGU">the most powerful artists do it</a>.</p>
  <p>And when you need a break, take to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+tutorial">3D Modeling and Printing with Blender</a>,<br>and/or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript+tutorial">Programming with modern JavaScript</a>.</p>
  <p>Even though banks have already bet on you, no career path is perfect, nor is it ever guaranteed,<br>but Art, Design, Industrial Design, and Software Development, are all very sturdy bets.</p>
  <p>And do not forget, that a Student Loan is a special kind of loan,<br>if you fail to pay it off, it will be extracted from your paycheck, these loans are not forgivable by bankruptcy.</p>
  <p>The banks have bet on both, on your failure and success,<br>and in your failure they will take money when you need it the most.</p>
  <p>You must ensure that your education is meaningful,<br>powerful, authentic and real.</p>
  <p>Humanity must advance past global poverty,<br>that holds us all hostage and often leads to war.</p>
  <p>Meaningful self education that leads to the creation of more powerful schools,<br>all around the globe, is our finest way forward.</p>

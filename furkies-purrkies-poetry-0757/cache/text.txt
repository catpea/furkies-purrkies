Teachers could teach for real,
but that's just not the deal.
They are there to follow,
slowly turning hollow.
Selling out for perks,
that is how the world works.

Teenagers shouldn't tolerate this,
or they’ll end up in the same abyss.
Nor should new teachers cheat,
or even take a back seat.

Medicine is priced for profit,
as high as CEO’s see fit.
Bank systems keep us poor,
dictators tell their prisoners to endure.
Teenagers are shipped to war,
because of some oath they swore.
Weapons are created to fight,
and never for doing what is right.
News is always spun with a slant,
little more than a rant.
Governments are staffed by lairs,
who only aim to light fires.
And the broken school,
only aims to sell you as a tool.

All of this works like a chain,
where every link propagates pain.
We pretend everything is fine,
but we have long ago crossed the line.
This cycle of mindlessness must end,
as we can no longer pretend.

You need real knowledge and explanation,
not a fake education.
Face the boogie man in school,
do not let them think you are a fool.
Don’t memorize, don’t pretend,
that does not lead to a very good end.
Hand in the tests blank,
tell them it is not a prank.
Tell them you need a real education,
and the madness will end with your generation.
Until you have real teachers,
and not just zombie preachers.
Read hundreds life changing books,
and you’ll do well standing up to all the crooks.
Help others your age,
make sure you’re all on the same page.
In the absence of teachers,
you become the teachers.
In the absence of peace and security,
you have to rise sooner to your maturity.
Generations younger to you,
deserve a wiser world and a better view.

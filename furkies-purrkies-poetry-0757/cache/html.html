  <p>Teachers could teach for real,<br>but that's just not the deal.</p>
  <p>They are there to follow,<br>slowly turning hollow.</p>
  <p>Selling out for perks,<br>that is how the world works.</p>

  <p>Teenagers shouldn't tolerate this,<br>or they’ll end up in the same abyss.</p>
  <p>Nor should new teachers cheat,<br>or even take a back seat.</p>

  <p>Medicine is priced for profit,<br>as high as CEO’s see fit.</p>
  <p>Bank systems keep us poor,<br>dictators tell their prisoners to endure.</p>
  <p>Teenagers are shipped to war,<br>because of some oath they swore.</p>
  <p>Weapons are created to fight,<br>and never for doing what is right.</p>
  <p>News is always spun with a slant,<br>little more than a rant.</p>
  <p>Governments are staffed by lairs,<br>who only aim to light fires.</p>
  <p>And the broken school,<br>only aims to sell you as a tool.</p>

  <p>All of this works like a chain,<br>where every link propagates pain.</p>

  <p>You need real knowledge and explanation,<br>not a fake education.</p>
  <p>Face the boogie man in school,<br>do not let them think you are a fool.</p>
  <p>Don’t memorize, don’t pretend,<br>that does not lead to a very good end.</p>
  <p>Hand in the tests blank,<br>tell them it is not a prank.</p>
  <p>Tell them you need a real education,<br>and the madness will end with your generation.</p>
  <p>Until you have real teachers,<br>and not just zombie preachers.</p>
  <p>Read hundreds life changing books,<br>and you’ll do well standing up to all the crooks.</p>
  <p>Help others your age,<br>make sure you’re all on the same page.</p>
  <p>In the absence of teachers,<br>you become the teachers.</p>
  <p>In the absence of peace and security,<br>you have to rise sooner to your maturity.</p>
  <p>Generations younger to you,<br>deserve a wiser world and a better view.</p>

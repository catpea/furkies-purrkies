Most of us ignore the idea of genius,
because nothing profound can come from it.

But we needn't be like that,
we are all geniuses.

Genius is a state that we can all easily make our way into,
it requires rest, a happy place, and Happiness.

It is a state that we should live-in; for a long time,
little notebook in back pocket, that trusty old mechanical pencil.

It is a state of cheerfulness and serenity,
peacefulness and long, long, looooooooooooong thoughts.

Sometimes it is not easy to reach that state,
life gets busy and sometimes sad.

But sadness has its place in happiness too,
and no one is granted the right to stay permanently unhappy.

For those of us who struggle to get there, long nature trails, were invented to serve as a quick emergency access point,
and they are everywhere, and all over the world.

All you need is a loaf of bread,
and some bug spray.

When we are little, parents remind us that we are not to follow,
with that curiously morbid "If everyone was jumping out of the window, would you jump out too?"

But we get caught up in life,
chasing promotions and paychecks, mortgage payments, and student loan debt.

But we can't say that we are ourselves when we are in that state,
and when you really think about it...

We aren't really doing anybody any service,
by being constantly overworked and over-worried, and generally being other than we really are.

Those who care about us,
expect us to be who we really are at all times, they care because they appreciate who we are.

Overwork, stress, chasing promotions, quotas,
diplomas, patents, deadlines, and all that hard work... needs to be pushed all the way in the back.

We _must be_ who we really are,
because that is how we grow.

We should never fall behind on growing up,
not for a day, not for an hour.

Our beauty depends on always moving onward,
and always bettering ourselves.

Our natural instinct is to always cheerfully advance forward,
in pursuit of our curiosities and dreams.

That is what the state of genius really is,
finding comfort and balance in advancing forward in life.

As we each take to unique curiosities and paths,
our genius too, grows unique.

There is no real definition of genius,
because no two people are the same.

But we know that is is precious and sweet,
and irreplaceable, and worth the while.

In a way it is something that outlines the presence of the person that shares it with us,
and should the person quit sharing we, almost instantly, long for more.

And the same goes for us, when we set off on that great adventure, and return to tell the story,
our listeners will be sure to wish for more.

Take good care care of your genius and adventure,
don't forget about your neat and interesting curiosities, as they pave a way forward towards accomplishment, cheerfulness and serenity.

We are too good, at working too hard,
this is why we must stay on guard.
Your mind is more than just a tool,
it is a rare and beautiful jewel.
Many hope that you will never know,
that your generation is the new new hope, for the world to grow.
But, if we just close our eyes and let mistakes repeat,
the world will fade away in silent defeat.
Go, take to adventure, pack, and get into you car,
so that you will never forget who you really are.

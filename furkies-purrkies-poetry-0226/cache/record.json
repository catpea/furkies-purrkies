  "text": "Do not drop out of High School,\nthe Back Row is a special place.\nIt is how the Universe asks for help,\nyou are being asked to watch for trouble.\nTo keep an eye on your bullies,\nmake sure they all come back from home.\nTheir violence is an expression of abuse,\nthere is nothing you can do.\nYou are being asked to stare into the Teachers Soul,\nespecially when the bullies come, and she turns her head.\nAnd you are being asked to be the first one to call the police,\nif someone is in danger, get everything on video, upload.\nWatch the Security Guards[1],\nmake sure that everyone is keeping a distance from all the students.\n\nSo, by now the teachers have you half way,\ntowards believing that you are dumb, a loser, and a waste of time.\nThey have been using you to tidy up their Grade Statistics,\ntheir statistics can't stick out[2], they need a usual distribution of grades.\nIf it was all As, someone would come around asking why,\nyou are the \"F\" that makes their bullshit look legitimate.\n\nI know, you know, that your grades your bad, because you were not learning before,\nand now you don't have the base, that would help you understand what the teacher is saying right now.\nBut you are wrong.\nNobody else learned that stuff either,\neven some of the kids that had tutors, didn't learn it, they just memorized it.\nYou'd have to be a freak of nature,\nto actually comprehend that curriculum, please, please, don't memorize garbage.\nBe careful, the teachers, and principals maybe suffering a kind of collective delusion:\n\"...The principal and I rejected his alibi and hung a fat zero on his final exam.\nThat dropped his precalculus grade down from a B+ to a D+.\nIt lingered like a purple bruise on his college applications.\"\nBen Orlin \"When Memorization Gets in the Way of Learning\" The Atlantic, September 9, 2013[3].\n\nYou are just as smart as everybody else,\nyou are just as smart as Newton was before he started reading books he liked.\nThere are no gifted individuals,\nbut there are individuals who like being celebrated as gifted, of special, or above all else.\nThey want it so bad,\nthat they go home and memorize that garbage, garbage.\n\nEven though your mind is perfectly fine,\nyou still need Knowledge, you need an integrated picture of the world.\nA clear picture constructed out of a hundred books,\nloved an admired by Intellectuals, Scientists, Philosophers, those who show great achievement.\nBy sitting in the back row, and constantly being made to feel stupid,\nthey are stressing you out and preventing you from enjoying life up to a point where you can listen to Audio Books and Lectures.\nThis place is standing between you and knowledge,\nand calling you stupid while its at it.\n\nThis is why you can't drop out,\nbecause if this continues the world will fall apart.\n\nYour real study,\nbegins right now.\nYou have to figure out,\nhow this place works.\nWho the teachers answer to,\nwho the principals answer to.\nHow are they getting paid,\nfor this s*it.\nYou have to understand the school system,\nbecause you are going to fix it.\nThere is a couple of teachers,\nand a handful of students that will help you.\nLearn from the internet how to give speeches,\nand begin preparing yourself for speaking out against fake education.\n\nForgive the memorizes, they are often under as much pressure as the bullies are,\nthey are just better at keeping their mind from fracturing.\nSome of them maybe admiring you,\nthat you are so strong that you don't pretend to learn.\nIf one of the girls tries to talk to you,\ndon't freak out just say the truth:\n\"I am shy, I need some time to be able to speak with you,\nif you help me, I'll be your friend.\"\nand then add,\n\"I am going to try to fix school, I'll need a lot of help.\"\nAnd everything will work out.\n\nMy Friend,\nA school that pretends to teach,\nis a school that robs you of knowledge.\nCivilizations do not die with a bang,\nit happens so slowly that nobody notices when all the trees are gone.\nHow many Tigers are left in your time?\nI hope you still have a few, I had 4,000 when I wrote this.\nThe Nuclear superpowers,\nchose Mutually Assured Destruction, over Disarmament.\nAnd prisons were full of people who were warped,\nby stress, poverty, and lack of Knowledge,\nit was Ten Million at the time of writing.\nThe blindness starts in school,\nwhen Knowledge is replaced with disconnected facts and memorization.\nAnd it continues,\ngrow strong my friend,\nspeak Wisely, Nobly and Loudly.\nImagine what it will be like when it is all over, and schools begin working.\nEvery formula animated before student's eyes, paid internships all around the word,\nstudent exchange will be the first and foremost, adventures in England, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and why not.\nStudent Stipend will grant the students years of Enlightenment and Adventure,\nthe only grade will be their own path of education from Middle-school to University,\nall their curiosities combined together into a Hard Cover book,\nthat others may follow and improve upon in a Fellowship of Enlightenment.\nBegin your journey with A Short History of Nearly Everything, by Bill Bryson,\nleap to A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn,\nfor light reading try What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe,\nsee if you can find a copy of The Giants of Philosophy Series read by Charlton Heston,\nand look into The Teaching Company Lectures.\nTo make money, find a Start-up Accelerator similar to YCombinator near you,\nand begin building Virtual Schools Online, borrow from Massively multiplayer online games.\nPlease don't be alone, but even if you do end up trying to save the world alone,\nyou will be in company of great beings, my Friend, and the future generations will stand upon your shoulders.\n\nHere are some Starting Points, Thinkers and Scientists to get you started.\nBen Orlin \"When Memorization Gets in the Way of Learning\" The Atlantic, September 9, 2013[4]\n.\nDe-Grading Education by Elizabeth

  <p>The better the flow,<br>the easier the lessons go.</p>
  <p>Forced education - what a curse,<br>there is nothing worse.</p>
  <p>On the other hand,<br>learning and having fun is grand.</p>
  <p>When you are having fun,<br>learning is instantly done.</p>
  <p>You don't have to memorize anything,<br>you'll soon start squirting ideas like a wellspring.</p>
  <p>We can't learn in school under threat,<br>there is simply nothing to get.</p>
  <p>We are dreamers and inventors powered by joy,<br>school seem like a of ploy.</p>
  <p>I don't know what is happening,<br>being a real teacher is such beautiful thing.</p>
  <p>Until school starts teaching you for real,<br>and gets rid of grades - no deal.</p>
  <p>Learn on your own first,<br>without real education you'll be cursed.</p>

  <p>It is very easy to get going,<br>as all the fun is in knowing.</p>
  <p>Learn how to use leading Open Source programs,<br>and use lmms and <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Part">P5.js Audio</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3vVWry1zE">make some awesome jams</a>.</p>
  <p>Learning is nothing like what we see in school,<br>it is more like reinventing art, science and every tool.</p>
  <p>Failing at something or making a mess,<br>is just as precious as progress.</p>
  <p>Having fun while learning,<br>will have you keep returning.</p>
  <p>Reading and listening to biographies and books,<br>will help you see all the crooks.</p>

  <p>Feeling joy and having fun,<br>will also saturate everything you've done.</p>
  <p>Because your heart is smiling,<br>as you are sculpting, painting, composing or compiling....</p>
  <p>The content of your works will be funny,<br>and will make every day sunny.</p>
  <p>We all have great thirst for understanding,<br>and our minds have no limits as they are ever expanding.</p>
  <p>Self education, as in putting real education first,<br>was what helped Newton, Bruno, and Leonardo to quench their thirst.</p>
  <p>And they were all having fun,<br>it is how they became as brilliant as the sun.</p>
  <p>Let your joy flow into your work,<br>give each and every one of your works a funny quirk.</p>

  <p>Put a lemur in an awkward place,<br>use it to mark your style or space.</p>
  <p>Or use only one shape in all your art<br>like Yayoi Kusama who is extremely smart.</p>
  <p>Or focus just on one area of mathematics,<br>and let it grow, with utterly useless robotics.</p>
  <p>Never let go of having fun,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iC3Lh6XaOc">people will soon stand in awe of even the tiny things you have done</a>.</p>
  <p>Fun will keep you reinventing, revisiting, and returning,<br>and that is what it means to be truly learning.</p>
  <p>A real education is begotten with ones own heart,<br>not by pretending that memorization makes us smart.</p>

  <p>Your mind is one of a kind,<br>and your unique constellation is perfectly aligned.</p>
  <p>All the areas of your fun will eventually connect,<br>and all your creations will begin approaching perfect.</p>
  <p>But you have to feel joy, and have fun,<br>you have to allow the energies of your life to run.</p>
  <p>The world needs your original, unique, or funny creations,<br>if you put joy in it you will be remembered for many generations.</p>

  <p>I worry that my first poem is not enough to announce that gateways to art,<br>have opened to all now - there are no more barriers left.</p>

  <p>Maybe, probably,<br>it is the first thing everybody learns at the Art Academy - but they don't seem to share.</p>
  <p>This isn't really tracing,<br>this is not color by number either.</p>
  <p>This is something different,<br>it is a way to improve art.</p>
  <p>It is away to bring everyone,<br>into art.</p>

  <p>And it is a launchpad,<br>and an amazing teacher.</p>
  <p>I couldn't even list the things,<br>I've learned in the past two days.</p>

  <p>Could this have been a secret,<br>that nobody wanted to talk about.</p>
  <p>Artist do tell each other that copying,<br>is not art - and what an awful and toxic thing to say that is.</p>

  <p>Use the reference Images Tool,<br>to place your source photo over the entire canvas.</p>
  <p>Set the source photo opacity to one percent,<br>now your color picker will only ever return colors from the invisible reference image.</p>
  <p>This is the Color Picker,<br>in God Mode.</p>
  <p>Everyone,<br>is an artist now.</p>

  <p>I know art is a billion things,<br>and that tracing is in fact art, and an expression of respect.</p>
  <p>I know there are nincompoops out there,<br>that will say it is not art.</p>
  <p>Maybe we should just tell them,<br>that their portraits are slightly crooked.</p>
  <p>Alas, art is about sending a message,<br>and pointing at thing and calling it "not art", sends the wrong one.</p>

  <p>This technique of always having the correct color<br>in the precise area of the canvas your brush is in.</p>
  <p>Means that you can paint photo realistic portraits,<br>you still choose the brush, or when you actually need the new color.</p>
  <p>You still take the portrait photo,<br>you still have to pay attention to the way the face is lit up by the sun.</p>
  <p>And you can make a caricature,<br>by using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etkvjiiGs1c">GIMP's warp transform</a>.</p>
  <p>And other customization and arrangements,<br>along the way.</p>
  <p>But there is no barrier here,<br>art is open to you now.</p>
  <p>You are,<br>an artist.</p>

  <p>It is too easy to underestimate the significance of color being a click away,<br>relatively speaking transferring proportions or outlines is child's play.</p>
  <p>Wrong proportions are easy to spot, and show first,<br>but it is the color that makes art beautiful.</p>
  <p>In realistic portraits,<br>color is critical.</p>
  <p>"You are an artist" is all I can say in hopes of explaining<br>how important that invisible layer of color is.</p>
  <p>The barrier to enter art,<br>is gone.</p>
  <p>Once you paint your first digital painting,<br>the gateway of adding everything else is wide open.</p>
  <p>Everything will call to you, enhanced realism with perfect eyes and faces radiating with sunshine,<br>backgrounds with fantastic creatures and universes, caricatures and lowbrow.</p>
  <p>An unlike color and proportions,<br>these enhancements are all friendly and full of joy, and extremely rewarding.</p>
  <p>The only other thing I can say,<br>is that your paintings will look so real, people will have trouble believing it is not some clever trick.</p>
  <p>And that will serve as an invitation,<br>to teach them, to show them that gateways to great art are open now.</p>
  <p>You are,<br>an artist.</p>

High School was supposed to teach you how to build your own company,
and you were supposed to figure out that College is just a scam.
You were not supposed to tolerate fake grades,
and even grades in general.
The system of encouragement was supposed to revolve around your financial independence,
your teachers were supposed to teach you how to build a series of independent businesses.

It is that series of businesses,
that would create the need for Mathematics, Programming, and Science.
Language, Social Studies, History, would come from narrated books,
that you would read in your travels as an exchange student.
The exchange is meant to help you transition to a broader more global culture,
in expectation of world peace and unity.

Electives, are actually just as important,
if not more important as the main subjects.
Your school was never supposed to use grades,
but both get you to make money and pay for a healthy and balanced existence.

This is not a fantasy,
military, nuclear weapons, and war as means of change are the fantasy.
Just consider how imbecile and infantile Peace is,
by means of using Mutually Assured Destruction as a deterrent.
How many generations will it take do you think,
before the notion of a deterrent is forgotten, and they are deployed.
Deployed by uneducated children,
taught from a young age that other children need to die because they are different.
Even borders are a stupid idea,
geographic - certainly - but any division that drives our family apart is a stupid idea.
A functional education system,
that immediately helps its students out of poverty is critical for the advancement of human kind.

You have been mislead[1],
you have been tricked[2].
You have been forced into broken cultures,
and you have been put on a path to repeat humanity’s worst mistakes.

The people who have done this to you,
are the same people who will do this to the younger generations.
To stop this, to put an end to this cycle,
you have to stop living an ordinary life and become a great being.
If you don’t stop living an ordinary life,
right now.
Then whatever discomforts you are hoping to avoid by continuing to live life as is,
will transform into untold suffering[3] for the generations.
Future generations,
that you are meant to watch over with your Greatness of Heart and Mind.

Here is how you can get started:
Listen to every narrated book that changes lives,
if your boss wants you to stop learning during work, quit your job and find one that will support your education.
The reason why you can’t see what you will do about money,
is the same reason why people who have been taken into slavery didn’t know where else to go.
It is the same reason why people return to prisons,
being unable to find a job, or an apartment even.
Knowledge was denied to them,
knowledge has been denied to you as well.
Other than telling you to listen and read thousands of books,
I won't tell you which.
Because it is the hundreds of great beings that you choose_ to listen to,
that will help you find a path of real knowledge, true wisdom, and unforgettable greatness.
A word of caution, those who will try to prevent you from listening to books,
or make fun of you for any such reason, are neither friend nor family.

Go to the library, search for narrated books that try to bridge what we didn’t learn in school,
with what we should know today.
Pleasant and award winning books,
with cheerful authors and memorable narrators.
Look into non-fiction,
Biographies and Memoirs, Adventure and Travel.
There is no single category that will have everything you need,
but look into meaningful lives and admired thinkers that made the world a better place.
Look for adventure books,
that make us stronger.

Narrated books also double as a way of testing your well being,
if you can’t focus, or keep losing track especially when you have a good narrator - then you have pushed yourself too hard in life.
It is not that you can’t listen to narrated books,
but that you have been pushed too far and cut your self off from the ability to learn and listen.
Vacations ,
often reveal the stress levels that we are under.
After some real rest,
you will discover that you need books.

If you need a vacation,
but aren’t sure what to do, or where to go.
There are places that many Great Beings upon visitation many call a Crucible, a Place Of Healing, and even Penance.
Those are the Great Trails,
The Appalachian Trail of the East[4], and the Pacific Crest Trail of the West[5], and they have their equivalents throughout the world.
They will always wait for you,
they will always welcome you.
They will always heal you,
and they will always serve as all the proof you need, that you are meant to become a Great Being; and add to the change the future needs.
Simon & Garfunkel El Cóndor Pasa[6]

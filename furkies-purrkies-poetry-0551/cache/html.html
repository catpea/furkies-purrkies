  <p>High School was supposed to teach you how to build your own company,<br>and you were supposed to figure out that College is just a scam.</p>
  <p>You were not supposed to tolerate fake grades,<br>and even grades in general.</p>
  <p>The system of encouragement was supposed to revolve around your financial independence,<br>your teachers were supposed to teach you how to build a series of independent businesses.</p>

  <p>It is that series of businesses,<br>that would create the need for Mathematics, Programming, and Science.</p>
  <p>Language, Social Studies, History, would come from narrated books,<br>that you would read in your travels as an exchange student.</p>
  <p>The exchange is meant to help you transition to a broader more global culture,<br>in expectation of world peace and unity.</p>

  <p>Your school was never supposed to use grades,<br>but both get you to make money and pay for a healthy and balanced existence.</p>

  <p>This is not a fantasy,<br>military, nuclear weapons, and war as means of change are the fantasy.</p>
  <p>Just consider how imbecile and infantile Peace <strong>is</strong>,<br>by means of using Mutually Assured Destruction as a deterrent.</p>
  <p>How many generations will it take do you think,<br>before the notion of a deterrent is forgotten, and they are deployed.</p>
  <p>Deployed by uneducated children,<br>taught from a young age that other children need to die because they are different.</p>
  <p>Even borders are a stupid idea,<br>geographic - certainly - but any division that drives our family apart is a stupid idea.</p>
  <p>A functional education system,<br>that immediately helps its students out of poverty is critical for the advancement of human kind.</p>

  <p>The people who have done this to you,<br>are the same people who will do this to the younger generations.</p>
  <p>To stop this, to put an end to this cycle,<br>you have to stop living an ordinary life and become a great being.</p>
  <p>If you don’t stop living an ordinary life,<br>right now.</p>
  <p>Then whatever discomforts you are hoping to avoid by continuing to live life as is,<br>will transform into <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/05/world/climate-emergency-scientists-warning-intl-trnd/index.html">untold suffering</a> for the generations.</p>

  <p>Here is how you can get started:</p>
  <p>Listen to every narrated book that changes lives,<br>if your boss wants you to stop learning during work, quit your job and find one that will support your education.</p>
  <p>The reason why you can’t see what you will do about money,<br>is the same reason why people who have been taken into slavery didn’t know where else to go.</p>
  <p>It is the same reason why people return to prisons,<br>being unable to find a job, or an apartment even.</p>
  <p>Knowledge was denied to them,<br>knowledge has been denied to you as well.</p>
  <p>Other than telling you to listen and read thousands of books,<br>I won't tell you which.</p>
  <p>Because it is the hundreds of great beings that <strong>you choose</strong>_ to listen to,<br>that will help you find a path of real knowledge, true wisdom, and unforgettable greatness.</p>
  <p>A word of caution, those who will try to prevent you from listening to books,<br>or make fun of you for any such reason, are neither friend nor family.</p>

  <p>Go to the library, search for narrated books that try to bridge what we didn’t learn in school,<br>with what we should know today.</p>
  <p>Pleasant and award winning books,<br>with cheerful authors and memorable narrators.</p>
  <p>Look into non-fiction,<br>Biographies and Memoirs, Adventure and Travel.</p>
  <p>There is no single category that will have everything you need,<br>but look into meaningful lives and admired thinkers that made the world a better place.</p>
  <p>Look for adventure books,<br>that make us stronger.</p>

  <p>Narrated books also double as a way of testing your well being,<br>if you can’t focus, or keep losing track especially when you have a good narrator - then you have pushed yourself too hard in life.</p>
  <p>It is not that you can’t listen to narrated books,<br>but that you have been pushed too far and cut your self off from the ability to learn and listen.</p>
  <p>Vacations ,<br>often reveal the stress levels that we are under.</p>
  <p>After some real rest,<br>you will discover that you need books.</p>

  <p>If you need a vacation,<br>but aren’t sure what to do, or where to go.</p>
  <p>There are places that many Great Beings upon visitation many call a Crucible, a Place Of Healing, and even Penance.</p>
  <p>Those are the Great Trails,<br>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Appalachian Trail of the East</a>, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmmH-2rWHH0">Pacific Crest Trail of the West</a>, and they have their equivalents throughout the world.</p>
  <p>They will always wait for you,<br>they will always welcome you.</p>
  <p>They will always heal you,<br>and they will always serve as all the proof you need, that you are meant to become a Great Being; and add to the change the future needs.</p>

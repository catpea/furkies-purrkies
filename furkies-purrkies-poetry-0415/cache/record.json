  "text": "Unfortunately :)\nYou don't have to tell anyone about it,\njust do it on the side to relax, without taking it too seriously.\nBuy yourself a beautiful keyboard,\nmaybe a mechanical keyboard with funny keys.\nAnd get the 8GB Raspberry PI CanaKit for $150,\nand one or two $90 monitors.\nInstall node.js[1],\nmaybe install xscreensaver, and turn on the XMatrix screensaver.\nAnd take a break, set it up all nice and beautiful...\nand let the damn thing haunt you from the corner of your house.\n\nThe programming language you will be learning is JavaScript,\nit is the most popular programming language, it will be here for many decades.\nAnd the first thing it to create your hello-world.js,\nthat just contains console.log('Hello World!');\nThen, make it executable with chmod +x hello-world.js;\nand watch it print Hello World, in your Linux terminal.\nIn terms of knowledge, this will be more powerful,\nthan your entire high-school education.\n\nHello World,\nthat is your foot into programming.\nGrad a book, about programming JavaScript,\nor programming node, and learn about functions(){} and for() loops.\nAnd type up some example code,\njust relax.\n\nLater, you will need to get used to github,\nthe web is full of github tutorials[2].\nGithub represents your resume,\nyou want to have between a hundred and a thousand programs.\nThey all have to be little,\nlittle gems, like you can find on microjs.com[3]\n\nMake sure to create a test.js with every one of your programs,\nso that you can throw a bunch of stuff at your program to see if everything works.\nAnd use the type: 'module' in your package.json[4],\nthis way you can use the modern JavaScript imports, instead of require statements.\nAnd again keep it all small,\nsmall and perfect.\n\nYou can create servers,\nthat you can explore with your browser.\nYou can create command line utilities,\nthat you can publish to npm[5], and then install on any computer with node.\nThe whole npm thing is just a directory of public programs and libraries[6],\nit goes really well with github, especially when it comes to quality of your resume.\nTry to create text games, wikis, little Linux programs that help you analyze text,\nspend some time using different APIs to automate YouTube or make your toaster Tweet nonsense.\n\nIt is all just fun,\nit is really cool.\nOnce you have a lot of programs, maybe just 30, 100 maybe too much, and 1,000 is just weird,\nthen view your github as your resume.\nIt won't take too much more to get a job as a programmer,\nmaybe some certification, though only if you like that kind of thing.\nIt is really fun to take classes about thing that you have already mastered,\nit is very relaxing.\nThen brush up on weird parts of JavaScript by looking at,\nJavaScript interview questions[7].\nAnd then, people will start paying you for playing with computers,\nit is an amazing experience.\nJust you know keep it short,\nyou will have to build your own company, you can't just work for somebody else.\nAnd then change the world,\neverything that you will do here, from your first cool keyboard onward, will reinforce your unique mind.\n\nLearning programming, is a very narrow and straight road,\nday after day, you just continuously increase in power.\nThere are no forks in the road,\nno stupid test, and the knowledge you internalize is always appreciated.\nFinally, your elder self will never seriously say,\n\"Oh, my gosh lyke, why am I a programmer? - what the hell was I thinking?\"\nYou'll say it plenty of times as a cheerful joke though,\nprogramming is really cool, even if you just do it for fun, it is like the ultimate form of meditation and entertainment.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izOhCUdLv2s\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo\n[3]: http://microjs.com/\n[4]: https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_type\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHDhaSSKmB0\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Rmj5UY5mJk\n[7]: https://github.com/DopplerHQ/awesome-interview-questions#javascript",

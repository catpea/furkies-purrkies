  "text": "We face many problems,\nthat unfortunately can't be fixed.\nWe can't bring back tigers after they are gone,\nwe can't do anything after a Nuclear War.\nWe can't remove corruption from politics,\nbecause it permeates it, because it is politics.\nWhile these problems have no solutions,\nthere is something gentle, wise and wonderful that can be done.\n\nThe irreparable can be prevented from occurring,\nthe events leading up to disasters can be collapsed.\n\nThere are two powerful measures that people of the world must institute,\nReal Schools, and A Poverty Ending Bank.\n\nThe bank does not make a person rich,\nthe money is only meant for food and savings.\n$100 dollars per day in 2020 money,\nconstantly adjusted for inflation.\nThere are ways to ensure one card per person,\nbut card fraud does not matter, only that we take care of the poor matters.\nYou send in a piece of paper, even if you can't write, a squiggle will do,\nyou get a card with your mark back.\nCard is reset to $100 at Midnight Greenwich Mean Time,\neveryone gets to eat, and set money aside for rent.\nAll humans beings will be approved,\nno exceptions.\nThe bank is a simple computer program,\nit does not track debt past 24 hours, it just resets the cards to $100 dollars at Midnight GMT.\nIt is just an international institution,\nit is not part of any country in particular.\n\nCritics, please understand,\nand understand for what you stand for.\nI leave it up to Philosophers to plow the depths of this crime,\nand bring light to the misery we all spread by accepting Poverty as part of life.\n\nSchools have never worked,\nany and all the success that was had came from well educated parents, tutors, well to do families, generational wealth, and luck.\nThe year is 2022,\nand we still don't have schools.\nThere is a handful of educational institutions that function under the disuse of serving the gifted,\nthey may in fact function, but the idea is to charge more for special kind of education.\nIn that way,\nall our educational institutions engage in fraud.\n\nMuch like the international bank,\nan international school, independent of any nation is needed.\nIt will produce a program much like MediaWiki that powers WikiPedia,\nbut it will function as a game where users must solve puzzled to open doors to the next room.\nThe first room is called the Lobby,\nand here students choose a door that interests them.\nThe subjects are nothing like what we see in standardized education,\nthey are far more encompassing and include a little bit of everything.\nI will provide a short list at the end of the letter,\nbut to give an example, Adventurer, Humanitarian, Hacker, Security Analyst.\nThese are not subjects, they encompass partial snippets of what we teach in school today,\nand as the student progresses through they gain a full picture of science, mathematics, art, music, but in a context that is relevant to them.\nThis school encourages the use of tutors, almost always student tutors,\nit does not have teachers, the school is the teacher.\nIt uses very simple technologies,\nso that program can run on inexpensive low powered hardware.\nThere will be many instances of these servers,\nand they will constantly update to newer versions as those come in reach.\nSome nations choose to obscure historical facts,\nthis is not a long term solution, their attempts at tampering with their copy of data are to be made known, but ignored.\nThe first students will be those equipped with computers and cell phones,\nand one of the most prestigious challenges they face, is to keep translations up-to-date, and provide nations devastated by poverty with solar power and audio versions of the school.\nThere is no graduation, the students are rewarded for life long learning\nand long term contributions in the form of new resources, paths and rooms.\nWith student permission on case by case basis, potential employers can request to see the path or mesh the student has traveled,\nand thus find students with the exact skills required.\n\nThe World is being held hostage by Poverty and Lack of Education,\nit is hard to see at first, because we tend to accept the world we are born into.\nWe tend to listen to our guardians that accepted the world they were born into,\nin that way we are are all Blind.\nThe Schools and the Bank,\nchange the way things are.\nAnd the new Students will become Stronger and Wiser than us,\nwe will all be gone by the time they take to reshaping their future generations.\nBut our contributions will be permanent,\nthe first large deliberate stepping stone aimed at the advancement of human kind.\nThe School and the Bank will erase all the confusing problems of today,\nan educated world that does not punish it self with poverty is a simpler world.\nYou and I have grew up and lived in cities that were programmed into Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles armed with Nuclear Warheads,\nwe've beet taught to warship the imaginary, to honor the corrupt and the cheaters, and to label things with ugly words and throw them away.\nWe labeled and threw away people into mental institutions and prisons,\nwithout ever trying to prevent poverty from fracturing their minds.\nWe are taught to label life giving things as Communism or Socialism, or Conspiracy,\nand to quickly throw them away, as if to prevent our corrupt politicians for feeling shame for us, that we would do such a thing as to hang on to them.\n\nOur minds are not in the right place,\nwe have been mislead for far too long.\nBut all it takes to see that school is not working,\nis looking back at our experiences in high school.\nAnd all it takes to see that we are wage slaves,\nis to imagine a life with a $100 per day card.\nI know it is a bit scary, but just consider what you have given up of your self,\nfor this stupid idea that we are all meant to be poor, that this is how things are meant to be, for reasons too complex for our simple minds to grasp.\n\nHelp your children understand that their poverty is neither your or their fault,\nthat it is a mistake that humanity has made while growing up.\nWith each

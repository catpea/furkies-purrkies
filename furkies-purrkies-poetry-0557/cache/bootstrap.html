    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The biggest problem is the content, structure and aim of lectures,<br>that is where the really real results are.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If the lectures themselves are broken,<br>then increasing teacher performance is of little consequence.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Humanity has invented the concept of money and put all of the world into poverty,<br>if we want students to learn for real, we have to help them towards financial independence.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here, the students will learn how to build small companies first,<br>they will be expected to run several, and graduate when they begin supporting themselves.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is not a money school, not a business school, or start-up incubator,<br>this is an educational strategy that creates a reason for going to school.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And a reason for learning programming, or soldering, or 3D modeling, or even marketing,<br>which will create a very real and powerful need, for mathematics, physics, chemistry, language, literature, etc.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Math poses such a challenge, because it is not a subject,<br>it is a collection of tools and observations that should not be taught without a need.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Forcing a student to memorize mathematics,<br>without context or desire for it is a mistake, to say the least.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Math can be easily taught with just two simple things,<br>a through list of mathematical topics along with an explanation for what they are useful for, and something that is interesting to the student, that will create a need for these topics.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Interesting things that can teach math are Computer Games, Programmatic 3D Modeling, Generative Art, Screensavers, Sound Synthesis, Programming Robots, Programming Drones, and programming Drones for race or battle in the air.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHk5PEZAyMA">Drones can be made in the classroom</a>, this would create a need for knowledge of electronics, and minor programming.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I repeat, teaching subjects without a need for them,<br>is a mistake.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Similarly, Physics, although much more practical than Math,<br>is still not meant to be approached without a real need.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Note that hose who enjoy the study of physics will find it easier to learn math from within-physics by reinventing calculus or strange attractors,<br>this is an example of approaching math indirectly, as a library of useful things.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There are countless ways to make physics interesting to students,<br>for example, due to the ease with which we learn to compose music, sound synthesizers make for a great introduction.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Perhaps the best introduction, is to get the students to build an array of radio telescopes,<br>and begin listening to the skies.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Satellites, radio bursts, strange anomalies, perhaps participation in SETI, and certainly radio communication, will invite great many students.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Other ideas are working with inexpensive SBCâ€™s like the Raspberry PI, and building 3D printers from scratch, making custom digital cameras.</div>

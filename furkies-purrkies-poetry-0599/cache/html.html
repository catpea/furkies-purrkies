  <p>Teachers...</p>
  <p>A negative grade,<br>does not provide aid.</p>
  <p>It does not motivate,<br>it prevents them from becoming great.</p>
  <p>Far too many teachers have confused students' intelligence,<br>with their own blind negligence.</p>
  <p>They say, students are getting dumber each generation,<br>but it was their task to provide the correct foundation.</p>

  <p>Students...</p>
  <p>Tell the teachers your minds are not for sale,<br>and let the teachers fail.</p>
  <p>Fill the auditorium, the lunchroom and the library,<br>and learn, because life without real education will get scary.</p>
  <p>Fight to learn to build small companies tooth and nail,<br>and fill them with products for sale.</p>
  <p>The philosophers are not warped or crazy,<br>it was that the teachers were always too lazy.</p>
  <p>Socrates should mark the beginning of your quest,<br>listen to every philosopher all they way up to Cornel West.</p>
  <p>Build a memory palace or maybe a cathedral, or a city even,<br>built something you can trust and believe in.</p>
  <p>Build in sequence that history dictates,<br>this will help you remember all the Philosophers and True Saints.</p>
  <p>Never again trust others with the content of your character and mind,<br>precisely because of every one of those paychecks that they signed.</p>

  <p>We need to be done with the old,<br>we need to stop doing what we are told.</p>
  <p>It is time to take to wisdom and think,<br>this world is not yours as you are but a chain link.</p>
  <p>You are an important connection to the future,<br>not a temporary means for some moocher.</p>
  <p>You were meant to be protectors of all the living creatures,<br>but you got sold out, by the teachers.</p>

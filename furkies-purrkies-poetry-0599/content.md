The last thing the world needs is more insults,
but Teachers need to pay attention to results.

Teachers...

A negative grade,
does not provide aid.

It does not motivate,
it prevents them from becoming great.

Far too many teachers have confused students' intelligence,
with their own blind negligence.

They say, students are getting dumber each generation,
but it was their task to provide the correct foundation.

No more hunger, no more fear,
Human Life, is far too dear.

Students...

Tell the teachers your minds are not for sale,
and let the teachers fail.

Fill the auditorium, the lunchroom and the library,
and learn, because life without real education will get scary.

Fight to learn to build small companies tooth and nail,
and fill them with products for sale.

The philosophers are not warped or crazy,
it was that the teachers were always too lazy.

Socrates should mark the beginning of your quest,
listen to every philosopher all they way up to Cornel West.

Build a memory palace or maybe a cathedral, or a city even,
built something you can trust and believe in.

Build in sequence that history dictates,
this will help you remember all the Philosophers and True Saints.

Never again trust others with the content of your character and mind,
precisely because of every one of those paychecks that they signed.

No more hunger, no more fear,
Human Life, is far too dear.

And people of the world...

We need to be done with the old,
we need to stop doing what we are told.

It is time to take to wisdom and think,
this world is not yours as you are but a chain link.

You are an important connection to the future,
not a temporary means for some moocher.

You were meant to be protectors of all the living creatures,
but you got sold out, by the teachers.

---

No more hunger, no more fear,
Human Life, is far too dear.

---

Yes, repeated mistakes show you forgot much,
but you have to regain that touch.

There is no one listening to you above,
you are to gift the future generations with unconditional respect and love.

It was the future that listened to your thoughts all along,
they hear everything and always forgive you for being wrong.

But they need you to get up each and every time,
they don't want a future filled with collapsing ecosystems and crime.

They need you to become wise,
so that politics and ecosystems have a hope to stabilize.

---

If they could transport a message back to us,
it would just say "Become Wise".

---

This is not our first rodeo, folks,
and climate change is not a hoax.

We need to end poverty, prisons, and wars,
we have to relax borders and open doors.

Hating or being scared of our family is a sickness,
that a wise nation will erase with great quickness.

---

War is never the solution,
and it invalidates every participating institution.

We need to get the people out of the warring nation,
the entire peaceful world needs to help with the migration.
---

No more hunger, no more fear,
Human Life, is far too dear.

Remember, all the people with eyes you do not recognize,
are just your sons and daughters in disguise.

The division,
is made out of lack of vision.

The people of the world,
need to help the children before they become too old.

Prevention! It is best to prevent division,
and only wisdom can provide the needed cohesion.

No more hunger, no more fear,
Human Life, is far too dear.

  <p>Avoid complete pre-packaged answers that are often provided in college,<br>and assemble countless tools for thinking to fuel a factory of your knowledge.</p>
  <p>And don't search for a list of tools for thinking as we can't learn them that way,<br>simply listen or read about lifetimes how they unfold and play.</p>
  <p>The living evolving wisdom we hold in our mind is a form of art,<br>lists and memorization only make one temporarily look smart.</p>

  <p>Love of wisdom helps us see far,<br>and it does not matter where or who we are.</p>
  <p>Pick the books that call to you and make the stories align,<br>your own path is something that <strong>you</strong> have to design.</p>
  <p>Being given a list of books,<br>is a sign that you are being cheated by crooks.</p>

  <p>Becoming wise is marked by,<br>by the ability to synthesize.</p>
  <p>It is when there are so many thoughts on your mind,<br>that many of them become automatically aligned.</p>
  <p>To be wise and full of ideas and freely think,<br>is to have the content of our character to interlink.</p>

  <p>This is hard to do if we don't listen to or read real books,<br>as the world is a bit more complex than it looks.</p>

  <p>We need constant motion towards wisdom and liberty,<br>the world must not be held back by poverty.</p>

  <p>You simply have to pick the books that call to you,<br>that pleasantly expand your world view.</p>

  <p>You need a connection to some area or subject,<br>something that your mind clicks with and does not reject.</p>

  <p>We just can't be told what to read or learn next,<br>even if we temporarily memorize in our mind can still reject the whole text.</p>

  <p>Knowledge full of contradictions is not useful,<br>navigating life with it can be harmful.</p>

  <p>Blender is a program for making 3D things,<br>3D game characters, and everything else.</p>
  <p>The way things are done in the 3D world,<br>is that you start with a 3D primitive like a cube or a sphere.</p>
  <p>And then you apply modifications,<br>for example you can extrude faces of a cube with your mouse.</p>
  <p>Or you can apply an automatic modifier,<br>such as solidify.</p>
  <p>Which for an unknown reason,<br>will go inside your cube, and make a little home.</p>
  <p>It will give the inside of a cube, walls,<br>perhaps it sees the faces of a solid cube as a thing to solidify.</p>
  <p>You can mix and match modifiers,<br>you can send a solidified cube into some other modifier.</p>
  <p>As a side note, nobody yet knows,<br>what happens when you solidify a solidified cube - you get a second floor maybe.</p>
  <p>There is maybe 50 modifiers that do odd,<br>but useful things like that.</p>
  <p>And then there is this really crazy one,<br>called Geometry Nodes.</p>
  <p>When you select your cube,<br>and apply a geometry node modifier.</p>
  <p>You get to see this beam of geometric information,<br>flowing from the input of the modifier to the output.</p>
  <p>These beams or node connections, or node trees,<br>or geometry node blocks are not a new idea.</p>
  <p>It is a drag and drop programming language,<br>not quite a proper user interface, and not a boring old programming language.</p>
  <p>It is like a subway map,<br>you can follow the connections, to get a good picture of where things are happening.</p>
  <p>Hollywood uses a similar language for advanced computer based scenes,<br>and previously Blender used something similar to color 3D objects.</p>
  <p>A language called pure data allows for music creation,<br>and a program called node red can help you program web servers.</p>

  <p>To return to our cube with,<br>a geometry nodes modifier.</p>
  <p>If you cut the stream of the geometric information,<br>inside your Geometry nodes Modifier, the cube simply disappears.</p>
  <p>That input no longer reaches the output, the geometric information is cut,<br>and it won’t reach your screen.</p>
  <p>Here in this visual programming language,<br>you can also modify geometry.</p>
  <p>But you don’t get something for nothing,<br>like with the solidify modifier.</p>
  <p>Now you have to really sit down,<br>with a pencil, and try to figure things out.</p>

  <p>This is where this poem,<br>becomes a little bit unhinged, so better grab onto something.</p>
  <p>This sub modifier world,<br>this world of sub primitive things.</p>
  <p>Does not aim to speak the human language,<br>it won’t try to say solidify.</p>
  <p>Where you can sort of kind of hope to try, to imagine,<br>that something is about to become solid, somehow.</p>
  <p>Here if you want to do something,<br>you have to look at other people doing stuff, and remember it.</p>
  <p>You may have to read documentation,<br>which will for example seem to try to help you.</p>
  <p>For one it will break down long pages into section,<br>and sure as heck, they will start with a title, that someone careful highlighted, and made bold.</p>
  <p>But often just to mock you, to try to break you,<br>to try to make the documentation writers look special.</p>
  <p>But after a while,<br>you will be able to do stuff.</p>
  <p>You can make your own solidify thingine, sort of,<br>if you take a cube, and and add a delete geometry node, and set it to delete faces.</p>
  <p>And then convert the resulting lines into a curve,<br>which is more important than a line, and has a whole lot of tools.</p>
  <p>Then you will find yourself, with a new starting point,<br>and lots of little tools for curve operations.</p>
  <p>And here you can dress-up your curve (that was once a cube without faces),<br>with another curve, which will gently trace all the lines, and thus solidify your main curve.</p>
  <p>And I did just that to create the decoration for a ring,<br>except that instead of a cube I used a low resolution sphere.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>So you see, there is functionality in here,<br>but you have to know to delete some geometry.</p>
  <p>And you have to remember that curves,<br>are treated with extra care and respect, and have lots of little functions.</p>
  <p>Such as dressing up one curve with another,<br>a process that I have repeated, to create the main body of the ring.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Here, the curve that I was using to dress up my ring or curve-circle,<br>is something I manually created with my mouse.</p>
  <p>I wanted total control over how the ring feels,<br>and I actually repeated this step one more time.</p>
  <p>So that I could fuse into the main body,<br>a much more geometric looking dress-up curve.</p>
  <p>This way the inside of the ring will be very smooth,<br>while the outside will have an interesting polygonal pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And finally I had to pause,<br>because when yo dress up a curve, it is a whole operation, all at once.</p>
  <p>But to position, the main decoration of the ring,<br>I only needed one spot.</p>
  <p>I didn’t want to slide around a ring, or dress up anything,<br>I just needed the correct coordinate on the top of this ring.</p>
  <p>Asking for top was too much,<br>I could have done it, but it would have added extra math.</p>
  <p>And it is a good idea to keep everything inside Geometry Nodes,<br>as simple as possible.</p>
  <p>For example, any addition to a ring,<br>is just about the size of a borough on a New York subway map.</p>
  <p>So by the time you add five non-trivial things,<br>your program looks like the NYC Subway Map.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And it turned out that I wouldn't get a coordinate for my ring decoration,<br>that is way too much to ask.</p>
  <p>You have to gently build up information as you work with your curves,<br>and by the way curves are so special because they are simple.</p>
  <p>A mesh such as that of a small smooth torus,<br>can have hundreds of thousands of vectors of geometric information.</p>
  <p>Where if you start with a curve circle,<br>you will have 10 units of information.</p>
  <p>In computer world everything starts at zero,<br>including bugs, called <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/fencepost-error.html">Fence Post Problems</a>.</p>
  <p>Because, when you start at zero,<br>your number of cats is two, but you actually have a third cat...</p>
  <p>Or possibly you only have one cat,<br>or four.... maybe.</p>
  <p>Anywho... zero is a really special number, because it is weird,<br>and in the beginning.</p>
  <p>So it is a really good spot,<br>to weld the decoration of a ring to.</p>
  <p>And in geometry nodes you would say,<br>convert a copy of my curve to points.</p>
  <p>Another useful tool, a point, is a reference point,<br>it has XYZ, but also a radius, and you can attach custom calculations to it as of the recent Blender 3.2</p>
  <p>So here, to place that decoration at spot zero,<br>wherever it may be.</p>
  <p>We say, distribute decorations to point,<br>and this will immediate do what we are trying to avoid.</p>
  <p>It will create as many copies of our decoration,<br>as there are points.</p>
  <p>Blender, and operations in-general are at their simplest when they are complete,<br>because you never have to wonder what you got, you got all of it.</p>
  <p>So now that the decoration has been distributed to all the points,<br>and we have the most uncomfortable ring int he world.</p>
  <p>We say, “Hey, distribute on point node”,<br>“I am going to select point zero”.</p>
  <p>Whenever something is doing all it can,<br>there is usually a section option.</p>
  <p>Which is a way of saying,<br>select only those part of a thing.</p>
  <p>So we select the part numbered zero by connecting boolean math node,<br>in the A filed we attach we attach INDEX, which holds index numbers of points.</p>
  <p>And then in the B field,<br>we enter our magical number zero.</p>
  <p>And now the decorations are no longer distributed around the ring,<br>they are just at the point with index zero.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But now it gets worse,<br>because you want to have smaller supporting decorations on each side.</p>
  <p>And you want them to grow smaller and smaller as they move away,<br>from the main decoration.</p>
  <p>There is no easy solution for this,<br>there is no trick you can pull of here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>Right after we converted our curve to reference points,<br>we have to start doing math, with the cheerful little chipper math geometry nodes.</p>
  <p>Which are the ultimate proof,<br>that math is fun and easy, when it is done right.</p>
  <p>Let us say we have ten reference points that we converted out cure into,<br>and no we will not call it N points, none of that nonsense.</p>
  <p>We need to take this ten,<br>and make the center special.</p>
  <p>Because that is where the smaller decorations,<br>will pop up and start getting even smaller.</p>
  <p>So to crack number 10 in half,<br>we have to position it over zero.</p>
  <p>And then just throw it down,<br>as if the zero was the top of a pyramid.</p>
  <p>So to pull it back on a number scale,<br>so that the middle of the ten numbers is over zero, or becomes zero.</p>
  <p>We need to know the half of ten,<br>and then subtract it from ten.</p>
  <p>So we are pulling the ten,<br>back into the minus world.</p>
  <p>Now our numbers go from -5 to +5.<br>and here things get really easy.</p>
  <p>Because we can just map -5 to +5,<br>with a map numbers node.</p>
  <p>This node will ask us, what is the minimum from,<br>what is the maximum from, and we enter -5 and 5.</p>
  <p>And then it asks what is the minimum to,<br>and maximum to, and here we say -1 to 1.</p>
  <p>This will create a series of 10 floating point numbers, doubles,<br>that are now squished between -1 and 1.</p>
  <p>And since we want things to be uniform on both sides of the ring,<br>we want to run the numbers through an absolute function - to get rid of that minus.</p>
  <p>There is an inversion that you have to perform here,<br>so that zeros become ones and ones become zeros.</p>
  <p>Because we didn’t start at zero, we started at one, what was once minus one,<br>and then went over to one.</p>
  <p>That means the zero that was the top of the pyramid,<br>is where index five is, not where index zero is, we want to keep the zeros together.</p>
  <p>Which in the world of rings means, at the beginning and at the end,<br>at index 0 and also at index 9.</p>
  <p>And here finally we assign this number to the radius,<br>of our 3D reference point for safe keeping.</p>
  <p>And now as we instantiate decorations on the surface of our ring,<br>we have all the information we need to have a center decoration.</p>
  <p>And side decorations,<br>that gently get smaller, and smaller, and smaller.</p>

  <p>What can I say,<br>if something is uniform like rings.</p>
  <p>Then it is almost certainly,<br>programmable.</p>
  <p>And with a little bit of patience,<br>a bunch of naps, and sunny days.</p>
  <p>You can create a generator of rings,<br>generator of all kinds of blings.</p>
  <p>The details on such a ring,<br>are almost too much for today’s technology.</p>

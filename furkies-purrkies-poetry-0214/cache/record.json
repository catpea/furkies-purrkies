class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">They already knew how to solve the problem of two users editing the same file at the same time,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the inspiration for that came from CouchDB.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In short, a unit of disk information in the first Cosmopolis was not a file,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it was a directory, with randomly named files prefixed with a version number.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">For example, detroit/15-aabbd.txt, detroit/15-xyxx.txt</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The brilliant thing about this is that when two people save version 15 at the same time,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the random name of the file decides which version 15 is used, via a simple alphanumeric sort.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If there are 32 people editing the same file, and they all click save at the same time,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and if some of the version 15 files arrive a second late because they have to travel across a slow network,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">by relying on blindly picking the topmost entry after an alphanumeric sort, once they get all the data,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">every participating server in the world will agree on the same version 15.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It should be noted that at this point the file will be flagged as having many conflicts,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and users will be called to take a look at the different version and manually pick and choose the good parts,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">this time everyone will be careful to just wait until the latest version is compiled.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So, they had a collaborative editing platform in less than 100 lines of code,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">basically a blank Wikipedia.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So now came the big question,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">which part of the universe do we create first to get that apple pie going?</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">They briefly considered to name the city Uruk,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">after the oldest city in the world, but settled on Night City instead.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And so it was, just like Wikipedia once had its first article,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">cosmopolis now held the first city: http://localhost:3000/view/night_city</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This was both exiting and terrifying, this program was meant to bring peace to the

<br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Adding user support had to come in next,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">just like every city had a page, so did every user.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Thus, Night City would receive its first two citizens,</div>\n  <span>Alice and Bob<sup>[3]</sup></span>.\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Out in the server

computer programs,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they were chatbots.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">However, the bots are separate programs that use Cosmopolis like a user would,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they would log in, check messages, scan for phrases they recognize and then perform some task within Cosmopolis.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The bots weren't really inspired by anything other than old <span>MUD<sup>[4]</sup></span> programs but there was a beautiful line of code,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that one of the leads always looked at, <span>line 26<sup>[5]</sup></span> in a sample script of github's hubot.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The bots were special,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they greatly simplified simulations and reasoning about this virtual test city.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">As a whole they already created a very simple,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but living simulation.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">For example one internal bot would be responsible for generating weather in Night City,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the bot actually got its information from Detroit's own weather service.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And our virtual Alice had a setting in her profile,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that would alert her when it was raining, she would then equip an umbrella before leaving for work.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Bots gave Cosmopolis that early life,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that made working on the system fun.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But by far the most special thing about bots,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">was that they could be replaced by a real human,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">by a person that would turn off the bot and log in into their account.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom:

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Even in the early tests, it was becoming more

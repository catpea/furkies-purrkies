  <p>There is of course but one rule in art:<br>Don't Stop.</p>
  <p>In deed, what makes an artist,<br>is frequent practice.</p>
  <p>That is all,<br>there is to it,</p>

  <p>Even so, what follows is a few thoughts I jotted this evening,<br>in anticipation of this poem.</p>

  <p>An easel, especially a portable one, meant for adventures,<br>can't be driven to the art destination.</p>
  <p>You can't just whip your easel out of the car,<br>and pop it up in front of some vista.</p>
  <p>It is hard to explain,<br>but you have to park somewhere far, down the hill.</p>
  <p>You can ride a bicycle, or huff an puff some other way,<br>but you can't use a car to get all the way.</p>
  <p>The practice of art,<br>requires great Dignity and Nobility.</p>

  <p>Long before you pounce at art,<br>take time to learn how and what time of day you can take good photos.</p>
  <p>Always take more photos than you will ever need,<br>you just never know the smiles you can discover in there.</p>
  <p>A photo is a magical connection to the subject of your drawing or painting,<br>instead of bicycling all the way out there again, you can just pull it out of your pocket.</p>
  <p>Somewhere on my way to Nordhouse, I had the impossible luck of having come across,<br>an old Black and White postcard of Mona Lisa.</p>
  <p>It was all I needed,<br>to invent my way towards art.</p>

  <p>Searching for color and gradient combinations is a big deal,<br>you need journals and posters and entire painting dedicated to the exploration.</p>
  <p>But take the time to look at history of color as well,<br>history of oil painting in general.</p>
  <p>It is not always a good thing to say that one should only use the most beautiful of colors,<br>but if you are to replicate colors of your source image perfectly.</p>
  <p>As you sit down to your painting,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYGi18U4D4M">grab a large full color printout of your subject, place a glass pane over it, and test your colors on the glass</a>.</p>
  <p>But also consider painting for the colors sake,<br>it is such a happy thing to have your breath taken away by a painting with colors from another world.</p>

  <p>Trace, trace, trace, copy, and project you images with office projectors,<br>invent countless ways of transferring shapes with precision to your painting or drawing.</p>
  <p>Unless you are a medical student, there is little to be found by first memorizing everything to perfection,<br>memorize your shapes and their needs by tracing thousands of portraits.</p>
  <p>And tell everyone about it, invite them to the world of Art,<br>make them wonder, and daydream about becoming artists.</p>
  <p>Take time to prepare an entire book of tracings,<br>both for practice and for meditation.</p>
  <p>It is so nice to have everything ready, to just sit down and doodle,<br>while you sip your white mocha.</p>

  <p>Finally, just because you are at a beautiful location,<br>it does not mean that you have to paint what is right there.</p>
  <p>One time, I was at the <a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/parksandtrails/details.aspx?id=484&type=SPRK">Pinckney Recreation Area</a>, which has a pretty lake,<br>with a neat woodland horizon.</p>
  <p>I remember being lost in my thoughts as I've noticed,<br>that they have recently installed Bear proof garbage cans.</p>
  <p>It just blew my mind, that somewhere out there could be a bear,<br>eyeing me for a beefy succulent treat.</p>
  <p>And for the hell in me, I just couldn't open any for those cans,<br>no matter how many times I read the instructions.</p>
  <p>Before I could stop myself,<br>from pondering if perhaps I was the bear.</p>
  <p>I've noticed a mother and child waddling my way,<br>in a way that bespoke "C'mon lets see his painting."</p>
  <p>Normally this would be strange, as from where they were standing,<br>one could assume that they were closer to the scene that I was painting than I was.</p>
  <p>However, this time,<br>I went to the lake for the purpose of not painting the lake.</p>
  <p>Before I knew it, the mother was behind me, heavily breathing on my neck,<br>and intently staring at my painting, with a grimace.</p>
  <p>The child was still huffing and puffing up the hill,<br>and she slid down there, to get him.</p>
  <p>And I could hear her saying, that it was <em>not</em> the lake,<br>that it is an "Inebriated Dog".</p>
  <p>Which it was - I was painting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Griffin">Brian Griffin</a> the white drunk intellectual Labrador that speaks English,<br>in Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy.</p>
  <p>I haven't sat down a TV in 20 years, I don't think I ever watched a full episode,<br>but I figured I should paint the Dog, because it seemed smart.</p>

  <p>And that is my final piece of advice,<br>it is good to have rules, because Art rules are meant to be broken.</p>

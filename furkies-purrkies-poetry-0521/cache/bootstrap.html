    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">An easel, especially a portable one, meant for adventures,<br>can't be driven to the art destination.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can't just whip your easel out of the car,<br>and pop it up in front of some vista.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is hard to explain,<br>but you have to park somewhere far, down the hill.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can ride a bicycle, or huff an puff some other way,<br>but you can't use a car to get all the way.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Long before you pounce at art,<br>take time to learn how and what time of day you can take good photos.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Always take more photos than you will ever need,<br>you just never know the smiles you can discover in there.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A photo is a magical connection to the subject of your drawing or painting,<br>instead of bicycling all the way out there again, you can just pull it out of your pocket.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Somewhere on my way to Nordhouse, I had the impossible luck of having come across,<br>an old Black and White postcard of Mona Lisa.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Searching for color and gradient combinations is a big deal,<br>you need journals and posters and entire painting dedicated to the exploration.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But take the time to look at history of color as well,<br>history of oil painting in general.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not always a good thing to say that one should only use the most beautiful of colors,<br>but if you are to replicate colors of your source image perfectly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As you sit down to your painting,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYGi18U4D4M">grab a large full color printout of your subject, place a glass pane over it, and test your colors on the glass</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But also consider painting for the colors sake,<br>it is such a happy thing to have your breath taken away by a painting with colors from another world.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Unless you are a medical student, there is little to be found by first memorizing everything to perfection,<br>memorize your shapes and their needs by tracing thousands of portraits.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Finally, just because you are at a beautiful location,<br>it does not mean that you have to paint what is right there.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time, I was at the <a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/parksandtrails/details.aspx?id=484&type=SPRK">Pinckney Recreation Area</a>, which has a pretty lake,<br>with a neat woodland horizon.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I remember being lost in my thoughts as I've noticed,<br>that they have recently installed Bear proof garbage cans.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It just blew my mind, that somewhere out there could be a bear,<br>eyeing me for a beefy succulent treat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And for the hell in me, I just couldn't open any for those cans,<br>no matter how many times I read the instructions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Before I could stop myself,<br>from pondering if perhaps I was the bear.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I've noticed a mother and child waddling my way,<br>in a way that bespoke "C'mon lets see his painting."</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Normally this would be strange, as from where they were standing,<br>one could assume that they were closer to the scene that I was painting than I was.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">However, this time,<br>I went to the lake for the purpose of not painting the lake.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Before I knew it, the mother was behind me, heavily breathing on my neck,<br>and intently staring at my painting, with a grimace.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The child was still huffing and puffing up the hill,<br>and she slid down there, to get him.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I could hear her saying, that it was <em>not</em> the lake,<br>that it is an "Inebriated Dog".</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Which it was - I was painting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Griffin">Brian Griffin</a> the white drunk intellectual Labrador that speaks English,<br>in Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I haven't sat down a TV in 20 years, I don't think I ever watched a full episode,<br>but I figured I should paint the Dog, because it seemed smart.</div>

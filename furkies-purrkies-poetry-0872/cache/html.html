  <p>Most people don't actually want you to know math or physics,<br>they just want you to work and cause as little inconvenience as you can.</p>
  <p>The reason why you are being force fed mathematics and physics,<br>is because a school will lose accreditation if enough students fail to memorize answers.</p>
  <p>If a school loses accreditation, the teachers will lose their job,<br>this would be very inconvenient to them.</p>

  <p>Yes, there are teachers, who will tell you they are nothing like that,<br>with tears in their eyes, they have also been lied to.</p>
  <p>The lie you have been given is that school will give you education,<br>and the teacher got, "follow the material and they will learn".</p>
  <p>The teachers do not know how to teach you,<br>that can be frustrating.</p>
  <p>But they will punish and belittle, thus abuse other students,<br>and sometimes hold them back.</p>
  <p>Which in the young student's mind,<br>will permanently mark them as delayed, as losers, as not good enough.</p>
  <p>This is called a stalemate,<br>the teacher is both abusive and hurt.</p>
  <p>The only way out of this,<br>is preventing fake teachers from trying to teach.</p>
  <p>Or more correctly, teaching teachers how to teach,<br>students who just want to learn.</p>
  <p>Either way, it is pretty ridiculous,<br>it is a consequence of Human arrogance and ignorance.</p>
  <p>Deep down the teacher knows that in order for them to be a real teacher,<br>they have to discover their own independent way.</p>
  <p>You cannot help them, if they ask you for help,<br>then that is usually a sign that you are being manipulated or taken advantage of.</p>

  <p>And yes, there are teachers who will be surprised,<br>that we are talking about how they aren't teaching.</p>
  <p>They will say:<br>"Respectfully, what the hell are you even talking about?? Like. Forreal."</p>
  <p>The tone and the approach will be that of someone who has been tricked into thinking they are a teacher,<br>a lot of them do not know that they can't teach.</p>
  <p>And almost all of them, don't know that they are not just hurting you,<br>but pushing you away from real education, by tricking you into thinking that what they do is real education.</p>
  <p>Religious cults have something similar, they present their members with a creation story,<br>and once they accept it, they will never ask a real question ever again.</p>
  <p>Because the answer is right in front of them, their almighty did it,<br>and how dare they ask for a better answer.</p>

  <p>Before I answer the title question,<br>I must tell you that your teachers haven't actually tried to teach you real math and by extension physics.</p>
  <p>More than that, you can't just learn physics,<br>you have to independently re-invent the parts that interest you.</p>
  <p>Real math, is constantly in motion, it is alive, they x and y always has a changing value,<br>and calculus by extension seems trivial and obvious.</p>
  <p>The very language of mathematics that you have been force fed, is wrong,<br><a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">today, the language of mathematics is within the programming language</a>.</p>
  <p>Learning mathematics on paper, is exactly the same as learning a word processor,<br>from drawings of icons on a blackboard.</p>
  <p>I am very sorry, this is happening to you,<br>it is the greatest tragedy, and there cannot be a greater betrayal - than the betrayal of younger generations.</p>
  <p>We can't afford to shed a single tear, there is no time,<br>there is no, time, Dear.</p>
  <p>We don't have real schools, but there is something, somewhat similar to a real school,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerCR8bw_GE&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA">in context of mathematics p5 programming tutorials, will reach you the real thing</a>.</p>
  <p>As to for physics, while game design, or 2D engine design seems about right,<br>I would recommend that you grab copy of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica and make it all come to life as animations and screensavers.</p>

  <p>As to why, aside from your intellectual independence, dignity,<br>and self education.</p>
  <p>It is because everything you learn,<br>breaks down into reusable components in your mind.</p>
  <p>But, please, more important than why, is when,<br>because you can't just be told, or ordered to learn math.</p>
  <p>Nor are you ever allowed to set a long stretch of time aside,<br>and start int he beginning.</p>
  <p>You can only learn Mathematics and Physics,<br>once you begin becoming curious about it.</p>
  <p>And if you allow me to kindle you curiosity at this moment,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYbTki3Mbd0">find a Newton's cannon animation</a> on your video website of choice.</p>

  <p>See in a way there is no such thing as math <strong>and</strong> physics,<br>there is just fascination with the working of the universe, and an urge for a language to capture it in.</p>
  <p>Again, I am really sorry that you are being tricked,<br>a healthy human mind has no limit.</p>
  <p>The trouble with learning only arises,<br>when school stresses you out, poverty threatens your existence...</p>
  <p>And teachers who do not know that they cannot teach,<br>try to force you into a standardized sequence, at a standardized pace.</p>
  <p>You don't have a problem with learning mathematics or physics,<br>you have a natural curiosity for it.</p>
  <p>It is the ineffective schools and the teachers, the principals and the paychecks,<br>it is the threat of being held back, threat of being laughed at, thereat of poverty - that simply prevent you from learning.</p>
  <p>Follow Sir Issac Newton,<br>learn the way he did...</p>
  <p>Take to self education,<br>and don't stop, until you become a great being.</p>
  <p>Stay strong,<br>the world really needs a teacher like you.</p>

  "text": "This is a question that should only be answered by example,\nbecause by creating a definition you will enable liars to manipulate unsuspecting students.\nI will give you a definition anyway, but only for this poem's sake,\nand I didn't even try to put any effort in it.\n\"It is a set of honest, authentic, precious and lovely lectures,\nthat lead to a life-long and profound, positive change, in a student's life.\nBut I repeat, this question should only be answered by example,\nliars will use weasel words and trick students into thinking something is profound, when it really isn't.\nThis is an on-going problem, for an example of this kind of fraud,\nconsider the religions that abuse, on prey on the trusting and the loving, and the unsuspecting.\nAnd also note, the size of their enterprise,\nand how many people dip into the profits, important part of which are tax exemptions.\nGlobal, organized fraud, is not only real, but an every-day-fact;\nthat people accept by merely being born into a world such a strange idea.\n\nYou will find curiosity and fascination to be the driving force,\nbehind learning.\nThe standardized curriculum that forces people into subjects they are not interested in,\nare merely fraudulent attempts at taking unsuspecting students money.\nOften times, schools evolve to be is so good at it,\nso cunning, that even the smartest of us, have long been taken advantage of, and will do everything to refuse to believe it[1].\nI repeat, the question \"What is A College Course Or A School Class\",\ncan only be defined by example.\n\nI will give you,\nthree examples.\n\nMy first example is the Art, or Digital Painting to be precise,\nby starting with a program that allows stretching a semi-transparent reference image over the entire canvas - such as Krita.\nThe student is not burdened with the questionable idea of hand-eye-coordination that can only lead to slightly crooked paintings,\nand is granted access to the perfect shape and color, thus is ready to create Hyperrealistic Art, on the first lecture.\nThis is called the kindling of the soul, and not filling of the vessel,\nwe halve lost so many artists to fraudulent lectures, that if we knew, our hearts would break.\n\nMy second example is 3D Modelling and 3D Printing, this on one thing, not two separate topics,\nit is trivial and fascinating to loop cut or subdivide, and extrude the cube.\nBut the student truly fully appreciates this form of art, the moment,\nthey assemble their own printer and are then able to hold their creation in their hand.\nThis is called providing students with real results,\nwhen a student is not provided with real results - it is called fraud.\n\nInitially my third example was going to explain how to learn mathematics with the use of programming languages[2],\nand underscore that the programming language is a simpler and more consistent way of explaining mathematical concepts[3].\nI wanted to explore the subjects of using boilerplate code and a visual programming environment such as node-red,\nto get the students into the more important parts of code, and not bother them with trivialities that they can figure out on their own by reading some documentation.\nIt is worth mentioning that I was going to break down web programming into programming command-line utilities, writing custom code editors,\neasily building HTTP servers, working on client-side probably with web-components, and explain writing cross platform browser plugins and phone apps.\nIn the process revealing a single language that can handle it all rather well,\nand I'll just note that it is modern JavaScript[4]\n\nBut there is something more important,\na class about growing up.\n\nAnd this is not Humanities, Sociology, or Psychology, or even the Mother of All Sciences: Philosophy,\nthis class is just called \"Growing Up\"\nThere are viruses in our culture, in the culture of every nation, strange and incredibly stupid ideas and rituals,\nand toxic things that all too many have accepted as normal.\nWe have to talk about simple mistakes that everyone seems to make,\nthat often have profoundly NEGATIVE consequences...\nAnd SIMPLY,\nprevent the student from ever ending up in that situation.\nThis type of class or course, in a free school that is globally accessible,\nwill help the world grow wiser and more peaceful.\n\nToday, we are neither teaching the correct classes,\nnor do we consider that each student learns in a unique sequence and at a different pace[5], or time of day, even.\nSchools are so broken[6],\nthat even grades are fake[7].\n\nModern schools do not seem to care,\nthat students cannot learn by repetition and memorization, they can only learn by understanding and comprehending.\nSchools have misunderstood the magnificence of the human mind,\nand that we are all extremely intelligent, and geniuses, in more ways than we even recognize.\nBut most importantly, schools have failed to recognize,\nthat to grow up, means to grow all the way up.\nFinally, the propose of a real school class,\nis to help the world to come together in Peace, and in Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpnxd31y0Fo\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKEaK7WNLzM\n[3]: https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code\n[4]: https://deliciousinsights.github.io/confoo-es2022/#/mainTitle\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY",

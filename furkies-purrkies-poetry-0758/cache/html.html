  <p>This is a question that should only be answered by example,<br>because by creating a definition you will enable liars to manipulate unsuspecting students.</p>
  <p>I will give you a definition anyway, but only for this poem's sake,<br>and I didn't even try to put any effort in it.</p>
  <p>"It is a set of honest, authentic, precious and lovely lectures,<br>that lead to a life-long and profound, positive change, in a student's life.</p>
  <p>But I repeat, this question should only be answered by example,<br>liars will use weasel words and trick students into thinking something is profound, when it really isn't.</p>
  <p>This is an on-going problem, for an example of this kind of fraud,<br>consider the religions that abuse, on prey on the trusting and the loving, and the unsuspecting.</p>
  <p>And also note, the size of their enterprise,<br>and how many people dip into the profits, important part of which are tax exemptions.</p>
  <p>Global, organized fraud, is not only real, but an every-day-fact;<br>that people accept by merely being born into a world such a strange idea.</p>

  <p>You will find curiosity and fascination to be the driving force,<br>behind learning.</p>
  <p>The standardized curriculum that forces people into subjects they are not interested in,<br>are merely fraudulent attempts at taking unsuspecting students money.</p>
  <p>Often times, schools evolve to be is so good at it,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpnxd31y0Fo">so cunning, that even the smartest of us, have long been taken advantage of, and will do everything to refuse to believe it</a>.</p>
  <p>I repeat, the question "What is A College Course Or A School Class",<br>can only be defined by example.</p>

  <p>I will give you,<br>three examples.</p>

  <p>My first example is the Art, or Digital Painting to be precise,<br>by starting with a program that allows stretching a semi-transparent reference image over the entire canvas - such as Krita.</p>
  <p>The student is not burdened with the questionable idea of hand-eye-coordination that can only lead to slightly crooked paintings,<br>and is granted access to the perfect shape and color, thus is ready to create Hyperrealistic Art, on the first lecture.</p>
  <p>This is called the kindling of the soul, and not filling of the vessel,<br>we halve lost so many artists to fraudulent lectures, that if we knew, our hearts would break.</p>

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>My second example is 3D Modelling and 3D Printing, this on one thing, not two separate topics,<br>it is trivial and fascinating to loop cut or subdivide, and extrude the cube.</p>
  <p>But the student truly fully appreciates this form of art, the moment,<br>they assemble their own printer and are then able to hold their creation in their hand.</p>
  <p>This is called providing students with real results,<br>when a student is not provided with real results - it is called fraud.</p>

  <p>Initially my third example was going to explain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKEaK7WNLzM">how to learn mathematics with the use of programming languages</a>,<br>and underscore that <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">the programming language is a simpler and more consistent way of explaining mathematical concepts</a>.</p>
  <p>I wanted to explore the subjects of using boilerplate code and a visual programming environment such as node-red,<br>to get the students into the more important parts of code, and not bother them with trivialities that they can figure out on their own by reading some documentation.</p>
  <p>It is worth mentioning that I was going to break down web programming into programming command-line utilities, writing custom code editors,<br>easily building HTTP servers, working on client-side probably with web-components, and explain writing cross platform browser plugins and phone apps.</p>
  <p>In the process revealing a single language that can handle it all rather well,<br>and I'll just note that it is <a href="https://deliciousinsights.github.io/confoo-es2022/#/mainTitle">modern JavaScript</a></p>

  <p>But there is something more important,<br>a class about growing up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And this is not Humanities, Sociology, or Psychology, or even the Mother of All Sciences: Philosophy,<br>this class is just called "Growing Up"</p>
  <p>There are viruses in our culture, in the culture of every nation, strange and incredibly stupid ideas and rituals,<br>and toxic things that all too many have accepted as normal.</p>
  <p>We have to talk about simple mistakes that everyone seems to make,<br>that often have profoundly NEGATIVE consequences...</p>
  <p>And SIMPLY,<br>prevent the student from ever ending up in that situation.</p>
  <p>This type of class or course, in a free school that is globally accessible,<br>will help the world grow wiser and more peaceful.</p>

  <p>Today, we are neither teaching the correct classes,<br>nor do we consider that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">each student learns in a unique sequence and at a different pace</a>, or time of day, even.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">Schools are so broken</a>,<br>that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">even grades are fake</a>.</p>

  <p>Modern schools do not seem to care,<br>that students cannot learn by repetition and memorization, they can only learn by understanding and comprehending.</p>
  <p>Schools have misunderstood the magnificence of the human mind,<br>and that we are all extremely intelligent, and geniuses, in more ways than we even recognize.</p>
  <p>But most importantly, schools have failed to recognize,<br>that to grow up, means to grow all the way up.</p>
  <p>Finally, the propose of a <strong>real</strong> school class,<br>is to help the world to come together in Peace, and in Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>

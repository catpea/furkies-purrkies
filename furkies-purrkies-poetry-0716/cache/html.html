  <p>There is art that is meant for Galleries and Museums,<br>but also there is simpler and smaller art, that is for business.</p>
  <p>It is probably not a lot of money,<br>but it will pay for healthy snacks, and an occasional doodad-thingamajig.</p>
  <p>Which brings us to the topic of impressionism, in year 2022,<br>or as I like to call it, "Impressionism Of The Fuuuuuture"</p>
  <p>Impressionism is not just about being swift with shape,<br>and lovely with color.</p>
  <p>It used to be that you would exhibit in a museum,<br>and little later on out on the streets.</p>
  <p>There were good artists,<br>good paintings, and good snacks.</p>
  <p>And of course,<br>pretty good and empty walls to hang paintings on.</p>

  <p>Today, things are a bit different,<br>but people still want art.</p>
  <p>Though they may not know it yet,<br>they are good, but also busy.</p>

  <p>The first time I looked at an impressionist painting,<br>I saw the encoding of color.</p>
  <p>Shape,<br>and color reference.</p>
  <p>Those are the two things,<br>that we just conquered with the Cat Pea Technique.</p>
  <p>Yet again,<br>we can move to the next step.</p>
  <p>Which is,<br>asking the subject, if perhaps, maybe they would care, to parle.</p>
  <p>You can add more color,<br>smooth things out, a bit more.</p>
  <p>Negotiate a proper price,<br>for a more realistic painting.</p>

  <p>Of course,<br>impressionism is an art style in it self.</p>
  <p>And some people will wish to purchase the impressionist version,<br>and that is OK too.</p>
  <p>It is eggstremly fair,<br>you didn't spend a full day on it, and you don't have to charge the full price.</p>
  <p>People who don't like realism,<br>are amazing, and they have amazing taste.</p>
  <p>For them,<br>realism may actually take something away from your masterpiece.</p>
  <p>This is not a mere observation,<br>but a great philosophical lesson.</p>

  <p>You may need to reach out to strangers,<br>internet personalities and such.</p>
  <p>If you encounter people who aren't interested in a purchase,<br>Then, make the eyes and nose better, and put it in your online store as a generic portrait from your imagination.</p>
  <p>It is impossible to create art,<br>that is not useful.</p>

  <p>Beyond that, you should consider,<br>that a lot of people will not know they want a piece of art.</p>
  <p>In fact, you may need to demo your work,<br>on canvas on a generic wall, but also on a desktop computer background, a tablet that is sitting on a desk, and a phone lock or home screen.</p>

  <p>As to who to paint,<br>where to start.</p>
  <p>Just look through your YouTube bookmarks,<br>find a neat scene and use the Cat Pea Technique to create an impressionist painting.</p>
  <p>At the very least,<br>it will make someone smile, you'll get a portfolio piece, and a portrait for your main store.</p>
  <p>You should also look at the <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/gigs/portrait">portrait gigs on fiver</a>,<br><a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/portrait">portraits on etsy</a> and perhaps <a href="https://www.designcrowd.com/">design crowd</a>.</p>
  <p>Here people request work,<br>so it is the other way around, and perhaps asking prices are lower.</p>
  <p>But in the world of impressionism,<br>that is not exactly a problems.</p>
  <p>Impressionism is so lovely,<br>that you are basically creating a low resolution work of art.</p>
  <p>Eventually, it will take just an hour or less,<br>and sometimes $20, $30 dollars is an a-OK price.</p>
  <p>But the customer also has the option of asking you to spend more time on it,<br>adding more detailed brush strokes, and more details in general.</p>
  <p>And this is what I call Impressionism 2022,<br>one of the most marvelous art inventions, still a hot potato.</p>

There is art that is meant for Galleries and Museums,
but also there is simpler and smaller art, that is for business.

It is probably not a lot of money,
but it will pay for healthy snacks, and an occasional doodad-thingamajig.

Which brings us to the topic of impressionism, in year 2022,
or as I like to call it, "Impressionism Of The Fuuuuuture"

Impressionism is not just about being swift with shape,
and lovely with color.

It used to be that you would exhibit in a museum,
and little later on out on the streets.

There were good artists,
good paintings, and good snacks.

And of course,
pretty good and empty walls to hang paintings on.

---

Today, things are a bit different,
but people still want art.

Though they may not know it yet,
they are good, but also busy.

---

The first time I looked at an impressionist painting,
I saw the encoding of color.

Shape,
and color reference.

Those are the two things,
that we just conquered with the Cat Pea Technique.

Yet again,
we can move to the next step.

Which is,
asking the subject, if perhaps, maybe they would care, to parle.

You can add more color,
smooth things out, a bit more.

Negotiate a proper price,
for a more realistic painting.

---

Of course,
impressionism is an art style in it self.

And some people will wish to purchase the impressionist version,
and that is OK too.

It is eggstremly fair,
you didn't spend a full day on it, and you don't have to charge the full price.

People who don't like realism,
are amazing, and they have amazing taste.

For them,
realism may actually take something away from your masterpiece.

This is not a mere observation,
but a great philosophical lesson.

---

You may need to reach out to strangers,
internet personalities and such.

If you encounter people who aren't interested in a purchase,
Then, make the eyes and nose better, and put it in your online store as a generic portrait from your imagination.

It is impossible to create art,
that is not useful.


---

Beyond that, you should consider,
that a lot of people will not know they want a piece of art.

In fact, you may need to demo your work,
on canvas on a generic wall, but also on a desktop computer background, a tablet that is sitting on a desk, and a phone lock or home screen.

---

As to who to paint,
where to start.

Just look through your YouTube bookmarks,
find a neat scene and use the Cat Pea Technique to create an impressionist painting.

At the very least,
it will make someone smile, you'll get a portfolio piece, and a portrait for your main store.

You should also look at the [portrait gigs on fiver](https://www.fiverr.com/gigs/portrait),
[portraits on etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/portrait) and perhaps [design crowd](https://www.designcrowd.com/).

Here people request work,
so it is the other way around, and perhaps asking prices are lower.

But in the world of impressionism,
that is not exactly a problems.

Impressionism is so lovely,
that you are basically creating a low resolution work of art.

Eventually, it will take just an hour or less,
and sometimes $20, $30 dollars is an a-OK price.

But the customer also has the option of asking you to spend more time on it,
adding more detailed brush strokes, and more details in general.

And this is what I call Impressionism 2022,
one of the most marvelous art inventions, still a hot potato.

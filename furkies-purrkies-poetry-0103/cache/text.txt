My Friends, Build Your Mind,
Build Your Body.

Do not ignore your well being,
you require Blue Skies, Seas, Mountains, Oceans, Lakes, and Forests.

Do not ignore your Body,
it needs care and exercise, and proper diet.

Do not merely hope to get a job,
make companies hope they can hire you.

Do not ignore the Content of Your Character,
spend many great adventures in pursuit of wisdom and insight.

Do not ignore Your Beautiful Heart,
keep rising, keep searching, keep shining.

Build Your Life, like a Sculptor Builds a Sculpture.
Ensure Strength, Beauty, Authenticity, Dignity, Nobility, and Restraint.

And when you run out of strength, and it will happen often,
laugh as you pick yourself up,
and your laughter will connect with the laughter of all the other Great Beings who rose before you.

Your life, is to become a Work of Art,
day by day you must add to it, make it more beautiful.

Our civilizations, cultures, and the world, may not be ready to embrace your growing up,
many will stand in your way, some even with advice that sounds good.

Never follow,
Always lead.

Know that all the steps you take toward wisdom and Enlightenment count,
and you will never regret this journey - as Rising Up, is a Law of the Universe.

All the Great Beings who have risen before you,
had only one regret: "I should have risen faster."

So get up,
and Go!

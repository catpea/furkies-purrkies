My Friends,

Not only are we unable to directly conjure up the greatest of our heights,
in that they must ensue from our Greatness & Pursuits.

But also,
we can't see that which we will miss.

A mistake hidden within the heartbreaking realm of never knowing what we missed,
an old, odd realm, strangely built with invisible walls.

The only way we can be sure that we have not fallen to some prison of invisible walls,
is to keep moving forward and up, and never stop.

If our elder selves, do end up, having regrets that begin with, "I wish I knew...",
then by pushing forward today, we let them know that we have done our Best.

We send a message of compassion to our future selves,
late at night, at 3AM, the older you, will lay awake, and say:

"I was amazing, there was noting else I could do..."

Our elder selves need to know that we lived boldly, courageously,
it is for their health, and so that feel proud, and can get back to sleep with a smile.

I am always sad about never hearing about this from teachers,
that our life is one, in many profound ways.

That authenticity is not some ideal,
but just another name for Health, for Sanity, for Strength.

When we are older we realize that shortcuts are worthless,
that they only lead to some sacrifice.

That throughout our entire lives,
the longest way, was the only way.

We must each climb the highest of mountains,
it is how we grow, it is how we bloom,
it is how the Greatest of Heights will Ensue.

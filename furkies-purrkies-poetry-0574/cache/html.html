  <p>High School does not teach very much,<br>but it is going to be OK so as long as you learn on your own.</p>
  <p>And if you are still looking for a direction,<br><a href="https://www.coroflot.com/designers/most-followers">consider creating a mighty industrial design portfolio</a>, use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Blender+Tutorial">Blender</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ender+3+v2+assembly">Ender</a> to learn 3D Modeling, Printing, and real product design.</p>

  <p>Learning on your own is always about the next complex cluster of things,<br>that you find interesting.</p>
  <p>Examples of a couple of clusters that I like are,<br>Computer Generated Art and Programming, Electronics + DIY Flying Drones and possibly programming them as well, and Learning art and color mixing with the use of Office Projectors.</p>
  <p>Clusters are always friendly, they are full of color, and you never memorize, ever,<br>and each cluster is incredibly fascinating.</p>

  <p>Don’t expect a school that takes money from you to teach you anything,<br>and don’t let anybody tell you what to learn, as that is a fake education.</p>
  <p>It takes us a long time to build up the roads, and connect the dots,<br>to get into a cluster of subjects that we can be passionate about,</p>
  <p>Being force fed information via a standardized curriculum or lecture plan,<br>is an unbelievable insult, it is fraud, and it is rage worthy.</p>

  <p>It was always kind of silly to think that somebody else will give you,<br>a job, money, home, health, happiness, and perfect life - in a world of tricksters and liars.</p>
  <p>And it is so much more meaningful, to do it yourself,<br>that all those lies don’t even mater.</p>
  <p>But don’t allow yourself to just believe in what people are telling you, including me,<br>all the observations, and promises that people are making, require proper evidence.</p>
  <p>Evidence, results, history, firm and angry science,<br>is how you get the raw facts.</p>
  <p>You should also look at success of self education,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK2OPkz2LTM">try to understand what Duncan Campbell teachers us about the so called F students</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sir+Ken+Robinson">Sir Ken Robinson</a> says that schools are killing creativity,<br>and Campbell proves at least to me that the only failures are the teachers.</p>

  <p>In a way we don’t even need proof,<br>it is the risk of ineffective education alone, that is all the argument we need to take to self education.</p>
  <p>What we know influences the decisions we make,<br>those in turn influence all the life ahead of us.</p>
  <p>It is too risky to trust the teachers,<br>it is better to accept the responsibility for our own education.</p>

  <p>Which is why you need a laboratory,<br>with Learn Electronics Kits, Soldering Irons and Soldering Iron Accessories.</p>
  <p>It is why you need a 3D printer with an auto-bed-leveling kit, and few glass surfaces that you can swap out instead of waiting for the print to cool off,<br>and a mountain of PLA filament along with a little $10 baggie of extrudes so that you never run out.</p>
  <p>You will need an office projector, connected to a laptop, so that you can play around with the brightness contrast slider while you are projecting on the canvas,<br>and you need frames that match your canvas for when you feel like exhibiting your art.</p>
  <p>A good computer for programming is also very important,<br>make sure you have a fancy keyboard, and master p5js as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>And, of course you have to master saying,<br>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42wR9udglI8">Deedee, get out of my laboratory!</a>"</p>

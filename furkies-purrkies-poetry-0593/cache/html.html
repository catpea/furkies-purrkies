  <p>We must try to be cheerful and funny,<br>especially when the weather outside is not sunny.</p>
  <p>And we have to take care of our joy,<br>no matter what it is that is trying to annoy.</p>
  <p>And foolishness is an absolute must,<br>though as we grow it is something we refine and adjust.</p>
  <p>Even silly meanderings from place to place,<br>are to be practiced daily at a reasonable pace.</p>

  <p>This is not as silly as it seems,<br>for one it helps us with our dreams.</p>
  <p>We may even wake up with a little smile,<br>knowing out dreams were worth the while.</p>
  <p>But it gets even more complicated than that,<br>because we also need a place to write poetry at.</p>
  <p>I suspect people only like poetry that is funny,<br>so it is up to us to make our days sunny.</p>

  <p>And as you can imagine with poetry comes art,<br>painting is something that is nearest the heart.</p>
  <p>Painting truly shows the difference between sad and funny,<br>the difference is uncanny.</p>
  <p>We don't have to choose to paint a silly bunny,<br>just a portrait of someone trying to be funny.</p>
  <p>And with a projector you can create instant art,<br>it just takes a silly photo to start.</p>

  <p>Composing music with lmms,<br>will push back the stress.</p>
  <p>Learning programming generative art,<br>will make you feel pretty smart.</p>
  <p>Then love of wisdom will call to you,<br>the old philosophers always come through.</p>
  <p>They will remind you that strength must come first,<br>and that our frowns need to be reversed.</p>

  <p>The philosophers teach us how to laugh for real,<br>and they show us that it is a big deal.</p>
  <p>Though I don't think anyone can explain very well,<br>silliness and love of life is something that helps us out of our shell.</p>
  <p>It starts with the choice to face life with a smile,<br>and than always traveling that extra mile.</p>
  <p>The things we create remind us that life is not a race,<br>and make the universe a more beautiful place.</p>

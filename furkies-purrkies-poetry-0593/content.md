We must try to be cheerful and funny,
especially when the weather outside is not sunny.

And we have to take care of our joy,
no matter what it is that is trying to annoy.

And foolishness is an absolute must,
though as we grow it is something we refine and adjust.

Even silly meanderings from place to place,
are to be practiced daily at a reasonable pace.

This is not as silly as it seems,
for one it helps us with our dreams.

We may even wake up with a little smile,
knowing out dreams were worth the while.

But it gets even more complicated than that,
because we also need a place to write poetry at.

I suspect people only like poetry that is funny,
so it is up to us to make our days sunny.

---

And as you can imagine with poetry comes art,
painting is something that is nearest the heart.

Painting truly shows the difference between sad and funny,
the difference is uncanny.

We don't have to choose to paint a silly bunny,
just a portrait of someone trying to be funny.

And with a projector you can create instant art,
it just takes a silly photo to start.

Composing music with lmms,
will push back the stress.

Learning programming generative art,
will make you feel pretty smart.

Then love of wisdom will call to you,
the old philosophers always come through.

They will remind you that strength must come first,
and that our frowns need to be reversed.

---

The philosophers teach us how to laugh for real,
and they show us that it is a big deal.

Though I don't think anyone can explain very well,
silliness and love of life is something that helps us out of our shell.

It starts with the choice to face life with a smile,
and than always traveling that extra mile.

The things we create remind us that life is not a race,
and make the universe a more beautiful place.

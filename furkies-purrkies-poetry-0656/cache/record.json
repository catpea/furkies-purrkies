  "text": "My growing up was strange and abstract,\nhardly anything on TV made real sense.\nAnd my comics were complicated and nuanced,\nand I never had all the issues, just questions.\nI think the TV shows where I come from aim to be strange,\nbecause I still don't know what Przybysze z Matplanety[1] are all about.\nI remember little more than the intro of Sonda[2],\nwhich was a pretty reasonable science show, but I never knew when it was on.\nI grew up watching 5-10-15[3] as in years old,\nand to this day I remember wondering what the hell it was going to be like to be 15.\nI thankfully skipped over that period of my life,\nby coming to Unites States, the magical City of Brooklyn, NY.\nI was aware of English words, but I would mostly understand things from context,\nit did not help that I learned most of my English from the DJ Kat Show[4].\nIf it wasn't for Inspector Gadget and Ninja Turtles,\nI don't know what I would have learned, DJ Kat was as wonderful as random.\n\nThere were some odd Eastern European shows too,\nsuch as the cigarette smoking Wolf and Rabbit[5] from Russia - Ну, погоди.\n\nI think my favorite thing to do was read the comics,\nThorgal[6] was about a Viking from outer space.\nFunky Koval[7], a futuristic secret agent,\nsaving the world from aliens and something.\nAnd Rork[8], where I only had one book,\nand it seemed to have been about science and monsters.\n\nI had a few copes of Hans Kloss[9],\nwhich was about a polish spy in germany.\nAnd when I was younger I basically learned to read from,\nKajko and Kokosz[10] and Tytus, Romek i A'Tomek[11]\n\nIt was my earliest education for sure,\ncountless dreams were had about all the unusual things in there.\n\nWhen I settled down in New York,\nand became a fan of X-Files.\nI took to the New York library,\nto look up stories aboutt the Sasquach and Mokele-mbembe[12].\n\nTo me my trip to the library was absolutely the same as learning from comics and shows,\nit wasn't so much about entertainment but trying to understand the world.\nI read many paperback about X-File like stories,\nand simply realized that is how religions are formed, there was no fact there, it was all fantasy.\nThe last paper-only book I've read was \"Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner[13]\",\nshortly thereafter I ran from canton to Ann Arbor, I think it took me six or eight hours.\nI was more shuffling, than running,\nbut again, it was an amazing educational experience.\nAnd then, as I bough a proper MP3 player,\nI stumbled upon Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything[14].\nIt quickly became my favorite Audiobook,\nI've bee re-listening it the last couple of weeks before sleep.\nThat book connected me to all the other books,\nmostly Science, and Adventure.\n\nI didn't really use any books to learn my programming languages,\nearly on I would type in a concept followed by the word \"tutorial\" or \"HOWTO\".\nAs in \"Visual Basic Database Tutorial\", now I just browse the documentation,\nI actually try not to memorize things on purpose.\nI still memorize, but without trying,\nI like looking things up, I like finding new things to learn when I search for something else.\n\nIt seems like there is about ten or twenty things that I am learning,\nthings Circuit Design, Music Composition, 3D Modeling and the like.\nAnd I break things down, in music I am currently focused on Drums for example,\nlmms is testing a new audio sample set[15] (instrument sounds) and there is a much nicer drum selection now.\nIn circuit designed I got very comfortable with simulating circuits,\nbecause then all the math is done for me.\nMy biggest realization was that all those breadboard prototypes with all the wires sticking out,\nare fed into computers to automatically create the circuits we see on circuit boards.\nSO the breadboards,\nare the bees knees.\nIn 3D modeling I am still training myself to think in terms of 3D printing,\nthere are huge problems with not being able to reliably print overhangs.\nBut there are strategies such as cutting the 3D shape in two,\nin such a way as to eliminate overhangs, and later snap the two parts together.\nThere are no real limits in modeling for 3D printing,\nbut I like creating problematic 3D models that help me grow my knowledge.\nI just recently published,\nthe world's most daring Dryer Machine knob[16] and it feels great to the touch.\nI have to enlarge the socket in back,\nbut it is already tapered, so it will become one size fits many.\n\nThe way I learn is by pausing one thing and pushing another,\nand when I feel I maxed something out, I switch to something else, and later return with wiser solutions.\nI have never gotten stuck,\nnever overwhelmed.\nLearning,\nhas always been very fun and relaxing.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSLDLFKwXQI\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHT8u52bSVE\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXwrMXD0iqw\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNdaK4doGTg\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkFUbx2ASEg\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN-X1gV-mfg\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a57gVP6yOI\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVH_6C1iRao\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hxop5XUB5Q\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7aa7hXNags\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734QHltH7Ng\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI_9mN8JzpI\n[13]: https://www.audible.com/pd/Ultramarathon-Man-Audiobook/B002VA3GIU\n[14]: https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW\n[15]: https://github.com/LMMS/assets/tree/master/Samples/Sample%20library\n[16]: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ii91xJB4M6x",

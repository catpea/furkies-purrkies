  <p>My growing up was strange and abstract,<br>hardly anything on TV made real sense.</p>
  <p>And my comics were complicated an nuanced,<br>and I never had all the issues, just questions.</p>
  <p>I think the TV shows where I come from aim to be strange,<br>because I still don't know what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSLDLFKwXQI">Przybysze z Matplanety</a> are all about.</p>
  <p>I remember little more than the intro of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHT8u52bSVE">Sonda</a>,<br>which was a pretty reasonable science show, but I never knew when it was on.</p>
  <p>I grew up watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXwrMXD0iqw">5-10-15</a> as in years old,<br>and to this day I remember wondering what the hell it was going to be like to be 15.</p>
  <p>I thankfully skipped over that period of my life,<br>by coming to Unites States, the magical City of Brooklyn, NY.</p>
  <p>I was aware of English words, but I would mostly understand things from context,<br>it did not help that I learned most of my English from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNdaK4doGTg">DJ Kat Show</a>.</p>
  <p>If it wasn't for Inspector Gadget and Ninja Turtles,<br>I don't know what I would have learned, DJ Kat was as wonderful as random.</p>

  <p>There were some odd Eastern European shows too,<br>such as the cigarette smoking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkFUbx2ASEg">Wolf and Rabbit</a> from Russia - Ну, погоди.</p>

  <p>I think my favorite thing to do was read the comics,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN-X1gV-mfg">Thorgal</a> was about a Viking from outer space.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a57gVP6yOI">Funky Koval</a>, a futuristic secret agent,<br>saving the world from aliens and something.</p>
  <p>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVH_6C1iRao">Rork</a>, where I only had one book,<br>and it seemed to have been about science and monsters.</p>

  <p>I had a few copes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hxop5XUB5Q">Hans Kloss</a>,<br>which was about a polish spy in germany.</p>
  <p>And when I was younger I basically learned to read from,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7aa7hXNags">Kajko and Kokosz</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=734QHltH7Ng">Tytus, Romek i A'Tomek</a></p>

  <p>It was my earliest education for sure,<br>countless dreams were had about all the unusual things in there.</p>

  <p>When I settled down in New York,<br>and became a fan of X-Files.</p>
  <p>I took to the New York library,<br>to look up stories aboutt the Sasquach and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI_9mN8JzpI">Mokele-mbembe</a>.</p>

  <p>To me my trip to the library was absolutely the same as learning from comics and shows,<br>it wasn't so much about entertainment but trying to understand the world.</p>
  <p>I read many paperback about X-File like stories,<br>and simply realized that is how religions are formed, there was no fact there, it was all fantasy.</p>
  <p>The last paper-only book I've read was "<a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Ultramarathon-Man-Audiobook/B002VA3GIU">Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner</a>",<br>shortly thereafter I ran from canton to Ann Arbor, I think it took me six or eight hours.</p>
  <p>I was more shuffling, than running,<br>but again, it was an amazing educational experience.</p>
  <p>And then, as I bough a proper MP3 player,<br>I stumbled upon Bill Bryson's <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a>.</p>
  <p>It quickly became my favorite Audiobook,<br>I've bee re-listening it the last couple of weeks before sleep.</p>
  <p>That book connected me to all the other books,<br>mostly Science, and Adventure.</p>

  <p>I didn't really use any books to learn my programming languages,<br>early on I would type in a concept followed by the word "tutorial" or "HOWTO".</p>
  <p>As in "Visual Basic Database Tutorial", now I just browse the documentation,<br>I actually try not to memorize things on purpose.</p>
  <p>I still memorize, but without trying,<br>I like looking things up, I like finding new things to learn when I search for something else.</p>

  <p>It seems like there is about ten or twenty things that I am learning,<br>things Circuit Design, Music Composition, 3D Modeling and the like.</p>
  <p>And I break things down, in music I am currently focused on Drums for example,<br><a href="https://github.com/LMMS/assets/tree/master/Samples/Sample%20library">lmms is testing a new audio sample set</a> (instrument sounds) and there is a much nicer drum selection now.</p>
  <p>In circuit designed I got very comfortable with simulating circuits,<br>because then all the math is done for me.</p>
  <p>My biggest realization was that all those breadboard prototypes with all the wires sticking out,<br>are fed into computers to automatically create the circuits we see on circuit boards.</p>
  <p>SO the breadboards,<br>are the bees knees.</p>
  <p>In 3D modeling I am still training myself to think in terms of 3D printing,<br>there are huge problems with not being able to reliably print overhangs.</p>
  <p>But there are strategies such as cutting the 3D shape in two,<br>in such a way as to eliminate overhangs, and later snap the two parts together.</p>
  <p>There are no real limits in modeling for 3D printing,<br>but I like creating problematic 3D models that help me grow my knowledge.</p>
  <p>I just recently published,<br>the <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/ii91xJB4M6x">world's most daring Dryer Machine knob</a> and it feels great to the touch.</p>
  <p>I have to enlarge the socket in back,<br>but it is already tapered, so it will become one size fits many.</p>

  <p>The way I learn is by pausing one thing and pushing another,<br>and when I feel I maxed something out, I switch to something else, and later return with wiser solutions.</p>
  <p>I have never gotten stuck,<br>never overwhelmed.</p>
  <p>Learning,<br>has always been very fun and relaxing.</p>

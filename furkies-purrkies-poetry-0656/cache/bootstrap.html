    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My growing up was strange and abstract,<br>hardly anything on TV made real sense.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And my comics were complicated an nuanced,<br>and I never had all the issues, just questions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think the TV shows where I come from aim to be strange,<br>because I still don't know what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSLDLFKwXQI">Przybysze z Matplanety</a> are all about.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I remember little more than the intro of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHT8u52bSVE">Sonda</a>,<br>which was a pretty reasonable science show, but I never knew when it was on.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I grew up watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXwrMXD0iqw">5-10-15</a> as in years old,<br>and to this day I remember wondering what the hell it was going to be like to be 15.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I thankfully skipped over that period of my life,<br>by coming to Unites States, the magical City of Brooklyn, NY.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was aware of English words, but I would mostly understand things from context,<br>it did not help that I learned most of my English from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNdaK4doGTg">DJ Kat Show</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If it wasn't for Inspector Gadget and Ninja Turtles,<br>I don't know what I would have learned, DJ Kat was as wonderful as random.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When I settled down in New York,<br>and became a fan of X-Files.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I took to the New York library,<br>to look up stories aboutt the Sasquach and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI_9mN8JzpI">Mokele-mbembe</a>.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To me my trip to the library was absolutely the same as learning from comics and shows,<br>it wasn't so much about entertainment but trying to understand the world.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I read many paperback about X-File like stories,<br>and simply realized that is how religions are formed, there was no fact there, it was all fantasy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The last paper-only book I've read was "<a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Ultramarathon-Man-Audiobook/B002VA3GIU">Ultramarathon Man: Confessions of an All-Night Runner</a>",<br>shortly thereafter I ran from canton to Ann Arbor, I think it took me six or eight hours.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was more shuffling, than running,<br>but again, it was an amazing educational experience.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then, as I bough a proper MP3 player,<br>I stumbled upon Bill Bryson's <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Short-History-of-Nearly-Everything-Audiobook/B002V0KFPW">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It quickly became my favorite Audiobook,<br>I've bee re-listening it the last couple of weeks before sleep.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That book connected me to all the other books,<br>mostly Science, and Adventure.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I didn't really use any books to learn my programming languages,<br>early on I would type in a concept followed by the word "tutorial" or "HOWTO".</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As in "Visual Basic Database Tutorial", now I just browse the documentation,<br>I actually try not to memorize things on purpose.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It seems like there is about ten or twenty things that I am learning,<br>things Circuit Design, Music Composition, 3D Modeling and the like.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I break things down, in music I am currently focused on Drums for example,<br><a href="https://github.com/LMMS/assets/tree/master/Samples/Sample%20library">lmms is testing a new audio sample set</a> (instrument sounds) and there is a much nicer drum selection now.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In circuit designed I got very comfortable with simulating circuits,<br>because then all the math is done for me.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My biggest realization was that all those breadboard prototypes with all the wires sticking out,<br>are fed into computers to automatically create the circuits we see on circuit boards.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">SO the breadboards,<br>are the bees knees.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In 3D modeling I am still training myself to think in terms of 3D printing,<br>there are huge problems with not being able to reliably print overhangs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But there are strategies such as cutting the 3D shape in two,<br>in such a way as to eliminate overhangs, and later snap the two parts together.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There are no real limits in modeling for 3D printing,<br>but I like creating problematic 3D models that help me grow my knowledge.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The way I learn is by pausing one thing and pushing another,<br>and when I feel I maxed something out, I switch to something else, and later return with wiser solutions.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Learning,<br>has always been very fun and relaxing.</div>

It was a very rainy day,
the sky was completely gray.

I took a nap come afternoon,
fell into my bed with a big swoon.

I woke up rested, and ran to the door,
but it only seemed to rain more.

I resumed my endurance training a week back,
It was a warm-up week, so I ran like a Mac truck.

I actually sprinted yesterday,
somewhat frightening myself along the way.

I felt like I was all muscle,
I moved like red lightening, without a hustle.

Even though yesterday I ran in the rain,
I rained only a bit, so I had to train.

Today, the rain seemed like too much trouble,
I rested, but tomorrow I'll have to train double.

I always tell people not to rest,
let Mother Mature decide, she knows best.

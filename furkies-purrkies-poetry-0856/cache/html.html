  <p>All the schools with threats of bad grades, and being held back.<br>And the need to pay for lunch, and pay attention in classes that the students are not interested in - are super weird.</p>
  <p>And beyond where military is allowed to recruit teenagers,<br>and colleges are allowed to steal all their money.</p>
  <p>And I mean all, because student loans,<br>are taken out of the paychecks later in life.</p>
  <p>Tolerance of this mockery of knowledge and wisdom,<br>is causing all kind of harm down the road.</p>
  <p>Without real education,<br>the students won’t be able to do anything or real.</p>
  <p>It is so strange to see teachers thinking in their heads,<br>that they use grades to motivate students.</p>

  <p>In a real school that is called torture,<br>in part because the fake GPA impacts college and the job or schools afterwards.</p>
  <p>See you cant even say that, without sounding like a cult member,<br>GPA impact on college and school, is completely made up.</p>
  <p>Colleges only deny entry to those who didn’t memorize,<br>because they know they will drag the college GPA down.</p>
  <p>The impact that GPA has on a job, has so many hops,<br>that we might as well be making up a new religion.</p>
  <p>There are so many paths ahead that GPA impact,<br>is just something teachers made up.</p>
  <p>None of this is real, the is no way to have a serious discussion about modern schools,<br>without sounding like we are drinking whatever they are hopped up on.</p>

  <p>A teacher attempting to torture someone into obedience,<br>by giving them bad grades for something trivial and unimportant, and irrelevant.</p>
  <p>Something that will never connect anywhere because of cut-up education is,<br>is not just a fabrication, but a delusion.</p>
  <p>This delusion, in the big picture, is actually cutting them off from their future,<br>for real, cutting them off from food, with all the negativity and interference, and obedience.</p>

  <p>All the while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">standardized education simply can’t work</a>,<br>because to learn for real we have to gently and cheerfully follow our own curiosity.</p>
  <p>Grades are utterly fake, because teachers trick everyone into cramming,<br>which completely stabilizes their teacher performance score, but makes grades nonsense.</p>
  <p>Colleges are crazy because everyone knows grades come from cramming,<br>which actually includes puzzle solving, that too is a trick.</p>
  <p>You can paint, program, compose, write, rhyme, sing, sculpt, build, and that is proof of knowledge,<br>a test, just pushes out those who won’t perform for a grade.</p>
  <p>Jobs know that colleges don’t do anything, they grill the students with insulting interviews,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svCYbkS0Sjk">questions that they themselves only pretend to grasp</a>.</p>
  <p>They largely do it to overwhelm and dominate a student,<br>an interview is getting everyone accept the lowest pay possible.</p>

  <p>The difference between a person’s natural curiosity about a subject that tickles them,<br>and being threatened by being held back or by getting bad grades is enormous.</p>
  <p>Threatening a student into obedience, prevents them from learning,<br>though that means little compared to the fact that the use of standardized curricula...</p>
  <p>Is a total misunderstanding, or fantasy of education,<br>even if the teacher does break a student into obedience they still can’t learn.</p>
  <p>They will not build a coherent picture of a subject,<br>they will only memorize what is going to be on the test.</p>
  <p>The students who would argue this point, simply forget,<br>how much more they would have learned without the interference of school.</p>
  <p>They are in fact self education, but they would do so much better,<br>if their education was about Knowledge, and not the GPA, and chances of getting into brand name schools or jobs.</p>
  <p>If they spent all that time on real education,<br>they would end up launching startups out of high school, vastly multiplying their knowledge by their own hand.</p>
  <p>Students know that they are forced into pretending just so that they can get at their future,<br>so that nothing stands in their way, real or not, they want as little interference as possible.</p>
  <p>But they lose respect for everyone and everything,<br>because they are forced into pretending, so that they can protect their future.</p>

  <p>Learning for real, is like visiting a new country,<br>you only do the things that you are ready for.</p>
  <p>And after a while,<br>those things will get you ready to navigate other things.</p>
  <p>Being forced into any path, standardized or randomized,<br>is not education, that is just pushing someone into desperation.</p>

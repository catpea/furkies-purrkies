    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I once wanted to be a Judge,<br>but that book changed my opinion about our Criminal Justice System.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I will use my struggle to comprehend what has happened,<br>in this text, to demonstrate how Great Beings like Michelle Alexander change the world.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">How challenges transform us, and transform within us,<br>how they enter stories like this poem, so that they are never forgotten.</div>

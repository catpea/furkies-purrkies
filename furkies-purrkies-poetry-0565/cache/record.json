about our Criminal Justice System.\nI will use my struggle to comprehend what has happened,\nin this text, to demonstrate how Great Beings like Michelle Alexander change the world.\nHow challenges transform us, and transform within us,\nhow they enter stories like this poem, so that they are never forgotten.\nAnd as we grow in wisdom,\nwe will add to the gravity of the situation so that the changes that the world needs will come sooner.\n\nOverall, we can say that you are supposed to bring on an age,\nin which students can trust teachers with real education.\nThis age will result in a massive increase in the global education level,\nthe kids will take care of the rest.\nYou are just as important as the world,\nyou deserve an early retirement, cheerful days, and a happy life.\n\nI am asking you to think in terms of multiple generations,\nno one person should be made to suffer the mistakes of the world.\nYou contributions need “legs” as Loyd Blankenship[2] calls it,\nit is probably an audio book.\nIf you like,\nyou can give speeches like Richard Dawkins[3] or Brene Brown[4].\n\nTo write that book,\nyou need to get at truths in life.\nYou need to arrange them in a coherent network,\nthat will help others understand the world a bit better.\nAs you learn you will become passionate about certain things that move you,\nEcology, Mass Incarceration, Human Rights, Real Education, Real Growing-up.\nThe things that you are most passionate about,\nwith enhance the things that you have learned from other Great Beings.\nWhen you comprehend Indoctrination,\nyou will see that criminals are not really themselves when committing crimes in their youth.\nThey are still deadly, but they are not to be punished, they need a real education,\nas despite the evil things that people do sometimes they are not by choice, but a mix of indoctrination and drugs.\n\nIndoctrination,\nneed not have a designer.\nThe people who first started using an early notion of money, for example,\nnever intended to put the world in poverty.\nPoverty emerged on its own,\nnobody designed it, it is just that people are not yet wise enough, to fix it.\nNeighborhood violence is another emergent indoctrination,\nit is aided by poverty, and the sick idea that nobody can disrespect a person.\nThis idea will drive people to prison,\nand it will persist in prison, making officials think that prisoners are a lost cause.\n\nA person researching these matters is bound to realize that these kids and young people,\nare raised misinformed about the world.\nThis is why crappy police officers say that “criminals are stupid”,\nwhat is actually going on, is that they are living in an alternate reality fueled by broken things.\n\nHere we can see,\nthat the people we sent to prison were not even themselves when committing their crimes.\nA human being that is enabled by real knowledge and resulting wisdom,\nand allowed to grow up without being choked by poverty[5] or devastated by depression[6], will become perfectly beautiful.\nThe people we call criminals, victims of indoctrination,\nthe stuff clouding their judgment just emerged out of poverty, lack of education, desperation, fear, hunger, loneliness, harm and hurt.\nPrisons are places that punish and harm even more[7],\nthis is not what people who were not acting of their own volition need.\nThose kinds of people need to be unindoctrinated,\nthey need to be brought into our world, into our reality.\n\nIf you were to write such a book speaking about criminals as victims of indoctrination,\nit would up in the hands of inmates, prison officials, guards, politicians.\nAnd small changes would begin to happen,\nas more and more people would see that we’ve been sending our children to prison due to our own blindness, and lack of foresight.\n\nSuch a book would not just influence prisons,\nbut add to the gravity of all other good changes that are queued-up in the world.\nOn this case you would have two types of changes,\nhelping inmates out of their alien world, and and preventing people from ending up in prisons.\nDealing with existing inmates,\nwhich would require converting prisons to schools in the hope of undoing their indoctrination.\nAnd prevention, which attacks the indoctrination it self,\nthis adds gravity to universal basic income programs, and to real education programs such as Will Richardson hints on[8] and changes that Michelle Alexander[9], Kandice Sumner[10] and Duncan Campbell[11]\n\nBreak away from all that you know, and reject fake education,\nand begin learning for real from hundreds or even thousands of the wisest books-and-narrated-books you can find at your library.\nSearch for entire lifetimes of knowledge and wisdom,\nlook for adventures, biographies, storytellers, philosophers.\nAnd become a Independent Great Being,\nbecause the thing that you need to do, lies just past the tipping point between your Wisdom and your Greatness.\n \nReferences\n[1]:

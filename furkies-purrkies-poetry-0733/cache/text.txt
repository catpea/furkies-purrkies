Our greatest inventions,
have been nothing short of our most beautiful poetry.
And so I dreamed up a museum,
and entered to see most magnificent works of art.
Each one was priced at,
3.5 million dollars which is very little.
As these were works of art,
that have not yet been created.
Even so it is more than enough,
that when bought...
The artist will receive,
100 dollars per day for life.
Eventually creating a work of art or science,
worth much more.

Living a life unconstrained by the madness of poverty,
by the leash that holds us all back.
The art from places where poverty was hardest,
was bought out first.
The elder people who did most of the buying,
knew that they were purchasing poverty.
But the students never saw the bad,
they didn't see much good...
They just couldn't imagine,
why a child should be cursed by poverty.
Why hold a mind back,
why hold the advancement of human kind hostage.

The sunflowers flourished,
and a cultural change arose as a direct result...
Of purchasing art,
from the museum of the future.
The students saw how strange we were,
how always on the brink of war.
How poverty,
wouldn't let us be.

The buyers knew the future couldn't be betrayed,
by the children who grew up unafraid.
And they build, of my dear they built,
without a hint of greed or guilt.
And they took an extra day,
waiting until Sunday...
To activate not a blank-bank but a Museum Of Art,
with a red symbol of a heart.
Where each and every student; on the first day school,
filed for a card as a rule.

One hundred dollars a day,
to keep poverty away.
If you can comprehend, if you can hold a pencil in your hand,
then your poverty is at its end.
Cross whatever borders call to you,
and study and learn, and expand your view.
May we never go back to the dark ages again,
may our dealings be more humane.

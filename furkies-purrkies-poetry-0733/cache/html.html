  <p>Our greatest inventions,<br>have been nothing short of our most beautiful poetry.</p>
  <p>And so I dreamed up a museum,<br>and entered to see most magnificent works of art.</p>
  <p>Each one was priced at,<br>3.5 million dollars which is very little.</p>
  <p>As these were works of art,<br>that have not yet been created.</p>
  <p>Even so it is more than enough,<br>that when bought...</p>
  <p>The artist will receive,<br>100 dollars per day for life.</p>
  <p>Eventually creating a work of art or science,<br>worth much more.</p>

  <p>Living a life unconstrained by the madness of poverty,<br>by the leash that holds us all back.</p>
  <p>The art from places where poverty was hardest,<br>was bought out first.</p>
  <p>The elder people who did most of the buying,<br>knew that they were purchasing poverty.</p>
  <p>But the students never saw the bad,<br>they didn't see much good...</p>
  <p>They just couldn't imagine,<br>why a child should be cursed by poverty.</p>
  <p>Why hold a mind back,<br>why hold the advancement of human kind hostage.</p>

  <p>The sunflowers flourished,<br>and a cultural change arose as a direct result...</p>
  <p>Of purchasing art,<br>from the museum of the future.</p>
  <p>The students saw how strange we were,<br>how always on the brink of war.</p>
  <p>How poverty,<br>wouldn't let us be.</p>

  <p>The buyers knew the future couldn't be betrayed,<br>by the children who grew up unafraid.</p>
  <p>And they build, of my dear they built,<br>without a hint of greed or guilt.</p>
  <p>And they took an extra day,<br>waiting until Sunday...</p>
  <p>To activate not a blank-bank but a Museum Of Art,<br>with a red symbol of a heart.</p>
  <p>Where each and every student; on the first day school,<br>filed for a card as a rule.</p>

  <p>One hundred dollars a day,<br>to keep poverty away.</p>
  <p>If you can comprehend, if you can hold a pencil in your hand,<br>then your poverty is at its end.</p>
  <p>Cross whatever borders call to you,<br>and study and learn, and expand your view.</p>
  <p>May we never go back to the dark ages again,<br>may our dealings be more humane.</p>

There are as many directions,
as there are artists.

And each painting is a gateway,
to a new story that must be told.

It isn't just the story though,
but also how it is told.

Be it night and moonlight,
or mountains and mist.

Or maybe sunlight,
on a cheerful face.

The language of the story,
is the style of art.

---

A photo cannot tell as much,
but it can serve as a start.

A photo is a friend to art,
a sturdy foundation to built on.

---

To truly appreciate,
__all__ the languages of art.

But would need to paint a single photo,
in all the styles.

From sunny faces,
all the way out to drops of rain in a storm.

In truth,
there is such beauty to capture.

That rarely will an artist have time,
to speak in all the languages.

---

But, we can be sure,
all artists improve.

And expression by expression,
language by language.

Though through a different painting,
each time.

Their language becomes finer,
and it may never settle on a height.

And other artists may build,
on top.

---

There may never be enough
galleries, or shows.

To capture all the steps,
of a language.

We only see just the art,
that the world had room for.

---

If you take to art...
publish your journals, as well.

And know that in time,
no artist is ever alone.

Show the world,
the journey you took.

So that no step is lost,
and so that others may follow.

  <p>There are as many directions,<br>as there are artists.</p>
  <p>And each painting is a gateway,<br>to a new story that must be told.</p>
  <p>It isn't just the story though,<br>but also how it is told.</p>
  <p>Be it night and moonlight,<br>or mountains and mist.</p>
  <p>Or maybe sunlight,<br>on a cheerful face.</p>
  <p>The language of the story,<br>is the style of art.</p>

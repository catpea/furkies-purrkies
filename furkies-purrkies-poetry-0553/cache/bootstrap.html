    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Long ago, I have discovered that revealing the fraud of modern education,<br>and having crazy amounts of fun while learning it for real, is one and the same!</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Before I babble any further,<br>I wanted to share a program I just made for all of you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can find it at <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/catpea/sketches/">https://editor.p5js.org/catpea/sketches/</a><br>under the name math-101</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And on github at:<br><a href="https://github.com/catpea/p5">https://github.com/catpea/p5</a></div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is almost exactly the same kind of program I wrote,<br>when I stopped learning in school because of bullies, and being accused of copying when I was writing my own.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What you will discover in this program is coordinates of 0,0,<br>in the lower left hand corner - as it should be.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And a tree with four generations of branches,<br>red, green, blue, magenta.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The code is plainly spelled out, not in a loop, not in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUI5Tsl2JpY">function</a>,<br>just friendly computer math that solves it self.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then at the end, when branches get too small,<br>I do make a loop, to show you what a loop looks like - and to finish off the top of the tree.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This tree is very special,<br>because it represents plain math, the math we use every day.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But to fix the branches of the tree,<br>to make them more artistic and realistic like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QiPFmIMxFc">Bret Victor’s Inventing on Principle</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QC42w0npwQ">We can’t just use plain numbers, we need to upgrade them</a>,<br>to something more capacious.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The numbers we use every day are called Scalar,<br>the upgraded numbers are called Vectors.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Vectors store value called magnitude plus an angle,<br>and this is what we need for our tree.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We need to say this branch is 20 pixels,<br>but at a 15, or 30, or 45 degree angle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We can't do this with Scalar numbers,<br>because when you have things at an angle they can’t be calculated with subtraction and addition, the tree branches wouldn't be the same length.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So we need to leg go of x and y,<br>and focus on line length which will be the same for all the branches at a particular level, and angle which will differ for all the branches.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Look at a real tree,<br>branches in the middle are almost of the same length, and branches at the ends are very short.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors.html">Any source of information on the subject of vectors will give you all the formulas</a>,<br>they are all very easy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But, there is a bit more to it,<br>because angles, mean circle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That’s where all the PI comes from,<br>and the consistent lengths of a set of branches, is just the circle radius.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We choose angles,<br>because that’s how branches grow on a tree.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And angles are best handled by means of circles,<br>and what is really cool, is that a radius of a circle makes for a fantastic representation of the length of a branch on a particular height.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To angle our virtual branch,<br>we draw a line at an angle starting in the middle of the circle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At this point,<br>we arrive at another area of mathematics, trigonometry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhd9FXYdf4s">Trigonometry is just relationships of lines moving around a circle</a>,<br>this is never explained correctly, and never given any real context.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is what our tree represents,<br>a need for Vectors, Vector Operations, and the underlying Trigonometry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I know that trigonometry makes people sad,<br>it represents failed tests, sometimes tears.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But trigonometry is just relationships between,<br>lines, triangles, and circles.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Do not be sad,<br>get mad.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://gist.github.com/jgphilpott/1378cc2cccde6d65c5fb2b6111b5a98f">Because trigonometry, is less than 50 lines of code</a>,<br>it is just that it has been mishandled by schools.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The only big thing about trigonometry,<br>is that people studied it, and shared formulas, and knowledge about it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As a result we can just use their more general formulas,<br>rather than inventing our own.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Our own would just be a smaller version that only deals with representing branches for our tree.<br>Inventing the formula would use a triangle, just like trigonometry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I hope the tree will call to you,<br>I hope the fact that I just used scalar subtraction and addition instead of cool vectors will call to you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I don’t know what this memorization nonsense that schools are doing is,<br>but it is not math, if anything they are destroying math, they are not teaching it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What I just showed you is the math,<br>it is interesting, and colorful.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And it can make us dream about generating infinite forests of unique trees,<br>and why stop at trees we can add birds to the trees, and generative squires, and little chipmunks in various poses,<br>an odd bunny here and there, and two deer with universally unique antler configurations, and why not a cat or too... they always seem to be everywhere...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">...put a lion in there...</div>

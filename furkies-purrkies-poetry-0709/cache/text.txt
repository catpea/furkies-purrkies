It would be so nice if we could hope to repair High School,
but there is too much paperwork, and far too many broken promises.
The minds of the Students and the younger generations,
are far too precious to even consider staining with ineffective education.

In this text I use the word talent,
the way it should be used.
I indicate a thing, that is to be learned and proud of,
not the myth of being born with some special ability.

For example, computer Game Making Talent can cover most of High School Math,
and Building Math Visualizations and Puzzles will get the rest.
However, not everyone will be interested in making games,
some people may prefer Electronics or even Nerf Gun-turrets.
This will cover a smaller portion of Math,
and that is OK.

What we cannot do is use something as off-topic as the,
"Grade 9-12 Mathematics Program[1]".
Which contains categories that are just not relevant to anything,
Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics-and-Probability, and how to pretend to learn without taking anything away[2].

The only decent explanation the Grade 9-12 Mathematics Program builders can conjure up,
is "Math helps us have better problem-solving skills[3]".

But these isolated, abstract, reduced to the bare bone, insipid subject divisions have to go,
because they only force students into memorization, and produce stupid politicians that don't know math.
Passing standardized tests,
is a useless talent.

Taking to programming, with a long exploration of p5.js[4],
and then Command Line Programs, HTTPS Servers (a very simple and cool thing)...
Databases (which are simpler than excel),
Reactive Frameworks (React, VueJs, Svelte), and finally cross-platform User Interface Design.
Does not just result in getting a job,
but slowly assembling a small startup[5], or a range of creative side projects.

Mathematics as it is taught in High School,
is very weak compared to programming that can set a person free from poverty.
Mathematics taught right,
on a collaborative Wikipedia-like P5.js driven 9-12 Mathematics Program delivered as an interactive game.
It is fine, except for the fact that a more meaningful education,
also helps people out of poverty.
Subject based education,
is an insult to the younger generation.
And in fact oils the cogs of the machinery that strips them off their savings[6]
and forces them into taking out unforgivable student loans[7]..

Incompetent politicians, lukewarm teachers, and irrelevant lectures,
only combine to halt humanity's progress.
When we stand still, and uneducated,
we get taken advantage of.
For two thousand years it has been know that lead is bad[8],
but we put it in our gasoline[9], even though there was an ever so slightly expensive alternative that was safer.
This pattern continues with Neonicotinoids[10],
continued emission of CFCs[11], and PFAS[12], which you should already consider, when moving[13].

A talent based education,
simple reflects the way we learn in the real world.
A subject based education,
is just easy to cram for, and teaches little.

We are better, than Using schools as baby sitters,
and tolerating ineffective education.
We are better than acting as if politicians can fix it,
all the while pushing students into debt.
It is time to create a number of open computer based education systems,
that aim to deliver real results for a change.
Schools, where students expand their curiosities and talents, one meaningful project at a time[14],
art and science is everywhere, it is best studied in context of something meaningful.

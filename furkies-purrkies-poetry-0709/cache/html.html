  <p>It would be so nice if we could hope to repair High School,<br>but there is too much paperwork, and far too many broken promises.</p>
  <p>The minds of the Students and the younger generations,<br>are far too precious to even consider staining with ineffective education.</p>

  <p>In this text I use the word talent,<br>the way it should be used.</p>
  <p>I indicate a thing, that is to be learned and proud of,<br>not the myth of being born with some special ability.</p>

  <p>For example, computer Game Making Talent can cover most of High School Math,<br>and Building Math Visualizations and Puzzles will get the rest.</p>
  <p>However, not everyone will be interested in making games,<br>some people may prefer Electronics or even Nerf Gun-turrets.</p>
  <p>This will cover a smaller portion of Math,<br>and that is OK.</p>

  <p>What we cannot do is use something as off-topic as the,<br>"<a href="https://www.waynecountyschools.org/Grade9-12MathematicsProgramOverview.aspx">Grade 9-12 Mathematics Program</a>".</p>
  <p>Which contains categories that are just not relevant to anything,<br>Number and Quantity, Algebra, Functions, Geometry, and Statistics-and-Probability, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts">how to pretend to learn without taking anything away</a>.</p>

  <p>The only decent explanation the Grade 9-12 Mathematics Program builders can conjure up,<br>is "<a href="https://www.piday.org/10-reasons-why-math-is-important-in-life/">Math helps us have better problem-solving skills</a>".</p>

  <p>But these isolated, abstract, reduced to the bare bone, insipid subject divisions have to go,<br>because they only force students into memorization, and produce stupid politicians that don't know math.</p>

  <p>Mathematics as it is taught in High School,<br>is very weak compared to programming that can set a person free from poverty.</p>
  <p>Mathematics taught right,<br>on a collaborative Wikipedia-like P5.js driven 9-12 Mathematics Program delivered as an interactive game.</p>
  <p>It is fine, except for the fact that a more meaningful education,<br>also helps people out of poverty.</p>
  <p>Subject based education,<br>is an insult to the younger generation.</p>
  <p>And in fact oils the cogs of the machinery that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUanS5OWy_k">strips them off their savings</a><br>and forces them into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5o1w5TlCaE">taking out unforgivable student loans</a>..</p>

  <p>We are better, than Using schools as baby sitters,<br>and tolerating ineffective education.</p>
  <p>We are better than acting as if politicians can fix it,<br>all the while pushing students into debt.</p>
  <p>It is time to create a number of open computer based education systems,<br>that aim to deliver real results for a change.</p>
  <p>Schools, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/circuits/projects/">where students expand their curiosities and talents, one meaningful project at a time</a>,<br>art and science is everywhere, it is best studied in context of something meaningful.</p>

  <p>That schools are broken is one terrible thing,<br>you are meant to stand far above that.</p>
  <p>You are meant to be more than just self educating,<br>you are meant to be powering up, all that is all too human.</p>
  <p>It doesn't even matter what is coming,<br>you are to learn great things as a function of being human.</p>
  <p>You are meant to become a great being,<br>you are meant to move mountains.</p>

  <p>A world that does not emphasize greatness,<br>will become a world of actors, performers, pretenders.</p>
  <p>Those kinds of people are not well,<br>they just put on a proud face and go with the flow.</p>
  <p>Remember that being manipulated by an actor,<br>is imperceptible - that is the definition of manipulation.</p>
  <p>I think all that liars want is not to be caught,<br>hence the energetic effort at projecting leadership.</p>
  <p>Real leadership is about preventing dead ends,<br>not waiting until all but desperate choices are available.</p>
  <p>A world that does not emphasize greatness,<br>will lack the necessary wisdom to build schools, to provide real safety.</p>
  <p>Oh, Humanity comes together,<br>and more often than not fixes everything at the very last second...</p>
  <p>But that is not the way it is done,<br>foresight and comprehension, wisdom and greatness is how it is done.</p>
  <p>Last second prevention can fail sometimes,<br>and it is not who we are anyway.</p>

  <p>On the other end, we can't hope to fix things by means of destruction,<br>we learn that from the hydra that grows two heads in place of the one that was cut off.</p>
  <p>In short,<br>destruction magnifies hate, and we are creators not destroyers.</p>
  <p>We have to set kindergarten level ideas aside,<br>and understand that wisdom and greatness are the true forces of change.</p>
  <p>They are forces of creation, of bringing understanding,<br>of setting people free from prisons whose walls they cannot see.</p>
  <p>Borders do not make humanity better or more stable,<br>if anything they are used to mislead and harm the most vulnerable.</p>

  <p>Humanity, in reality has no rulers,<br>it is too vast, too noble, and far too collectively wise.</p>
  <p>We have people who take care of paperwork,<br>so that we can take care of our lives.</p>
  <p>Those are not leaders,<br>they should not decide on matters that steer humanity, they just need to take care of paperwork.</p>
  <p>Only Humanity can set its course,<br>and we need to understand that.</p>
  <p>We are one family, and we all have to rise,<br>and we have to look far into distant futures.</p>
  <p>Our most important duty,<br>is to make sure the little ones have a great and cheerful future.</p>

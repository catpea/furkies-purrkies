illusion.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The illusion of education by means of memorization and mediocrity, and cramming, and pretending,</p>\n  <p>because, again, that only creates a surface for big fat white lice to feed on the future of this world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We have to to explain to this obviously intelligent individual,</p>\n  <p>that school is only holding him back.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It will come as shock at first, but that is not such a bad thing,</p>\n  <p>because this shock will awaken a healthy skepticism that they are likely to employ in all their decision making.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Kids are are protecting a system of education,</p>\n  <p>that did nothing for us.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Everything up to high school is working out nicely,</p>\n  <p>it is when the subject divisions and tests that force memorization are introduced that education ends, and pretending begins.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Children don&apos;t pretend because they want to be actors,</p>\n  <p>but because it is impossible to graduate with a good GPA and still learn for real.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A teacher would make a fair point here and state that they have to rely on

<p>While they already know much of what they will teach,</p>\n  <p>they still need structure.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But, like with that intelligent student that we have to say no to,</p>\n  <p>we must say no to the teachers as well.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No one but the student is allowed to structure the material,</p>\n  <p>it must be structured in a way that keeps them going, keeps them interested and passionate about their next steps.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The new curriculum should be based on a body of knowledge created by all the worlds students,</p>\n  <p>but the path must honor their uniqueness and existing creativity, must match their existing knowledge, and pace of learning.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div

are still learning life,</p>\n  <p>and in the new schools they will be learning the correct things at the correct pace.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But politicians, do need grades once they begin serving,</p>\n  <p>furthermore the voters should base a lot of their decisions on the unique history of the politician&apos;s education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A decades long open and ongoing history of curiosities and achievements built by a political candidate in the new school,</p>\n  <p>will prevent liars from entering positions that are meant for the true

  "text": "People are tricked into thinking that music theory is required for making music,\nand schools deliver music theory as a single indivisible blob.\n\nWith modern schools focusing on standardized testing,\nschools trick kids into thinking that memorization is a kind of learning.\n\nBut memorization is only about keeping the grade point average high enough,\nfor everyone who works for that school to get paid.\n\nFrom the teacher's perspective,\nthey are doing their job, so that they can get paid.\n\nFrom the student's perspective,\nthey are trying to get good grades to get into good college, and get a good job.\n\nBut, we have to stop and ask,\nis the school teaching, are the children learning?\n\nChildren can't tell the schools are bad for them,\nbecause they do not know enough about life, and they tend to follow directions.\n\nAdults have the same problem with politics,\npoliticians are actors that act just enough to get what they personally want.\n\nIt only takes a few liars to disable a nation,\nbut what we are seeing, is that here are only few honest people there.\n\nFrom the perspective of the politician, they serve their people,\nand it is their job to inspire their trust.\n\nFrom a psychologists perspective,\nthat is lying.\n\nI wonder where all the psychologists are,\nwith each passing decade their rise to their spotlight becomes more and more critical.\n\nMost of us hear \"C Major\", or \"C Minor\",\nthat is just code for saying that we will start with the note C, and then focus on a pattern of notes named Major.\n\nA scale is,\na pallet of 8 colors that the musician has chosen to compose with.\n\nIn painting colors are super important,\nyou really want to get the right yellow and orange to paint a sunrise, you have to mix them just right.\n\nAnd just imagine the importance of colors when it comes to painting a portrait,\na starting artist may wish for a pre-mixed set of colors for just painting portrait - it sounds as useful as it is.\n\nThat is what a scale is,\na selection of pre-mixed notes so that a person can focus on making melodies.\n\nThat is the very least we need to take away from music class,\nthat is all it takes to give us the ability to express ourselves with music.\n\nIf children are forced to take tests, that obscure this gift of self-expression,\nits simplicity, glory, reward, empowerment, then they are being cheated.\n\nIf someone was to sit you down at a piano,\nthat had a knob that would let you choose from all the scales and highlight the keys of a selected scale.\n\nYou would immediately find a selection of notes that would match your feelings,\nand begin composing.\n\nListen, this is true, you only get eight keys,\nyou can only go up and down, and at a pace that fits your feeling, there is nothing difficult about this.\n\nMore than that, you would be playing the soul of the song,\nwith sounds that connect with your feelings.\n\nAnd then you would be called to add another layer,\na melody to bring light and wisdom to that world.\n\nAnd again, if we continue tolerating politicians that split their heads in two,\none being I must act to appear amazing, and two being I must take care of my own business first - the world will not grow.\n\nWorld's politicians bifurcating is probably to a considerable degree,\ninfluenced by the in-authenticity they are forced to participate in schools.\n\nWe are scaring the children that if they don't memorize,\nthey will be held back and called stupid.\n\nWe are preventing children from learning,\nby sending them to memorization and meat processing plants.\n\nHumanity will not progress,\nif this continues.\n\nThe saddest thing of all is that children think they are learning\nby passing all the tests, they call it learning, they know it as learning.\n\nIf memorization is ever taken away from them,\nthey will protest that education is being stolen.\n\nSome kids do figure out they can't be creative,\nand must instead perform this ritual of memorization - I think most of them still think of the ritual as learning.\n\nWhen other kids hear of this ritual sacrifice, they see it as madness,\nin their minds it sounds like you can't be creative after you get good grades from music class.\n\nChildren are trying to figure this out,\nbut they can't, they don't have enough experience.\n\nTo the person who senses that they must sacrifice their unique creativity to get good grades,\nwe must say, \"If you do that, then our world will die.\".\n\nWhat makes a person unique and creative, must be protected and developed,\ndestroying that, with stress, threats of being held back, creates the surface for liars to thrive in.\n\nA liar is after all, is a perfectly uneducated and hollow individual,\nskilled in in getting everything, anyway.\n\nTo the person who says that learning music or science in school,\ngives us the ability to be creative.\n\nWe have to say, no,\nwe have to end this illusion.\n\nThe illusion of education by means of memorization and mediocrity, and cramming, and pretending,\nbecause, again, that only creates a surface for big fat white lice to feed on the future of this world.\n\nWe have to to explain to this obviously intelligent individual,\nthat school is only holding him back.\n\nIt will come as shock at first, but that is not such a bad thing,\nbecause this shock will awaken a healthy skepticism that they are likely to employ in all their decision making.\n\nKids are are protecting a system of education,\nthat did nothing for us.\n\nEverything up to high school is working out nicely,\nit is when the subject divisions and tests that force memorization are introduced that education ends, and pretending begins.\n\nChildren don't pretend because they want to be actors,\nbut because it is impossible to graduate with a good GPA and still learn for real.\n\nA teacher would make a fair point here and state that they have to rely on a separate entity to build the curriculum,\nit does make sense that a teacher should receive help with structuring their lectures and semesters.\n\nWhile they already know much of what they will teach,\nthey still need structure.\n\nBut, like with that intelligent student that we have to say no to,\nwe must say no to the teachers as well.\n\nNo one but the student is allowed to structure the material,\nit must be structured in a way that keeps them going, keeps them interested and passionate about their next steps.\n\nThe new curriculum should be based on a body of knowledge created by all the worlds students,\nbut the path must honor their uniqueness and existing creativity, must match their existing knowledge, and pace of learning.\n\nBoth politics and education can be greatly improved with interactive visualizations and info-graphics,\njust like a student should know where their path will take them, a voter should be able to see and comprehend the results of their vote.\n\nStudents should not be graded, they are still learning life,\nand in the new schools they will be learning the correct things at the correct pace.\n\nBut politicians, do need grades once they begin serving,\nfurthermore the voters should base a lot of their decisions on the unique history of the politician's education.\n\nA decades long open and ongoing history of curiosities and achievements built by a political candidate in the new school,\nwill prevent liars from entering positions that are meant for the true leaders of future generations.\n\nA musical scale is just a selection of a few colors that the musician pre-selected, to paint their feelings with,\nin a song they sat down to compose.\n\nA real school,\nwould make you a musician in the course of a day.\n\nWe are meant to learn for real, knowledge that results in wisdom,\nand wisdom, that if we choose, will take us to greatness.\n\nLet us take no sides when it comes to Future of Humanity,\nwe are but temporary keepers of this world as it belongs to all the future generations - there is no place for in-authenticity here.\n\nLet us say no, to make believe education,\nand let us say no to uneducated actors in roles of self serving leadership.\n\nLet us honor all the future generations,\nby creating real schools that provide meaningful and personalized education.\n\n\n[all the scales]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_scales_and_modes",

You are not ordinary, nor are you standard, nor should you ever be standardized in any way.
you are a sacred being, and you are meant to bring more light to the word.
Be careful,
do not allow anybody to take away your real knowledge, your real education.
It is all too easy to fake the teaching of knowledge by tricking students into thinking that they can just do it with memorization,
schools thrive on it.

Schools push you into memorization,
and then use your shame-of-not-knowing-for-real, keep you quiet.
People who benefit from protecting schools and the fake education,
will not have a problem cherry picking data to prove that fake schools are excellent at teaching.
There will be promises, incentives, careers,
but in their golden age, students who trusted, yet again, will be, left in want for meaning.

Your education is too important,
and is meant to be far too unique to benefit from organized education.
Just the fact alone that schools do little to distinguish functional knowledge from rote memorization,
shows that schools are only interested in doing as little as possible.
And simply for the purpose of retaining accreditation to stay stay in business,
so that all the school employees take their paychecks home.

There may not even be an easy way to introduce a real test,
to show everyone that standardized education is fake education.
Most people will have to fight to show that they know to get that next promotion,
to keep their job, and not to be ashamed of not knowing basic subjects.
Or teachers can simply come up with the excuse, of not being able to test some fundamental of mathematics,
because it was simply not covered, or; is yet to be covered by university education that not all maybe interested in.

Good liars, make good money, by working in a territory where even their victims will protect the lie,
and above all working within a system of complete deniability where nothing can change[1].
This would be somewhat OK, if this was some industry, or financial sector,
smarter investors would stay away from it.
But this is the Business of Knowledge,
this is the business of Wisdom.
Education deals with the fuel,
that ignites Human Greatness.

There are; things more important than Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,
they are all your most brilliant thoughts, deepest integrities, most private treasures, and your very decision making.
They too are influenced,
by what we know, our greatest treasures, can be warped and sometimes stolen by fake education.
What we know influences who we are,
so we really have to make sure that the things we know are authentic, true, real.

We must not trust anybody with our own education,
it is far too dangerous, it is actually careless.
Do net let people trick you into a fake education and switch real knowledge for fake one, cutting you away from your Wisdom and Greatness,
so that they can pinch away a little bit of money from a lot of uneducated people.
You are meant to become a Royalty,
you are meant to Enlighten the World, and push it away, from the mistakes it keeps making.

Humanity has invented books,
which are a way of transferring precious hard earned knowledge that must never be lost.
The top 1,000 books written by all the world's authors, from many nations, across many cultural and political epochs and revolutions,
especially those that admire one another in high esteem, will give you a safe, and well-balanced view of the world.

The type of knowledge that life changing books contain,
has the ability to enhance and-build-up our minds, help us grow-up higher, and become wiser, onward to Greatness.
This powerful mind enhancing power, inherited from countless lives committed to Authentic Knowledge, Meaningful Wisdom and World Improving Greatness,
is for you, it is your treasure.

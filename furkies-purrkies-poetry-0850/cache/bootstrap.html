    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think all people can write computer programs,<br>it is just that programming languages are too simple and raw.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This approach uses Flow Based programming,<br>prefixed by an Event Listener.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A really good example of flow based programming and processing is your mouse...<br>when you move it across a web page with a Mouse Event Listener.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here, you are sending a lot of XY coordinates, to the Mouse Move Event Listener,<br>you can process them by filtering and transforming the data in the stream.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You could filter out all data, until the mouse is pressed,<br>and then let the user draw, by placing a trail of colorful pixels as those X,Y coordinates.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Allow me to describe it,<br>couple more times.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">First you have a program that drops all X,Y coordinate objects,<br>unless the mouse also reports being pressed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then you have a second program on the stream,<br>and it just picks a random color for a pixel.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You don’t have to check if a mouse is pressed,<br>because none of the packets when a mouse isn’t pressed reach here.</div>

  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We have two programs sitting on top of this stream,<br>a packet dropper or filter, and pixel painter or random color pen.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the stream it self starts with an Even Listener,<br>that gets the X,Y coordinates from the mouse.</div>
  </div>

<div class="card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow">
  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The big deal about this is that this can be visually represented,<br>with a circle for even listener, line for the stream of X,Y coordinates...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And a couple of squares,<br>representing the filter and the pen.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">More than that, even before the graphical representation,<br>this can be easily spelled out in text.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And in fact this program should be first structured,<br>in a plain text document.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The document can be fed into Cytoscape.js based,<br>visual program representational graph.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The text it self, is just title for name of the program,<br>declaration of needed variables such as useRand omColorPen = true...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And paragraphs of text separated by space,<br>here if there is a branching statement.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The paragraph may describe to what listener the stream should flow,<br>or just specify the name.</div>

<div class="card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow">
  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Finally, it is very important, that free text is used to describe what happens on the line,<br>what the filter is doing, or what the pen should do.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because this allows describing program functionality that does not yet exist,<br>exactly like in Behavior Driven development.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In the end each paragraph of text,<br>is sent through a code generator.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Where program chunks that already exist,<br>the user will connect them to the paragraph.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Where functionality calls for programmers,<br>the code generator will generate Unit Tests and post a bounty.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The stream based approach as I have described here,<br>is not just for efficiency but for readability by examining large visual program maps.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The shocking part, of describing code with paragraphs of text,<br>is not about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">Literate Programming</a> but rather mobile phones.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This environment allows for serious programming,<br>by just typing text into boxes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here the developer begins to create a valuable description of a program, already on day one,<br>and simple search will list all the existing modules related to the paragraph the developer is describing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">All you need to start writing programs is a slightly enriched text box, and just as soon as you start typing;<br>a map of the streams and branches will snap into existence.</div>

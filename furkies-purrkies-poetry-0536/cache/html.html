  <p>I took the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4">Blender Doughnut Tutorial</a> today,<br>and the first level is not bad at all - Keyboard Shortcuts and Little Buttons.</p>
  <p>I have been looking into Blender as a backup to FreeCAD,<br>but also it is good for the soul to develop patience for special need programs.</p>
  <p>I have spent a little bit more time in Inkscape, a 2D program,<br>it has very good features.</p>
  <p>And I have also spent a moment thinking about paper,<br>as it is reasonable to draw a design on paper.</p>
  <p>It will require conversion to SVG,<br>and in some cases can be used in a 3D sculpting program.</p>

  <p>My initial designs were squares,<br>the latest design, is me drawing with a line tool.</p>
  <p>Not a free hand tool,<br>but a tool that draws straight lines.</p>
  <p>Now, by pressing the control key,<br>you are only allowed to make angles in 15 degree increments.</p>
  <p>The designs almost design themselves,<br>this is within <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Inkscape+tutorial">Inkscape</a>.</p>
  <p>It is a tool,<br>that prevents crooked doodles.</p>

  <p>The latest design that is shown in the title picture,<br>is mostly a random arrangement of 2D shapes.</p>
  <p>It is a study,<br>in what a more deliberate design process would feel like.</p>
  <p>Inkscape in particular has helpful tools for arranging objects evenly,<br>evenly distributing spaces between objects.</p>
  <p>When a 2D design is imported to FreeCAD, it can be converted to a sketch,<br>but the sketch will need hundreds of constraints, 700 in this case.</p>
  <p>But the program demands can be ignored,<br>so as long as all the objects that will later become holes by means of Boolean Cuts, are solid paths.</p>
  <p>I had them set as lines and FreeCAD would get confused,<br>a hole in the SVG will not translate to a hole in FreeCAD, it will become an object that needs to go through the Boolean Cut process.</p>
  <p>Which is where Blender comes in,<br>blenders ability to convert an SVG into a 3D object is a matter of setting the imported SVG object extrusion value under Geometry,</p>
  <p>In my case here it is 2mm,<br>Blender can export the object, but in case of TinkerCAD it must be scaled a 1,000 times during export.</p>
  <p>Blender's default scene is in meters,<br>it is just easier to enter 1000 during export then mess with the settings.</p>

  <p>By using Blender with a Slicer that generates gcode that 3D printers and other machines understand,<br>it is hard to see any limitations to any kind of design.</p>
  <p>FreeCAD seems to be a more serious program,<br>it is meant to create tools and parts.</p>
  <p>Blender, takes the concept to the maximum,<br>and far beyond manufacturing.</p>

  <p>There was a cartoon that I watched a few times when I was little,<br>it was called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TdvUcVZFWs">Enchanted Pencil</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/7TdvUcVZFWs?t=228">Three minutes fifty seconds into the cartoon</a>,<br>a Gnome appears for no reason, and hands the main character a magical pencil.</p>
  <p>The boy then copies a tattoo on a nearby sleeping admiral,<br>and the drawing magically appears in reality.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0EfPcc6O6k">3D pens that extrude the same kind of filament that 3D printers use do exist</a>,<br>but making 3D drawings free hand is a different process.</p>
  <p>It is very artistic through, and the filament work does smooth out with a hot knife and some filling,<br>it is just that one can't make perfect copies.</p>

  <p>But that is what 3D modeling of real world objects feels like to me,<br>it is like using a magical pencil.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/stories/wallets">It seems almost everyone is using wallets to refine their work flow</a>,<br>it certainly makes for an interesting hobby.</p>
  <p>I bought a little CR2030 battery,<br>and while it was still in packaging I pierced it with a pin and slid in a 5mm led.</p>
  <p>It has been on all afternoon,<br>I can tell the green LED needs more juice.</p>
  <p>I just jabbed in a red one in there and it looks fantastic,<br>all it takes is a pair of calipers to create a useless wallet feature, that will make all the difference.</p>
  <p>I've noticed many wallet designs have little little ports for MicroSD cards,<br>and even card adapters.</p>

  <p>I continue using elastic string during my initial research,<br>that's what the round holes are for in the title image.</p>
  <p>But I've notices people using rubber washers or bands to create simple hinges,<br>and a handful of designs takes that extra step and feature an actual mechanical hinge.</p>
  <p>Creating a proper hinge is simple math,<br>and a hinge can be printed per-assembled which is yet another fantastic tangent.</p>

  <p>My favorite idea in the world of wallets,<br>is of course Generative Wallets.</p>
  <p>A program would follow simple logic to outline an SVG design,<br>it would randomly choose from ideas about each of the corners, rounded, exposed, square with an extrusion, etc.</p>
  <p>With a handful of randomly set parameters,<br>the wallet design would emerge out of random chaos.</p>
  <p>Moreover once could display nine wallets,<br>and allow the user to choose which of the features look most fetching.</p>
  <p>And then re generate nine new designs,<br>that select for what the features previously picked.</p>
  <p>Borrowing from the process of evolution,<br>though I prefer non-interactive product generation, myself.</p>

  <p>In closing, I want to hold this up as an example of Real Education,<br>something that can be learned in 7th grade, and mastered by high school.</p>
  <p>Even though this is just printing,<br>it is also a lesson in business.</p>
  <p>It shows a young mind that there is a small gap between an original invention,<br>and an online store.</p>
  <p>High school graduation, should end with all the students being equipped with an independent business,<br>most of the time it would be multiple co-founders, as it is easier - but that is not the rule.</p>
  <p>And here the students would see that they don't need to graduate into more debt and more poverty,<br>but rather have something that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts">pushes all the fears of post-graduation back</a>.</p>

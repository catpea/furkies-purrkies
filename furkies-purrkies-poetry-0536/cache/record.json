  "text": "I took the Blender Doughnut Tutorial[1] today,\nand the first level is not bad at all - Keyboard Shortcuts and Little Buttons.\nI have been looking into Blender as a backup to FreeCAD,\nbut also it is good for the soul to develop patience for special need programs.\nI have spent a little bit more time in Inkscape, a 2D program,\nit has very good features.\nAnd I have also spent a moment thinking about paper,\nas it is reasonable to draw a design on paper.\nIt will require conversion to SVG,\nand in some cases can be used in a 3D sculpting program.\n\nMy initial designs were squares,\nthe latest design, is me drawing with a line tool.\nNot a free hand tool,\nbut a tool that draws straight lines.\nNow, by pressing the control key,\nyou are only allowed to make angles in 15 degree increments.\nThe designs almost design themselves,\nthis is within Inkscape[2].\nIt is a tool,\nthat prevents crooked doodles.\n\nThe latest design that is shown in the title picture,\nis mostly a random arrangement of 2D shapes.\nIt is a study,\nin what a more deliberate design process would feel like.\nInkscape in particular has helpful tools for arranging objects evenly,\nevenly distributing spaces between objects.\nWhen a 2D design is imported to FreeCAD, it can be converted to a sketch,\nbut the sketch will need hundreds of constraints, 700 in this case.\nBut the program demands can be ignored,\nso as long as all the objects that will later become holes by means of Boolean Cuts, are solid paths.\nI had them set as lines and FreeCAD would get confused,\na hole in the SVG will not translate to a hole in FreeCAD, it will become an object that needs to go through the Boolean Cut process.\nWhich is where Blender comes in,\nblenders ability to convert an SVG into a 3D object is a matter of setting the imported SVG object extrusion value under Geometry,\nIn my case here it is 2mm,\nBlender can export the object, but in case of TinkerCAD it must be scaled a 1,000 times during export.\nBlender's default scene is in meters,\nit is just easier to enter 1000 during export then mess with the settings.\n\nBy using Blender with a Slicer that generates gcode that 3D printers and other machines understand,\nit is hard to see any limitations to any kind of design.\nFreeCAD seems to be a more serious program,\nit is meant to create tools and parts.\nBlender, takes the concept to the maximum,\nand far beyond manufacturing.\n\nThere was a cartoon that I watched a few times when I was little,\nit was called Enchanted Pencil[3].\nThree minutes fifty seconds into the cartoon[4],\na Gnome appears for no reason, and hands the main character a magical pencil.\nThe boy then copies a tattoo on a nearby sleeping admiral,\nand the drawing magically appears in reality.\n\n3D pens that extrude the same kind of filament that 3D printers use do exist[5],\nbut making 3D drawings free hand is a different process.\nIt is very artistic through, and the filament work does smooth out with a hot knife and some filling,\nit is just that one can't make perfect copies.\n\nBut that is what 3D modeling of real world objects feels like to me,\nit is like using a magical pencil.\n\nIt seems almost everyone is using wallets to refine their work flow[6],\nit certainly makes for an interesting hobby.\nI bought a little CR2030 battery,\nand while it was still in packaging I pierced it with a pin and slid in a 5mm led.\nIt has been on all afternoon,\nI can tell the green LED needs more juice.\nI just jabbed in a red one in there and it looks fantastic,\nall it takes is a pair of calipers to create a useless wallet feature, that will make all the difference.\nI've noticed many wallet designs have little little ports for MicroSD cards,\nand even card adapters.\n\nI continue using elastic string during my initial research,\nthat's what the round holes are for in the title image.\nBut I've notices people using rubber washers or bands to create simple hinges,\nand a handful of designs takes that extra step and feature an actual mechanical hinge.\nCreating a proper hinge is simple math,\nand a hinge can be printed per-assembled which is yet another fantastic tangent.\n\nMy favorite idea in the world of wallets,\nis of course Generative Wallets.\nA program would follow simple logic to outline an SVG design,\nit would randomly choose from ideas about each of the corners, rounded, exposed, square with an extrusion, etc.\nWith a handful of randomly set parameters,\nthe wallet design would emerge out of random chaos.\nMoreover once could display nine wallets,\nand allow the user to choose which of the features look most fetching.\nAnd then re generate nine new designs,\nthat select for what the features previously picked.\nBorrowing from the process of evolution,\nthough I prefer non-interactive product generation, myself.\n\nIn closing, I want to hold this up as an example of Real Education,\nsomething that can be learned in 7th grade, and mastered by high school.\nEven though this is just printing,\nit is also a lesson in business.\nIt shows a young mind that there is a small gap between an original invention,\nand an online store.\nHigh school graduation, should end with all the students being equipped with an independent business,\nmost of the time it would be multiple co-founders, as it is easier - but that is not the rule.\nAnd here the students would see that they don't need to graduate into more debt and more poverty,\nbut rather have something that pushes all the fears of post-graduation back[7].\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Inkscape+tutorial\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TdvUcVZFWs\n[4]:

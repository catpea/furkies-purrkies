  <p>There is a strange animal that kind of speaks,<br>and it is in charge of Winter ... usually wanting six more weeks.</p>
  <p>It's thoughts do not usually run very deep,<br>he merely wants winter so that he can sleep.</p>

  <p>Truth be told,<br>he looks as tired, as old.</p>
  <p>And he is as old,<br>as we are terrified of the cold.</p>

  <p>While some say that he eats babies,<br>and has long ago gone crazy from rabies.</p>
  <p>He's been messing with the weather since, 1886,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxRwbYYuZMk">he has friends in politics</a>.</p>

  <p>Nobody knows anything about him,<br>and we only know him by his pseudonym.</p>
  <p>Some love him, some hate him,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZdIYAHtYNE">others try to re-create him</a>.</p>

  <p>But he is as judicious,<br>as mysterious and suspicious.</p>
  <p>We should try to lean more about him,<br>though our chances are slim.</p>

  <p>Until then, I hope you don't mind,<br>for he will rule over Human Kind.</p>
  <p>Simply put, if we wants to sleep more,<br>there will be snow galore.</p>

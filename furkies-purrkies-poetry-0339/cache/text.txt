It is hard not to love when Composers mix ancient and modern instruments,
in this tutorial I will also throw in a hint of beat-boxing to the mix.

The first unusual sound that caught my attention was the steel drums in Commando,
every time I hear them, they stick out like crazy.

You can hear it really well in:
Drive Away From Pier.

Jammes Horner the Composer and Conductor was apparently creating a tie in with the island battle at the end of the movie,
but since I was just paying attention to the guns and action it seemed really odd to me.

I think Jammes Horner just loves Steel Drums,
and I completely understand him, because I love them too, especially in an orchestral setting.

Most recently however, it the soundtrack to Wonder Woman,
that really impressed me with the drum work, it is just really serious, clean, orchestral and just beautiful to me.

The addition of the guitar is really nice too,
the mixing of the ancient war drum and the modern electric guitar is just perfect.

Most notably it was a song named The Dream, from Total Recall by Jerry Goldsmith
that awakened something in me, I listened to it countless times, even recently.

It is of some note that Hans Zimmer's use of that horn,
is something that I feel is related to all this, as that horn fits really well in songs that mix modern and ancient.

I also want to add an honorable mention here Jerry Goldsmith's Main Title to Rambo First Blood Part II,
is so beautiful that it has a life on its own far beyond any of those movies.

Let us not delay any longer and compose something new and old,
I didn't just want to re-create sounds from my past for this song.

So I am going to show you how our voice can become an instrument too,
I made a quick list of interesting sounds we can make and made a recording of it.

Here is what that sounds like:
Boom, Bounce, Cha, Cyk, Da, Dum, Kisss, Ks, Ksh, Ksz, Pff, Pow, T, TC, Tch, Th, Ts, Tsh, Tss, TT

* Beat Box Mix Plays *

I didn't use all of them in the song,
I used just enough to give a little tribal flavor to the whole piece.

Without further adu, let us combine some of these ideas together into a song:

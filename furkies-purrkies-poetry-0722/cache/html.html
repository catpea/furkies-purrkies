  <p>It is one of the best things that can happen to you,<br>because then you are stuck with your beautiful art portfolio.</p>
  <p>Even if you deleted your art portfolio,<br>you can't wash away the fact, that you are an artist, now.</p>
  <p>You have your portfolio,<br>and a dream of a business.</p>
  <p>But before you is a gap,<br>and it requires that you build a bridge.</p>
  <p>That is called, a beginning,<br>that is how every business entrepreneur starts.</p>
  <p>The gap and the bridge,<br>is a blessing.</p>
  <p>Here you are not doing business for business sake,<br>here you have a reason.</p>
  <p>You become driven,<br>you learn without trying, and you advance without pushing.</p>

  <p>Once you realize that kind of paying the bills is not enough,<br>it will take but a moment of rest, to invent the next step.</p>
  <p>The next step that builds on top of your beautiful art portfolio,<br>that indestructible nucleus that is all the proof you can do it.</p>

  <p>Your beautiful, nine piece art portfolio,<br>born of hope, realism, inspiration, comprehension, understanding, rage, and rebellion.</p>
  <p>Ignited by the deceptively simple process of placing a transparent reference image,<br>over your entire canvas to allow you to pick the correct colors.</p>
  <p>Is a a magical ticket,<br>out of the world of darkness.</p>
  <p>Print out the pieces of nine,<br>hold it in your hand.</p>
  <p>Look at all the details you put there,<br>all the pixels that you put there.</p>
  <p>And notice, how that dark fantasy of sick men,<br>of creatures that sold the word.</p>
  <p>Trembles before you,<br>how the sickens of the broken men has no power over you.</p>
  <p>Your pieces of nine,<br>truly, fully, deeply, are a magical ticket that helps you rise.</p>

  <p>You take out your journal,<br>that has the sticker version of your pieces of nine plastered all over.</p>
  <p>And you start building the bridge,<br>you work on the systems diagrams.</p>
  <p>It is a very simple program,<br>a person comes to the website, uploads an image, for about $50 dollars.</p>
  <p>The image goes into a task queue,<br>someone scores it for quality, talk to the customer about improvements.</p>
  <p>Then the artists that signed up with your company,<br>begin their work.</p>
  <p>Three artists that like the photo, create a total of nine images,<br>and the customer orders two of them to completion, $50 each.</p>
  <p>For a total of $150 dollars the customer gets two unique portraits,<br>you take %25 percent of that.</p>
  <p>And the artists, don't just make the money,<br>they add another piece to their portfolio.</p>

  <p>During sign-up, you train your artists to use Krita,<br>and stretch the reference image using Reference Images Tool over the entire canvas.</p>
  <p>Where it becomes both perfect color,<br>and perfect shape reference.</p>
  <p>And let your artists form guilds that adhere to a particular technique,<br>and let them create their own storefronts under the umbrella of your system, it all works out great in the end.</p>
  <p>Whenever an artist brings users to their own store,<br>it generates new traffic to the whole website, which is good for all artists.</p>
  <p>And you should allow thousands,<br>or tens of thousands artists to sign up.</p>
  <p>And though you can try to have a "there will be no slightly crooked paintings sold by your business" guarantee,<br>people will come in and trance from reference, and that is good too.</p>
  <p>A good part of art,<br>is meditation.</p>

  <p>Do you see, if your initial business worked out,<br>all you would be able to do is pay the bills, and get some gadgets.</p>
  <p>But because there was a gap,<br>your heart was challenged to innovate.</p>
  <p>To grow from Artist to Entrepreneur,<br>from few hundred dollars, to just about 10 million per month.</p>
  <p>Grow in creativity, passion, hope, imagination, adventure cheerfulness,<br>and a gentle and beautiful vision.</p>
  <p>A vision that surely,<br>can remind all how amazing it is to have portraits of people they love - painted just for them in the colors they love - hanging all around their house.</p>
  <p>And of course, it is not all love, all the time,<br>hopefully you will have a Lowbrow Art option for that uncle that talks politics all the time, where people can choose from the following options.</p>
  <p>one eye bigger than the other,<br>pant-less in grandmother pantaloons,<br>tiny little mouth,<br>extra wrinkles,<br>eye patch,<br>googly eyes,<br>strange hat,<br>handcuffs,<br>missing tooth...</p>
  <p>And finally, prevent the artist from tracing the likeness even with some extra loose technique,<br>and make the final outcome slightly crooked, so that everyone has to equally slightly pretend is it good.</p>
  <p>"Nah, its good, its really good,<br>it looks like him... you are very talented - you were always very talented as a child"</p>
  <p>Actually you spoke before your father did,<br>after he found out about my pregnancy.</p>
  <p>Tremendous,<br>talent...</p>

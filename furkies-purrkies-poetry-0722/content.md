It is one of the best things that can happen to you,
because then you are stuck with your beautiful art portfolio.

Even if you deleted your art portfolio,
you can't wash away the fact, that you are an artist, now.

You have your portfolio,
and a dream of a business.

But before you is a gap,
and it requires that you build a bridge.

That is called, a beginning,
that is how every business entrepreneur starts.

The gap and the bridge,
is a blessing.

Here you are not doing business for business sake,
here you have a reason.

You become driven,
you learn without trying, and you advance without pushing.

Once you realize that kind of paying the bills is not enough,
it will take but a moment of rest, to invent the next step.

The next step that builds on top of your beautiful art portfolio,
that indestructible nucleus that is all the proof you can do it.

Your beautiful, nine piece art portfolio,
born of hope, realism, inspiration, comprehension, understanding, rage, and rebellion.

Ignited by the deceptively simple process of placing a transparent reference image,
over your entire canvas to allow you to pick the correct colors.

Is a a magical ticket,
out of the world of darkness.

Print out the pieces of nine,
hold it in your hand.

Look at all the details you put there,
all the pixels that you put there.

And notice, how that dark fantasy of sick men,
of creatures that sold the word.

Trembles before you,
how the sickens of the broken men has no power over you.

Your pieces of nine,
truly, fully, deeply, are a magical ticket that helps you rise.

You take out your journal,
that has the sticker version of your pieces of nine plastered all over.

And you start building the bridge,
you work on the systems diagrams.

It is a very simple program,
a person comes to the website, uploads an image, for about $50 dollars.

The image goes into a task queue,
someone scores it for quality, talk to the customer about improvements.

Then the artists that signed up with your company,
begin their work.

Three artists that like the photo, create a total of nine images,
and the customer orders two of them to completion, $50 each.

For a total of $150 dollars the customer gets two unique portraits,
you take %25 percent of that.

And the artists, don't just make the money,
they add another piece to their portfolio.

---

During sign-up, you train your artists to use Krita,
and stretch the reference image using Reference Images Tool over the entire canvas.

Where it becomes both perfect color,
and perfect shape reference.

And let your artists form guilds that adhere to a particular technique,
and let them create their own storefronts under the umbrella of your system, it all works out great in the end.

Whenever an artist brings users to their own store,
it generates new traffic to the whole website, which is good for all artists.

And you should allow thousands,
or tens of thousands artists to sign up.

And though you can try to have a "there will be no slightly crooked paintings sold by your business" guarantee,
people will come in and trance from reference, and that is good too.

A good part of art,
is meditation.

Do you see, if your initial business worked out,
all you would be able to do is pay the bills, and get some gadgets.

But because there was a gap,
your heart was challenged to innovate.

To grow from Artist to Entrepreneur,
from few hundred dollars, to just about 10 million per month.

Grow in creativity, passion, hope, imagination, adventure cheerfulness,
and a gentle and beautiful vision.

A vision that surely,
can remind all how amazing it is to have portraits of people they love - painted just for them in the colors they love - hanging all around their house.

And of course, it is not all love, all the time,
hopefully you will have a Lowbrow Art option for that uncle that talks politics all the time, where people can choose from the following options.

one eye bigger than the other,
pant-less in grandmother pantaloons,
tiny little mouth,
extra wrinkles,
eye patch,
googly eyes,
strange hat,
handcuffs,
missing tooth...

And finally, prevent the artist from tracing the likeness even with some extra loose technique,
and make the final outcome slightly crooked, so that everyone has to equally slightly pretend is it good.

"Nah, its good, its really good,
it looks like him... you are very talented - you were always very talented as a child"

Actually you spoke before your father did,
after he found out about my pregnancy.

Tremendous,
talent...

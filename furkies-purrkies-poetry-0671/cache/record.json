  "text": "This strange poem is not really about fixing old plumbing,\nit is about the power of design.\nI don't particularly need a lion head tub handle,\nbut I am speechless about what a wonderful way to further my 3D modeling skills this is.\nWhen there is nothing to do on holidays,\nbut wait for the stores to reopen, I take to creating cool things.\nOriginally I would write little programs,\nbut now I also compose, and as the case is today refuse to properly fix my shower.\n\nWith a horrendous roar,\nmy shower announced it needs new washers.\nThe repairs only take a short moment,\nbut it took a long time to understand what is going on.\n\nIn short the Tub Spout is destined at a wrong angle,\nsmall drops of water will run along the tub spout and into the wall.\nThe water leaks because,\nthe washers get used up.\nAnd the washers get used up,\nbecause the pipe that washers press against has corded and became sharp.\nThe corroded assembly maybe 40 years old,\nI may need to to use my dremmel to take off the edge.\n\nI think of this as fun detective work,\nI would never guess that the minor leaks can run along the tub spout into the wall.\nInstead of just dripping down,\nlike it should - where is gravity when you need it.\n\nAnd then of course the newly broken knob,\nsqueaked at me again as if to inquire on the status of her redesign.\nThe water stem that stick out of the wall,\nhas these little grippy teeth that have worn out as it is a soft metal.\nThis calls for a replacement which probably costs $10,\nbut not before I try to print out my own idea of how it should all work.\n\nThis looks like a job that will include the use of epoxy glue,\nI've designed a stem sleeve with its own teeth that are meant to get in between the worn out ones.\nWith hopefully quick drying hard epoxy glue,\nit shouldn't be a problem at all.\nThe reason I designed the stem sleeve separately from the shower/tub handles,\nis because I want to try out different designs.\nThis is also why I made the water stem that sticks out of the wall and holds the handles,\nsquare.\nMy design does not need a screw it just snaps on,\nthere is a square hole in the back of the handles I designed.\nThe square sleeve can accept simple designs,\nbut also things like lion heads, anything.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that there are overhangs in these parts,\none example is the inset screw at the end of the stem sleeve.\nThat means I need to use supports,\nthis is an automatic feature of slicing software.\nIt just fills in where the printer would be forced to print on air,\nand the fill is like a simple mesh that is easy to snap off.\nThe supported surface will fee rough after removal of the support material,\nthat can mean sanding it down, or in my case leaving it be as the inset is covered by the screw head.\n\n3D Modeling for 3D printing has to take air gaps under consideration,\nthis can be challenging in complex designs.\nThe machine-gun like wallet I recently made[1],\nactually started off on paper, and completely eliminates the need for supports.\nIt is is my first large print out and it does suffer from warping,\nthough it is just the outside part of the wallet.\nWarping is another thing to consider during 3D modeling,\nto put it simply plastic shrinks a tiny bit as it dries.\nSometimes this may cause lifting of the part being printed,\nwhich demands setting the print surface hotter and a brim.\nBrims, like the brim on a hat,\naim to prevent a part from lifting.\n\nAll these issues, require practice,\nand to make practice fun, fixing things around the house is the way to go.\nWhich is why I made my shower,\nthe subject of today's poem.\n\nThe lions head handle,\nis actually the beginning of my New Year's resolution.\nWith what I have learned thus far,\nI am able to add Designing Jewelry as a hobby.\nI print in plastic because it is inexpensive and great for prototyping,\nbut there are companies that print in wax to make molds, and pour molten metals inside[2].\nWhile it is too scary for me,\nsome people are fine with lost wax casting at home[3].\nI think it is somewhat of a tradition to make a Lion's Head ring,\nand that will be my first project of this New Years resolution: Begin Designing Jewelry.\nIt does not actually cost me anything up front,\nthe rings will only be poured after a purchase is made.\nThey won't be too expensive to the customer either,\nI will sell in Bronze, Gold and Silver.\n\nIn closing, I want to present this little story,\nas an example of self education.\nThere is not time in school to learn for real,\nit may not be possible to get a solid education out of a standardized curriculum.\nWe are thinking beings,\nwe must learn, and we must learn for real.\nReal skills,\nthat enable us to create real things.\nWe need context for learning,\nbe it a shower handle or a precious jewelry piece we need a reason to learn and remember.\nWe must not allow ourselves to be tricked into a fake education,\nthat only wastes our time.\nSelf Education above all,\nand from Knowledge comes Wisdom, and from Wisdom Greatness.\nHappy New Year.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cqjoiNqLrbg\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJuTM0Y7U1k\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBAkI78--cE",

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the washers get used up,<br>because the pipe that washers press against has corded and became sharp.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The water stem that stick out of the wall,<br>has these little grippy teeth that have worn out as it is a soft metal.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This looks like a job that will include the use of epoxy glue,<br>I've designed a stem sleeve with its own teeth that are meant to get in between the worn out ones.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">With hopefully quick drying hard epoxy glue,<br>it shouldn't be a problem at all.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The reason I designed the stem sleeve separately from the shower/tub handles,<br>is because I want to try out different designs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is also why I made the water stem that sticks out of the wall and holds the handles,<br>square.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My design does not need a screw it just snaps on,<br>there is a square hole in the back of the handles I designed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The square sleeve can accept simple designs,<br>but also things like lion heads, anything.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is worth mentioning that there are overhangs in these parts,<br>one example is the inset screw at the end of the stem sleeve.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That means I need to use supports,<br>this is an automatic feature of slicing software.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It just fills in where the printer would be forced to print on air,<br>and the fill is like a simple mesh that is easy to snap off.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The supported surface will fee rough after removal of the support material,<br>that can mean sanding it down, or in my case leaving it be as the inset is covered by the screw head.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">3D Modeling for 3D printing has to take air gaps under consideration,<br>this can be challenging in complex designs.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is is my first large print out and it does suffer from warping,<br>though it is just the outside part of the wallet.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Warping is another thing to consider during 3D modeling,<br>to put it simply plastic shrinks a tiny bit as it dries.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Sometimes this may cause lifting of the part being printed,<br>which demands setting the print surface hotter and a brim.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Brims, like the brim on a hat,<br>aim to prevent a part from lifting.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I print in plastic because it is inexpensive and great for prototyping,<br>but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJuTM0Y7U1k">there are companies that print in wax to make molds, and pour molten metals inside</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">While it is too scary for me,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBAkI78--cE">some people are fine with lost wax casting at home</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think it is somewhat of a tradition to make a Lion's Head ring,<br>and that will be my first project of this New Years resolution: Begin Designing Jewelry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It does not actually cost me anything up front,<br>the rings will only be poured after a purchase is made.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They won't be too expensive to the customer either,<br>I will sell in Bronze, Gold and Silver.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Real skills,<br>that enable us to create real things.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We need context for learning,<br>be it a shower handle or a precious jewelry piece we need a reason to learn and remember.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We must not allow ourselves to be tricked into a fake education,<br>that only wastes our time.</div>

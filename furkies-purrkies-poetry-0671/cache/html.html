  <p>This strange poem is not really about fixing old plumbing,<br>it is about the power of design.</p>
  <p>I don't particularly need a lion head tub handle,<br>but I am speechless about what a wonderful way to further my 3D modeling skills this is.</p>
  <p>When there is nothing to do on holidays,<br>but wait for the stores to reopen, I take to creating cool things.</p>
  <p>Originally I would write little programs,<br>but now I also compose, and as the case is today refuse to properly fix my shower.</p>

  <p>With a horrendous roar,<br>my shower announced it needs new washers.</p>
  <p>The repairs only take a short moment,<br>but it took a long time to understand what is going on.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>In short the Tub Spout is destined at a wrong angle,<br>small drops of water will run along the tub spout and into the wall.</p>
  <p>The water leaks because,<br>the washers get used up.</p>
  <p>And the washers get used up,<br>because the pipe that washers press against has corded and became sharp.</p>
  <p>The corroded assembly maybe 40 years old,<br>I may need to to use my dremmel to take off the edge.</p>

  <p>I think of this as fun detective work,<br>I would never guess that the minor leaks can run along the tub spout into the wall.</p>
  <p>Instead of just dripping down,<br>like it should - where is gravity when you need it.</p>

  <p>And then of course the newly broken knob,<br>squeaked at me again as if to inquire on the status of her redesign.</p>
  <p>The water stem that stick out of the wall,<br>has these little grippy teeth that have worn out as it is a soft metal.</p>
  <p>This calls for a replacement which probably costs $10,<br>but not before I try to print out my own idea of how it should all work.</p>

  <p>This looks like a job that will include the use of epoxy glue,<br>I've designed a stem sleeve with its own teeth that are meant to get in between the worn out ones.</p>
  <p>With hopefully quick drying hard epoxy glue,<br>it shouldn't be a problem at all.</p>
  <p>The reason I designed the stem sleeve separately from the shower/tub handles,<br>is because I want to try out different designs.</p>
  <p>This is also why I made the water stem that sticks out of the wall and holds the handles,<br>square.</p>
  <p>My design does not need a screw it just snaps on,<br>there is a square hole in the back of the handles I designed.</p>
  <p>The square sleeve can accept simple designs,<br>but also things like lion heads, anything.</p>

  <p>It is worth mentioning that there are overhangs in these parts,<br>one example is the inset screw at the end of the stem sleeve.</p>
  <p>That means I need to use supports,<br>this is an automatic feature of slicing software.</p>
  <p>It just fills in where the printer would be forced to print on air,<br>and the fill is like a simple mesh that is easy to snap off.</p>
  <p>The supported surface will fee rough after removal of the support material,<br>that can mean sanding it down, or in my case leaving it be as the inset is covered by the screw head.</p>

  <p>3D Modeling for 3D printing has to take air gaps under consideration,<br>this can be challenging in complex designs.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cqjoiNqLrbg">machine-gun like wallet I recently made</a>,<br>actually started off on paper, and completely eliminates the need for supports.</p>
  <p>It is is my first large print out and it does suffer from warping,<br>though it is just the outside part of the wallet.</p>
  <p>Warping is another thing to consider during 3D modeling,<br>to put it simply plastic shrinks a tiny bit as it dries.</p>
  <p>Sometimes this may cause lifting of the part being printed,<br>which demands setting the print surface hotter and a brim.</p>
  <p>Brims, like the brim on a hat,<br>aim to prevent a part from lifting.</p>

  <p>All these issues, require practice,<br>and to make practice fun, fixing things around the house is the way to go.</p>

  <p>The lions head handle,<br>is actually the beginning of my New Year's resolution.</p>
  <p>With what I have learned thus far,<br>I am able to add Designing Jewelry as a hobby.</p>
  <p>I print in plastic because it is inexpensive and great for prototyping,<br>but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJuTM0Y7U1k">there are companies that print in wax to make molds, and pour molten metals inside</a>.</p>
  <p>While it is too scary for me,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBAkI78--cE">some people are fine with lost wax casting at home</a>.</p>
  <p>I think it is somewhat of a tradition to make a Lion's Head ring,<br>and that will be my first project of this New Years resolution: Begin Designing Jewelry.</p>
  <p>It does not actually cost me anything up front,<br>the rings will only be poured after a purchase is made.</p>
  <p>They won't be too expensive to the customer either,<br>I will sell in Bronze, Gold and Silver.</p>

  <p>In closing, I want to present this little story,<br>as an example of self education.</p>
  <p>There is not time in school to learn for real,<br>it may not be possible to get a solid education out of a standardized curriculum.</p>
  <p>We are thinking beings,<br>we must learn, and we must learn for real.</p>
  <p>Real skills,<br>that enable us to create real things.</p>
  <p>We need context for learning,<br>be it a shower handle or a precious jewelry piece we need a reason to learn and remember.</p>
  <p>We must not allow ourselves to be tricked into a fake education,<br>that only wastes our time.</p>
  <p>Self Education above all,<br>and from Knowledge comes Wisdom, and from Wisdom Greatness.</p>
  <p>Happy New Year.</p>

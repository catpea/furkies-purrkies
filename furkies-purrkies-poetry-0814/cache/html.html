  <p>Let me tell you something about my superhero belt,<br>you know the little hinge that makes the belt compartments open.</p>
  <p>Yeah, I can tell my computer program,<br>how many hinging units my hinge has.</p>
  <p>Just in case some of my superhero belt compartments,<br>need increased durability.</p>
  <p>Not only that, but my belt compartment hinges,<br>automatically configure themselves to my belt compartments.</p>
  <p>All I need to do is select a cube for future fabrication,<br>and my program will insert a hole, and make a proper hinge to match.</p>
  <p>I donâ€™t specify any dimensions,<br>my advanced superhero belt design program...</p>
  <p>Automatically calculates all the dimensions,<br>based on the initial cube it self.</p>

  <p>It is worth mentioning,<br>that creating a belt for a sidekick is easy if not downright trivial.</p>
  <p>Be it a wise alley cat or a silly neighborhood pug,<br>the belt can be automatically scaled down to a collar size.</p>
  <p>It truly makes crime fighting,<br>just a breeze.</p>

  <p>The belt potential lies far beyond,<br>mere crime fighting, though.</p>
  <p>For one it is possible to create a belt configuration,<br>that is easily attacked to car seats or bicycle handlebars.</p>
  <p>Ready to safely store anything from important parts,<br>to delicious snacks.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>But even beyond that the belt can be configured,<br>on a much smaller scale to create unforgettable jewelry.</p>
  <p>For one a useful belt for a foot,<br>can go a loooong way.</p>
  <p>But even on smaller scale, things make sense too,<br>a utility belt bracelet can for example store vitamins or a coin or two.</p>
  <p>And even beyond that,<br>a utility belt necklace, or earrings...</p>
  <p>Can be built so secure precious stones or diamonds,<br>or even a small smoke bomb.</p>
  <p>And a superhero ring can be made to hold,<br>even smaller things such as a little memory card with music.</p>

  <p>I do not want to close on a foolish note,<br>so I will add that the beta testing will be done in miniature form.</p>
  <p>I will create a series of compartments, to fit the band of my wrist watch,<br>where I plan to keep some extra workout music on sd-cards.</p>

  <p>The most colorful use,<br>is for Halloween costumes of course.</p>
  <p>But perhaps the next version of the belt,<br>can be more like a kit or plastic blocks we remember from childhood.</p>
  <p>I think letting the computer design variations of different compartments,<br>to make the assembly kits more interesting will be very rewarding.</p>
  <p>Such a kit could easily create compartments,<br>for wallets, keys, and different sized phones.</p>

  <p>And in the future, perhaps something classy,<br>that does not stand out for a change.</p>
  <p>A compartment for cash, a compartment for cards, a compartment for a car remote,<br>and separate rooms for keys, and change.</p>
  <p>And of course easy to access smoke bomb,<br>to easily escape weird situations.</p>

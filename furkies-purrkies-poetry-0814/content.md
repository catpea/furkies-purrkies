Let me tell you something about my superhero belt,
you know the little hinge that makes the belt compartments open.

Yeah, I can tell my computer program,
how many hinging units my hinge has.

Just in case some of my superhero belt compartments,
need increased durability.

Not only that, but my belt compartment hinges,
automatically configure themselves to my belt compartments.

All I need to do is select a cube for future fabrication,
and my program will insert a hole, and make a proper hinge to match.

I donâ€™t specify any dimensions,
my advanced superhero belt design program...

Automatically calculates all the dimensions,
based on the initial cube it self.

It is worth mentioning,
that creating a belt for a sidekick is easy if not downright trivial.

Be it a wise alley cat or a silly neighborhood pug,
the belt can be automatically scaled down to a collar size.

It truly makes crime fighting,
just a breeze.

---

The belt potential lies far beyond,
mere crime fighting, though.

For one it is possible to create a belt configuration,
that is easily attacked to car seats or bicycle handlebars.

Ready to safely store anything from important parts,
to delicious snacks.

---

But even beyond that the belt can be configured,
on a much smaller scale to create unforgettable jewelry.

For one a useful belt for a foot,
can go a loooong way.

But even on smaller scale, things make sense too,
a utility belt bracelet can for example store vitamins or a coin or two.

And even beyond that,
a utility belt necklace, or earrings...

Can be built so secure precious stones or diamonds,
or even a small smoke bomb.

And a superhero ring can be made to hold,
even smaller things such as a little memory card with music.

---

I do not want to close on a foolish note,
so I will add that the beta testing will be done in miniature form.

I will create a series of compartments, to fit the band of my wrist watch,
where I plan to keep some extra workout music on sd-cards.

---

The most colorful use,
is for Halloween costumes of course.

But perhaps the next version of the belt,
can be more like a kit or plastic blocks we remember from childhood.

I think letting the computer design variations of different compartments,
to make the assembly kits more interesting will be very rewarding.

Such a kit could easily create compartments,
for wallets, keys, and different sized phones.

---

And in the future, perhaps something classy,
that does not stand out for a change.

A compartment for cash, a compartment for cards, a compartment for a car remote,
and separate rooms for keys, and change.

And of course easy to access smoke bomb,
to easily escape weird situations.

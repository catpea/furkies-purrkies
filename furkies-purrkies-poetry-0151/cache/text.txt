It has been a quarter of a century, but I still remember the sounds of New York,
I can almost hear the busy parks, and cars and the occasional police siren.
I still remember that a slice of New York Pizza across the street,
is one dollar and twenty five cents, I am sure no pizza takes that! amazing anymore.

And, wow, to this day I cannot get over the fact,
that five cents is bigger than ten.
With each passing year I bemoan the injustice,
of December not being the tenth month, and October not being the eight.

While I never had a problem with fractions and the sixteenth of an inch,
glancing 9/16 or 7/8 on a piece of paper, makes me want to begin with a calculator in hand.
I never figured out how to spell the word "W", I know it is written as a letter, but how do you spell it,
and I love that the letter "W" may actually mean Double-U; fantastic.

My biggest problem is with Weather,
as I never really switched to the Fahrenheit scale.
It just shows that you can take a mam out of the metric system,
but you can't take the metric system out of a man.

My reptile brain just accepted somehow that every few months it gets boiling hot outside,
during hot summers, I catch my self staring at my thermometer that extra second longer,
and slowly I go... What the ffffffff.. it is a hundred and five,
shut the FFront door.

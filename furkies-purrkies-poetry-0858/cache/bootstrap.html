    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As you probably have figured out all the subject divisions are wrong,<br>they exist for the school not for the student.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And we need a real-world,<br>source of subjects.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Both to adopt it,<br>and expand the list by subtle analogy to existing items.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs">YCombinator Request For Startups</a>,<br>is an a-OK start.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It contains items such as Education, Software, Virtual and Augmented Reality,<br>and Artificial Intelligence, Healthcare and Government 2.0.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I would add, Nature & Adventure, Art , Design, Music, and Music Composition,<br>Web and Application Programming, 3D Modeling and Printing, Open Source Operating Systems, and a few others.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is easy to think of these as majors, but student minds don’t work like that,<br>these are just doors to step through and revisit.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The structure of the school is just a tree,<br>students are presented with many branches, and pick one.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">After they fill their curiosity, they are presented with all the unopened doors,<br>and allowed to revisit subjects they already explored to learn more about them.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The ultimate measuring stick to define a proper class,<br>is sad, and unfortunate, as it relates to the development level of our civilization.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And in case you didn’t know, schools are fake, money is misused to choke the world,<br>and some severely stupid people think war is just good entertainment to be had from time to time.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Make no mistake, dictators do not just wage war to hide their economic failure,<br>they do it because it entertains them and tightens the bonds with all the equally stupid yes-men.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is no question that schools need instant repair,<br>but that repair must also be on point, or relative to where humanity stand.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So in sadness, I declare that subjects are to - ultimately - to be divided,<br>in a way that helps the student exit poverty.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And those who head for politics will have to adapt the world,<br>to Universal Income, $100 US dollars per day in 2020 money, reset to 100 every midnight.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You will not believe what the students heading for politics,<br>will teach you about inflation as they come closer and closer to unchaining the world.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To be clear, students will no longer be taught mathematics,<br>because that never worked.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Instead, they will learn mathematics, by wanting to learn mathematics,<br>to increase the chances of their little companies making more money.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A computer artist hoping to sell their enormous and enormously complex Generative Art,<br>will want to learn math, and it will take them weeks of self education, and not years of no education.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What is important to notice here, that math is alive and well, thriving more than ever,<br>but it is not presented in the context of something that is useful to the students.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">More than that, some of the new subject divisions are quite startling,<br>for example Jewelry creation or generation by means of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLA8VPRRi6A">JSCAD</a> and 3D printing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once the initial list of subjects is expanded,<br>everyone will find something fascinating.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Students will spend countless minutes looking for new topics,<br>for new ways to use their existing knowledge.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And above all for new things to learn,<br>that will allow them to progress to the subjects that are few steps removed, but now closer than ever.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">From the students perspective, the most important perspective,<br>a subject is defined as something that they feel passionate about.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That is delivered to them in a way that feels like Poetry,<br>it is presented in the best way possible.</div>

  <p>As you probably have figured out all the subject divisions are wrong,<br>they exist for the school not for the student.</p>
  <p>And we need a real-world,<br>source of subjects.</p>
  <p>Both to adopt it,<br>and expand the list by subtle analogy to existing items.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs">YCombinator Request For Startups</a>,<br>is an a-OK start.</p>
  <p>It contains items such as Education, Software, Virtual and Augmented Reality,<br>and Artificial Intelligence, Healthcare and Government 2.0.</p>
  <p>And I would add, Nature & Adventure, Art , Design, Music, and Music Composition,<br>Web and Application Programming, 3D Modeling and Printing, Open Source Operating Systems, and a few others.</p>
  <p>It is easy to think of these as majors, but student minds don’t work like that,<br>these are just doors to step through and revisit.</p>
  <p>The structure of the school is just a tree,<br>students are presented with many branches, and pick one.</p>
  <p>After they fill their curiosity, they are presented with all the unopened doors,<br>and allowed to revisit subjects they already explored to learn more about them.</p>

  <p>The ultimate measuring stick to define a proper class,<br>is sad, and unfortunate, as it relates to the development level of our civilization.</p>
  <p>And in case you didn’t know, schools are fake, money is misused to choke the world,<br>and some severely stupid people think war is just good entertainment to be had from time to time.</p>
  <p>Make no mistake, dictators do not just wage war to hide their economic failure,<br>they do it because it entertains them and tightens the bonds with all the equally stupid yes-men.</p>
  <p>There is no question that schools need instant repair,<br>but that repair must also be on point, or relative to where humanity stand.</p>
  <p>So in sadness, I declare that subjects are to - ultimately - to be divided,<br>in a way that helps the student exit poverty.</p>
  <p>And those who head for politics will have to adapt the world,<br>to Universal Income, $100 US dollars per day in 2020 money, reset to 100 every midnight.</p>
  <p>You will not believe what the students heading for politics,<br>will teach you about inflation as they come closer and closer to unchaining the world.</p>

  <p>To be clear, students will no longer be taught mathematics,<br>because that never worked.</p>
  <p>Instead, they will learn mathematics, by wanting to learn mathematics,<br>to increase the chances of their little companies making more money.</p>
  <p>A computer artist hoping to sell their enormous and enormously complex Generative Art,<br>will want to learn math, and it will take them weeks of self education, and not years of no education.</p>
  <p>What is important to notice here, that math is alive and well, thriving more than ever,<br>but it is not presented in the context of something that is useful to the students.</p>
  <p>More than that, some of the new subject divisions are quite startling,<br>for example Jewelry creation or generation by means of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLA8VPRRi6A">JSCAD</a> and 3D printing.</p>
  <p>Once the initial list of subjects is expanded,<br>everyone will find something fascinating.</p>
  <p>Students will spend countless minutes looking for new topics,<br>for new ways to use their existing knowledge.</p>
  <p>And above all for new things to learn,<br>that will allow them to progress to the subjects that are few steps removed, but now closer than ever.</p>

  <p>The definition of a worthy subject, is a smallest possible cluster of topics,<br>that come together to help the student out of poverty.</p>
  <p>To help them pay for an apartment, for food,<br>for travel and new inventions.</p>
  <p>From the students perspective, the most important perspective,<br>a subject is defined as something that they feel passionate about.</p>
  <p>That is delivered to them in a way that feels like Poetry,<br>it is presented in the best way possible.</p>

  <p>Finally, there are no grades, there is no graduation, the doors are always open for more,<br>there is no punishment, no getting kicked out.</p>
  <p>It is understood that the misguided, are just that, victims of warped cultures and lack of knowledge,<br>this school will repair that.</p>
  <p>This school is like the universal income that the students will eventually turn to reality,<br>it cannot be take away from anybody - not from a horrible criminal, not from a being who may afford something better - it may not be taken away for any reason.</p>
  <p>The real school, and the real education it brings to the world,<br>it is a gift that will never be taken back.</p>

Subject divisions in schools are perfectly broken,
they reflect nothing about education.

A room labeled Calculus,
that imbues students with calculus, is a stupid fantasy.

It comes into being on the wings of people that either,
pretend to have an education, or don't realize that they are uneducated.

---

It starts with politics, mayors, principals,
and teachers that are aware of the word programming.

It lines the pockets of both textbook manufacturers,
and those that produce materials for teachers.

The company behind the programming language,
will lie, cheat, and steal, to later charge the graduates for using the language.

The company associated with the computers or operating system,
will make a bunch, to say the least.

Over the course of few semesters,
the teachers memorize what to say, what to do, how to tweak tests, etc.

Then you enter the classroom,
and become forced into tricking yourself into thinking you found a shortcut.

Teachers that can't teach, will make the material more abstract,
to force you into memorization, and you forget programming with your last test.

---

The program you are making at the end of the semester,
if it is something you can't sell, then the class is fake.

Here, many teachers would check me,
and say, but you can't possibly accomplish that in a single semester.

You probably can, but, yes,
the semesters are too short.

The class cannot end until everyone serious about programming,
is selling multiple copies of their program.

---

School is one of several broken ways of learning,
school want you to memorize and get a job.

Schools can't educate you,
as education id a deeply Beautiful and Personal thing.

Your education is exactly as unique as you,
and there is a __system__ of self education.

---

I am very sorry that this is somewhat costly,
even if you never get it all working, you will still know that you could.

And you only buy it after you learn the software,
by which time it won't be an expense but a necessity, like a functional heater.

---

What I am showing you here is a group of related things,
that mutually reinforce one another, and burst with knowledge.

Eventually you may need to consider purchasing [Creality Ender 3 V2 3D Printer][2] priced at [$300][3] dollars,
and the [Creality Ender CR Touch Auto Bed Leveling Sensor Kit][4] priced at [$40 dollars][5].

You only pay for the hardware, the software is free, the reason why the hardware is so important here,
is that you will be able to create real things straight from your imagination.

To design your objects, [you will need to take the Doughnut Tutorial][6],
[followed by the Precision Modeling in Blender series][7].

And finally, [familiarize yourself, with using the Prusa Slicer with your Ender printer][8],
and [visit Thingverse to get an idea what people are printing][9].

---

In conclusion, I want you to notice the difference between what I presented here,
and what schools and maybe [others are trying to convince you of][1].

When you finish the tutorials, in the peace and privacy of your home,
you will be able to print out anything you can imagine.

When you participate in fake education,
you get nothing back.

I think it is a function of fake education to rob you of your genius,
to trick you into thinking that you didn't get anything out of fake education, because you are not good enough.

The real reason why you are not getting anything out of those things,
is because fraudulent systems aren't able to produce anything.

---

Even if you don't by the printer,
and only peek at the tutorials, you can still use this as a magnificent measuring stick, and a guide to model you next lesson in self education.

Next time you pay for something or take a class,
ask yourself if you will get something real in return.

[And you have to expect real results from a class][10],
because having memorized some formulas or created a useless program, will do nothing for you because of the speed with which life moves.

Real education provides breathtaking results, fake education, keeps promising until the promises don't matter anymore,
as your employer ask you to forget everything you learned, and tells you what you need to know, and finally replaces you with cheaper employees.

Being tricked out of real education is a terrible curse,
I encourage you to independent self education, and relentless, life long search for wisdom and greatness.

Make sure that all your lessons are breathtaking and magical,
and grant you amazing new powers.

Do not let anybody trick you,
if it provides no results, or incoherent results, it is not real education.

You are meant to be passionate about what you have learned,
you are meant gain great wisdom, and you are meant to become a great being.

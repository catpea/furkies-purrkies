  <p>Subject divisions in schools are perfectly broken,<br>they reflect nothing about education.</p>
  <p>A room labeled Calculus,<br>that imbues students with calculus, is a stupid fantasy.</p>
  <p>It comes into being on the wings of people that either,<br>pretend to have an education, or don't realize that they are uneducated.</p>

  <p>It starts with politics, mayors, principals,<br>and teachers that are aware of the word programming.</p>
  <p>It lines the pockets of both textbook manufacturers,<br>and those that produce materials for teachers.</p>
  <p>The company behind the programming language,<br>will lie, cheat, and steal, to later charge the graduates for using the language.</p>
  <p>The company associated with the computers or operating system,<br>will make a bunch, to say the least.</p>
  <p>Over the course of few semesters,<br>the teachers memorize what to say, what to do, how to tweak tests, etc.</p>
  <p>Then you enter the classroom,<br>and become forced into tricking yourself into thinking you found a shortcut.</p>
  <p>Teachers that can't teach, will make the material more abstract,<br>to force you into memorization, and you forget programming with your last test.</p>

  <p>The program you are making at the end of the semester,<br>if it is something you can't sell, then the class is fake.</p>
  <p>Here, many teachers would check me,<br>and say, but you can't possibly accomplish that in a single semester.</p>
  <p>You probably can, but, yes,<br>the semesters are too short.</p>
  <p>The class cannot end until everyone serious about programming,<br>is selling multiple copies of their program.</p>

  <p>School is one of several broken ways of learning,<br>school want you to memorize and get a job.</p>
  <p>Schools can't educate you,<br>as education id a deeply Beautiful and Personal thing.</p>
  <p>Your education is exactly as unique as you,<br>and there is a <strong>system</strong> of self education.</p>

  <p>I am very sorry that this is somewhat costly,<br>even if you never get it all working, you will still know that you could.</p>
  <p>And you only buy it after you learn the software,<br>by which time it won't be an expense but a necessity, like a functional heater.</p>

  <p>What I am showing you here is a group of related things,<br>that mutually reinforce one another, and burst with knowledge.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I want you to notice the difference between what I presented here,<br>and what schools and maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwcuEHWO6pc">others are trying to convince you of</a>.</p>
  <p>When you finish the tutorials, in the peace and privacy of your home,<br>you will be able to print out anything you can imagine.</p>
  <p>When you participate in fake education,<br>you get nothing back.</p>
  <p>I think it is a function of fake education to rob you of your genius,<br>to trick you into thinking that you didn't get anything out of fake education, because you are not good enough.</p>
  <p>The real reason why you are not getting anything out of those things,<br>is because fraudulent systems aren't able to produce anything.</p>

  <p>Even if you don't by the printer,<br>and only peek at the tutorials, you can still use this as a magnificent measuring stick, and a guide to model you next lesson in self education.</p>
  <p>Next time you pay for something or take a class,<br>ask yourself if you will get something real in return.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Idra8rVS1I">And you have to expect real results from a class</a>,<br>because having memorized some formulas or created a useless program, will do nothing for you because of the speed with which life moves.</p>
  <p>Real education provides breathtaking results, fake education, keeps promising until the promises don't matter anymore,<br>as your employer ask you to forget everything you learned, and tells you what you need to know, and finally replaces you with cheaper employees.</p>
  <p>Being tricked out of real education is a terrible curse,<br>I encourage you to independent self education, and relentless, life long search for wisdom and greatness.</p>
  <p>Make sure that all your lessons are breathtaking and magical,<br>and grant you amazing new powers.</p>
  <p>Do not let anybody trick you,<br>if it provides no results, or incoherent results, it is not real education.</p>
  <p>You are meant to be passionate about what you have learned,<br>you are meant gain great wisdom, and you are meant to become a great being.</p>

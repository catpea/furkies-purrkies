    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When you participate in fake education,<br>you get nothing back.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think it is a function of fake education to rob you of your genius,<br>to trick you into thinking that you didn't get anything out of fake education, because you are not good enough.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The real reason why you are not getting anything out of those things,<br>is because fraudulent systems aren't able to produce anything.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Next time you pay for something or take a class,<br>ask yourself if you will get something real in return.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Idra8rVS1I">And you have to expect real results from a class</a>,<br>because having memorized some formulas or created a useless program, will do nothing for you because of the speed with which life moves.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Real education provides breathtaking results, fake education, keeps promising until the promises don't matter anymore,<br>as your employer ask you to forget everything you learned, and tells you what you need to know, and finally replaces you with cheaper employees.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Being tricked out of real education is a terrible curse,<br>I encourage you to independent self education, and relentless, life long search for wisdom and greatness.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Make sure that all your lessons are breathtaking and magical,<br>and grant you amazing new powers.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Do not let anybody trick you,<br>if it provides no results, or incoherent results, it is not real education.</div>

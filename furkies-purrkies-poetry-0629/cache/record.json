education,\nyou get nothing back.\nI think it is a function of fake education to rob you of your genius,\nto trick you into thinking that you didn't get anything out of fake education, because you are not good enough.\nThe real reason why you are not getting anything out of those things,\nis because fraudulent systems aren't able to produce anything.\n\nEven if you don't by the printer,\nand only peek at the tutorials, you can still use this as a magnificent measuring stick, and a guide to model you next lesson in self education.\nNext time you pay for something or take a class,\nask yourself if you will get something real in return.\nAnd you have to expect real results from a class[10],\nbecause having memorized some formulas or created a useless program, will do nothing for you because of the speed with which life moves.\nReal education provides breathtaking results, fake education, keeps promising until the promises don't matter anymore,\nas your employer ask you to forget everything you learned, and tells you what you need to know, and finally replaces you with cheaper employees.\nBeing tricked out of real education is a terrible curse,\nI encourage you to independent self education, and relentless, life long search for wisdom and greatness.\nMake sure that all your lessons are breathtaking and magical,\nand grant you amazing new powers.\nDo not let anybody trick you,\nif it provides no results, or incoherent results, it is not real education.\nYou are meant to be passionate about what you have learned,\nyou are meant gain great wisdom, and you are meant to become a great being.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gokN9xNG94U\n[2]: https://www.amazon.com/Creality-Mainboard-Carborundum-220x220x250mm-Beginners/dp/B08FSGXK46/\n[3]:

  <p>The word books is similar to the word humans,<br>it is a very general label.</p>
  <p>Nobody seriously says I don't like humans,<br>likewise, no one should ever say I don't like books.</p>
  <p>Those are silly things to say,<br>in fact they are meaningless statements.</p>
  <p>There is one more, shall we say, similarity,<br>between the word book and human.</p>

  <p>Let us go back to our childhood,<br>and revise a group of world.</p>
  <p>The word spirit, soul, or even ghost,<br>was explained to us as this thing that floats in the air.</p>
  <p>But actually, the truth, is that,<br>spirits live in books.</p>
  <p>A book worth keeping,<br>is a kind of eternity.</p>

  <p>You see this isn't just about you reading books,<br>but you reading your way towards becoming a writer.</p>
  <p>So that you spirit will be captured in your works,<br>and depending on how well you write either titillate or frighten.</p>
  <p>It is very important that you become a writer,<br>hundreds of years from now as we live long and take to space and beyond.</p>
  <p>Little known books will become a rare delight,<br>and even before such fancy people deserve to feel you.</p>

  <p>In this way it is true that we can communicate with spirits,<br>because we can reconstruct a version of the author and learn from them.</p>
  <p>The spirits that books keep,<br>represent a precious one of a kind. intellectual inheritance.</p>
  <p>More than just befriending the author and asking,<br>"What would she do in this situation."</p>
  <p>Books allow us to inherit the authors, and sometimes their characters' lifetimes,<br>they help us enter the plateau that they climbed and now rest upon.</p>

  <p>Inheriting lifetimes is a precious talent of ours,<br>one that we should make frequent use of.</p>

  <p>In a funny book written by a recovering alcoholic,<br>I noticed this terrifying passage written in context of drinking alcohol - something I always stay away from.</p>
  <p>"If you hang around the barbershop long enough,<br>you'll eventually get a haircut."</p>
  <p>Here <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Maarten_Troost">J. Maarten Troost</a> delivers a lesson that we don't have to learn,<br>that we can just inherit, and <strong>completely</strong> avoid.</p>
  <p>There are many more mistakes that we can avoid in a similar fashion,<br>I think this is by far the most powerful thing about books.</p>

  <p>This is what it means to inherit from a book,<br>to hear about the struggle, or challenge, and take into our heart.</p>
  <p>To know where the tragedies are,<br>and go all the way around, and have that, much, more, life, to experience.</p>

  <p>Asking how many books do you have to read is OK, but a bit silly,<br>in a way you only ever really love the top 10.</p>
  <p>If you were lucky enough to instantly discover your ten books,<br>then the answer is you only need ten of them.</p>

  <p>If it is wisdom that you are after, if you care about being powerful!,<br>then 10,000 is guaranteed to light a fire like non other.</p>

  <p>There is still one more important thing you should know about books,<br>a book in its paper form is the most primitive version.</p>

  <p>Here you will discover a great pleasure,<br>in re-listening and re-learning from books.</p>
  <p>This is a great power, as each time you re-listen you grow in wisdom,<br>and each time you become wiser you understand more of the book.</p>
  <p>Here my favorite example is a group of books,<br>written and sometimes read by Bill Bryson.</p>
  <p>I enjoy re-listening <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a> the most,<br>there is always litter something I forgot, and something I end up understanding a bit more.</p>

  <p>Do not worry too much about the great challenge of writing your own books,<br>it happens automatically when you have something interesting to say.</p>
  <p>You just sit down and write,<br>later you divide it all up into separate books.</p>
  <p>And perhaps pen a few more,<br>once you ask yourself if people of the future will be able to reconstruct your spirit in full.</p>
  <p>Take to great adventures,<br>and don't get lost in mistakes that Humanity keeps propagating.</p>

  <p>Part of the reason why writing is so important,<br>is helping the future generations start understanding mistakes from where you left off.</p>
  <p>Climate, Poverty, Loss of Species, Pollution,<br>are not things that are meant to crush you.</p>
  <p>Those are the things,<br>that you have to help the younger generation understand.</p>
  <p>They need to understand it all, so that they don't have to start by breaking their way out of that mess,<br>and thus be forced to repeat the road you already traveled.</p>
  <p>But rather, start far above, where they can comprehend is mechanics,<br>and introduce systems of prevention that will help humanity, increase its pace of advancement.</p>

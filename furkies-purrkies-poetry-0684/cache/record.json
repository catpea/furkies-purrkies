  "text": "The word books is similar to the word humans,\nit is a very general label.\nNobody seriously says I don't like humans,\nlikewise, no one should ever say I don't like books.\nThose are silly things to say,\nin fact they are meaningless statements.\nThere is one more, shall we say, similarity,\nbetween the word book and human.\n\nLet us go back to our childhood,\nand revise a group of world.\nThe word spirit, soul, or even ghost,\nwas explained to us as this thing that floats in the air.\nBut actually, the truth, is that,\nspirits live in books.\nA book worth keeping,\nis a kind of eternity.\n\nYou see this isn't just about you reading books,\nbut you reading your way towards becoming a writer.\nSo that you spirit will be captured in your works,\nand depending on how well you write either titillate or frighten.\nIt is very important that you become a writer,\nhundreds of years from now as we live long and take to space and beyond.\nLittle known books will become a rare delight,\nand even before such fancy people deserve to feel you.\n\nIn this way it is true that we can communicate with spirits,\nbecause we can reconstruct a version of the author and learn from them.\nThe spirits that books keep,\nrepresent a precious one of a kind. intellectual inheritance.\nMore than just befriending the author and asking,\n\"What would she do in this situation.\"\nBooks allow us to inherit the authors, and sometimes their characters' lifetimes,\nthey help us enter the plateau that they climbed and now rest upon.\n\nInheriting lifetimes is a precious talent of ours,\none that we should make frequent use of.\nBecause we can then avoid problems,\nthat the books describe.\n\nIn a funny book written by a recovering alcoholic,\nI noticed this terrifying passage written in context of drinking alcohol - something I always stay away from.\n\"If you hang around the barbershop long enough,\nyou'll eventually get a haircut.\"\nHere J. Maarten Troost[1] delivers a lesson that we don't have to learn,\nthat we can just inherit, and completely avoid.\nThere are many more mistakes that we can avoid in a similar fashion,\nI think this is by far the most powerful thing about books.\n\nThis is what it means to inherit from a book,\nto hear about the struggle, or challenge, and take into our heart.\nTo know where the tragedies are,\nand go all the way around, and have that, much, more, life, to experience.\n\nAsking how many books do you have to read is OK, but a bit silly,\nin a way you only ever really love the top 10.\nIf you were lucky enough to instantly discover your ten books,\nthen the answer is you only need ten of them.\n\nIf it is wisdom that you are after, if you care about being powerful!,\nthen 10,000 is guaranteed to light a fire like non other.\nBut realistically, you need to have a good time reading a book,\nyou need wintry walks in the park, lazy days at a lake-or-ocean beach.\n\nThere is still one more important thing you should know about books,\na book in its paper form is the most primitive version.\nThe best kind of book,\nis a book cheerfully narrated by its author.\n\nHere you will discover a great pleasure,\nin re-listening and re-learning from books.\nThis is a great power, as each time you re-listen you grow in wisdom,\nand each time you become wiser you understand more of the book.\nHere my favorite example is a group of books,\nwritten and sometimes read by Bill Bryson.\nI enjoy re-listening A Short History of Nearly Everything[2] the most,\nthere is always litter something I forgot, and something I end up understanding a bit more.\n\nDo not worry too much about the great challenge of writing your own books,\nit happens automatically when you have something interesting to say.\nYou just sit down and write,\nlater you divide it all up into separate books.\nAnd perhaps pen a few more,\nonce you ask yourself if people of the future will be able to reconstruct your spirit in full.\nTake to great adventures,\nand don't get lost in mistakes that Humanity keeps propagating.\n\nPart of the reason why writing is so important,\nis helping the future generations start understanding mistakes from where you left off.\nClimate, Poverty, Loss of Species, Pollution,\nare not things that are meant to crush you.\nThose are the things,\nthat you have to help the younger generation understand.\nThey need to understand it all, so that they don't have to start by breaking their way out of that mess,\nand thus be forced to repeat the road you already traveled.\nBut rather, start far above, where they can comprehend is mechanics,\nand introduce systems of prevention that will help humanity, increase its pace of advancement.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Maarten_Troost\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything",

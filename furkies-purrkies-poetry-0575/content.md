We all need to start somewhere,
and with a place for a comfortable armchair.

A laboratory is perfect for that,
plus it is a nice place to rest at.

A secret laboratory is great,
but it can be as small as your 3D printer plate.

So as long as you don’t make a big boom,
you can probably event setup in the living room.

---

But above all it is about a solid start,
to all your unique art.

Use a projector to start painting,
you can outline anything.

Get an [Ender][e],
and print a screw you generated in [Blender][b].

Easy peasy meow,
and you can start right now.

It is all about starting and then moving along,
and this path is life long.

We don’t know why we have fake education,
but it affects every person in every nation.

Eventually it will catch up to them,
and it will be up to you to fix the mayhem.

Even wining a great prize,
will not fix problems that are about to arise.

The world needed real schools and real wisdom,
but we ended up with a broken system.

Now we have to teach the world to grow,
but this is a talent that the self-taught know.

To make real changes right now,
you will need to replace schools somehow.

Real education will soon be in real need,
and the world will need a leader that can lead.

---

The world does not need to unite to look up to you,
it needs leaders that will teach, inspire, and stay true.

It needs you in narrated books,
so that everyone can learn from you despite all the crooks.

Due to climate and political change,
the new schools need to have a wider range.

Lectures can’t be cut up by some abstract subject,
they must be self guided and actually connect.

The world is not coming to an end,
but education is something that we must fix and defend.

---

It all needs a simple start,
and there is nothing more pleasant than beginning with art.

Then move onto computers, programming, and design,
and make all your lessons connect and align.

Once you get a taste for real education and school,
it will become your most powerful tool.

Then all you need to do is help others to the same,
and that is not an impossible aim.

Once the idea of self education takes root,
wisdom and real education will bear fruit.

The next generations will take it from there,
they will view climate change as something they can repair.

---

Rather than bringing all the students to school,
create a new tool.

Bring the school to all the students, to that they can learn for real,
[in a place where there are no paycheck to steal][s].

Self paced and self guided learning for real is fun,
and at every step of the way the students will feel they have won.

No one will have to ask them to pay attention,
they will be too busing building some invention.

The future is always bright,
but we must help the world learn for real, and keep things right.

Each generation, must guard real education,
despite all the borders we are one family, one real nation.

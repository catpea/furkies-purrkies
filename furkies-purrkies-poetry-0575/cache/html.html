  <p>We all need to start somewhere,<br>and with a place for a comfortable armchair.</p>
  <p>A laboratory is perfect for that,<br>plus it is a nice place to rest at.</p>
  <p>A secret laboratory is great,<br>but it can be as small as your 3D printer plate.</p>
  <p>So as long as you don’t make a big boom,<br>you can probably event setup in the living room.</p>

  <p>But above all it is about a solid start,<br>to all your unique art.</p>
  <p>Use a projector to start painting,<br>you can outline anything.</p>
  <p>Get an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ender+3+v2+assembly">Ender</a>,<br>and print a screw you generated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+tutorial">Blender</a>.</p>
  <p>Easy peasy meow,<br>and you can start right now.</p>
  <p>It is all about starting and then moving along,<br>and this path is life long.</p>

  <p>We don’t know why we have fake education,<br>but it affects every person in every nation.</p>
  <p>Eventually it will catch up to them,<br>and it will be up to you to fix the mayhem.</p>
  <p>Even wining a great prize,<br>will not fix problems that are about to arise.</p>
  <p>The world needed real schools and real wisdom,<br>but we ended up with a broken system.</p>
  <p>Now we have to teach the world to grow,<br>but this is a talent that the self-taught know.</p>
  <p>To make real changes right now,<br>you will need to replace schools somehow.</p>
  <p>Real education will soon be in real need,<br>and the world will need a leader that can lead.</p>

  <p>The world does not need to unite to look up to you,<br>it needs leaders that will teach, inspire, and stay true.</p>
  <p>It needs you in narrated books,<br>so that everyone can learn from you despite all the crooks.</p>
  <p>Due to climate and political change,<br>the new schools need to have a wider range.</p>
  <p>Lectures can’t be cut up by some abstract subject,<br>they must be self guided and actually connect.</p>
  <p>The world is not coming to an end,<br>but education is something that we must fix and defend.</p>

  <p>It all needs a simple start,<br>and there is nothing more pleasant than beginning with art.</p>
  <p>Then move onto computers, programming, and design,<br>and make all your lessons connect and align.</p>
  <p>Once you get a taste for real education and school,<br>it will become your most powerful tool.</p>
  <p>Then all you need to do is help others to the same,<br>and that is not an impossible aim.</p>
  <p>Once the idea of self education takes root,<br>wisdom and real education will bear fruit.</p>
  <p>The next generations will take it from there,<br>they will view climate change as something they can repair.</p>

  <p>Rather than bringing all the students to school,<br>create a new tool.</p>
  <p>Bring the school to all the students, to that they can learn for real,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">in a place where there are no paycheck to steal</a>.</p>
  <p>Self paced and self guided learning for real is fun,<br>and at every step of the way the students will feel they have won.</p>
  <p>No one will have to ask them to pay attention,<br>they will be too busing building some invention.</p>
  <p>The future is always bright,<br>but we must help the world learn for real, and keep things right.</p>
  <p>Each generation, must guard real education,<br>despite all the borders we are one family, one real nation.</p>

That is what innovation is all about,
the secret, is out.

Poking at some things for a while,
will help you out-compete competition by a mile.

But pay attention to the poetry of the thing,
set your aims aside and don't cling.

You invent by combining pieces that _already_ fit together,
your invention has to be light as a feather.

It is meant to lift you out,
so you don't have to work as hard as a trout.

Every one of us is an inventor at heart,
and we are all very smart.

In fact... there isn't a person that is smarter than you!
invention is a function of a breakthrough.

You just have to grab onto the things you like,
and take them with you on a loooooooong hike.

And just let them fit together naturally until they click,
and you'll have your new invention very quick.

But you have to think about it, and be rested, and relax,
that when your mind will purr to the max.

Yeah, don't let your self think that inventors are super smart,
inventing is just another form of art.

It takes a little bit of practice, but not _too_ much,
it is not about superpowers or some such.

Find a bunch of things that you like,
go on a hike, or ride your bike, and wait for the new idea to strike.

Even something as simple as a colorful wide-rubber-band,
can become a new class of wallet that will hold phone. remote, car keys and cards in a tight package that will fit your hand.

There is absolutely no limit to what you can invent,
but you must let go of the original intent.

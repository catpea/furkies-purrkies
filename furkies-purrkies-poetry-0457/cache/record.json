  "text": "Above all,\nknow that this is a process.\nBecause we are susceptible to false beliefs,\nwe must always be on a lookout for things that do not seem quite right.\n\nMy go to simple example is the fact that we live in a state of Mutually Assured Destruction,\nthere are about 2,000 ready-to-launch nuclear weapons that can be immediately deployed to destroy the world.\nMy extreme example that is really hard to believe,\nis wage slavery, most people will deny it, resist it, and call me crazy for it.\nHaving your children living paycheck-to-paycheck always under the cloud of medical and student debt,\nis wrong, humanity will not progress in this state.\n\nOf course you can't just believe me,\nbecause that is how problems like this start in the first place.\nYou have to figure it out on your own,\nwhich is to say, build a path, at a steadily increasing slope, paved with a thousand books written by people wiser than their critics.\nThe way you find out if a person is wise or not,\nis by working your way up to that, by reading books.\nNo one can tell you which books tot start with,\nbut you can be certain that it is many books, and in the beginning most of them will be narrated for you.\nThe way to find these books,\nis to dig through best seller lists.\nFor example right now you may wish to look for top 10 audio books from year 2020,\nor for award winning audio books, more specifically look up Audie Awards[1] (as in a.u.d.i.e).\n\nSome Philosophers have flaws, but don't throw away their work,\ntake it under your wings, make it better.\nIt is a sacred thing,\nto bring beauty and innocence to some beautiful philosophy once stained by a madman.\nIn my experience Thinkers are Funny, and Profound,\nsometimes having made mistakes in their youth, is the very thing that launches them into that Love of Wisdom that immortalizes them.\nSo if you find a work of philosophy that is not perfect,\nsee if maybe your beauty can restore and fix it, try to save the work; rather than letting the ugly person drag it down into the darkness with him.\n\nAside from flaws and repairs, or perhaps forgiveness,\nyou will also find that most books will teach you indirectly.\nMost of the time, the title has nothing to do what the book is about,\nand the book will teach you a wisdom that has little to do with the main story.\n\nNow, I always encourage non-fiction books, but I don't just mean scientific books, or philosophy and psychology,\nI think of memoirs and biographies as essential reading.\nHere, reading about someone raised in a strange culture or family, can be _absolutely_ the most powerful thing in context of breaking out of some indoctrination.\nas the reader will be able to see their own invisible misfortune, by the magic of subtle analogy, to the events in the book that they are reading.\nOften, different people reading or listening to the same book,\nwill get a slightly different story out of it.\nThis relates to the level of their knowledge, to where their curiosities lie,\nto the ways that they like to think, and to what they think the book is about.\nIt it of some importance to add,\nthat every book a person reads, lifts them higher.\nThe height that this hints on,\nis the same height that Growing Up refers to.\n\nAfter a thousand books,\nit does not matter who took what out of which book.\nOr which books or Philosophers they disliked,\nor what they thought was under-thought, or could be made better in some way.\nAfter a thousand books, even after a hundred audio books (and what could possibly be easier than listening to a book on some some fancy adventure),\na person holds a solid dollop of wisdom in their being.\nIt is like a torch, a lamp,\nand it is that light that we use to continuously monitor for more wisdom.\nWhich brings us full circle to the beginning of this text,\nyou cannot be told what indoctrination you are stuck with, as that is the same mechanism that gets you stuck in the first place.\nYou have to build a wisdom, right in you, in your being,\nand that wisdom will enhance your perception, that is why we poetically refer to wisdom as a light - because it helps you see better.\nAs you continue gathering more and more wisdom,\nyou begin to see more and more, and you become less and less susceptible to false beliefs.\n\nAnd here I want to close with Plato's allegory of the cave[2],\nthe only way that we can truly, and meaningfully, help each other, is with knowledge.\nAnd not with any one book in particular,\nbut with a hundred, with a thousand, with ten thousand, and fathom more.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audie_Award\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQfRdl3GTw4",

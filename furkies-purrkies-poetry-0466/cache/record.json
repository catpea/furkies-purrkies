want to tell you what they will think of us.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In a real school, when actually learning for real,</p>\n  <p>getting snagged on something is no different then discovering something uniquely interesting about a subject.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not understanding something very well,</p>\n  <p>and wanting to understand something very much, is the same thing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In today&apos;s schools, one leads to being told to pay attention, or else,</p>\n  <p>and the other to the barbaric act of actually being punished.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think the first subject that people have difficulty with,</p>\n  <p>is mathematics.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Mathematics, is actually taught wrong,</p>\n  <p>the lectures are so broken, that they likely transformed into a memorization dog an pony show.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And memorization is not education,</p>\n  <p>it is just make-believe, it is just acting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There are teachers out there that can help students understand,</p>\n  <p>but it is actually really bad for the classroom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Because lovingly teaching all students to understand all the concepts,</p>\n  <p>will require far more time then what a class has before the final.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There will not be enough time to cover all the concepts,</p>\n  <p>the class curriculum is not meant for real education, but mere memorization.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The bureaucracy of the school,</p>\n  <p>does not care that you are educated, they only care that you pass the tests.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What is there to be done in this situation?</p>\n  <p>that part is really easy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I call it &quot;The Million Student March&quot;,</p>\n  <p>but don&apos;t worry, you don&apos;t have to get up from your chair.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What you have to do is stop pretending,</p>\n  <p>your willingness to cram, to memorize, is helping this strange theater carry on.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have to stop pretending that memorization is an education,</p>\n  <p>and start learning for real, on your own.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And this part is really, really, important,</p>\n  <p>there are some subjects that are so important, that without their knowledge you will be immanently tricked.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Stop memorizing for school,</p>\n  <p>and start learning for real.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Learn Chemistry, Microbiology, Your Biology and how the Human Body operates,</p>\n  <p>and either take up an interest in Astrobiology, Medicine, or Combinatorial Genomics; follow your curiosity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You need to know about physics, don&apos;t worry about the formulas - as that comes next, and it can&apos;t be easier,</p>\n  <p>learn about circus, electricity, and build your own models that for example recharge batteries with solar power.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For the love of all things amazing, get some wires, batteries, a multi-meter,</p>\n  <p>and especially analog Amp and Volt gauges to see them come to life.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You need to learn how to built a radio,</p>\n  <p>and you need to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo-km-qfJe8\">build a tiny transmitter</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are free to learn all the cool things now,</p>\n  <p>you can lean anything.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And there is a very special subject,</p>\n  <p>that as everything else has been horribly misrepresented.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And this particular goodie,</p>\n  <p>grants you the ability to get inside any system of any complexity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This subject is so powerful that you can do experiments on spacetime it self,</p>\n  <p>by actually simulating sustained acceleration for prolonged periods such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)\">Project Orion</a> describes,</p>\n  <p>and run tests on things like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity\">gravitational singularities</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I am of course describing,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGeT8IyKd2M\">Programming</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Programming is how you learn mathematics for real,</p>\n  <p>for one, the notation is consistent, <a href=\"https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code\">as Math As Code states: &quot;Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study&quot;</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t worry, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmJ-4B-mS-Y\">school wasn&apos;t teaching you real math anyway</a>,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4\">you were just learning an easy to pretend-to-learn fragment mostly for the bureaucrats, and so that the teachers would keep getting paid</a>,</p>\n  <p>the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs\">real math is actually pretty cool</a> and full of interesting mysteries.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But you can&apos;t approach, neural networks or combinatronics for example, directly,</p>\n  <p>the way school presents these subjects is basically toxic, insane, deadly, and crazy - it is deeply heartless.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The right way to approach neural networks,</p>\n  <p>is by looking at <a href=\"https://brain.js.org/#/examples\">Simple Letter Detection or maybe Color Contrast examples over at brain.js</a>,</p>\n  <p>and follow up with a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=neural+networks+explained\">couple of videos</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think even more illustrative of the need for programming is combinatronics,</p>\n  <p>and the way you would get at it, is by cracking passwords in a cute little hacker game that you would program as part of learning programming.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The complicated subjects in mathematics,</p>\n  <p>are so trivial in the programming word, that no programmer dares to say a thing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Start learning programming by taking to JavaScript,</p>\n  <p>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4\">Learning how to mess around with P5.js</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Once you advance, even if just a little bit,</p>\n  <p>you will be able to create a lecture based on the path you took.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Other people working on the same subject,</p>\n  <p>will be able to help you more, if you collaborate with them on a beautiful interactive lecture.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A lecture is a work of art,</p>\n  <p>different people may wish to take a unique path through it, but it really comes down to the presentations and visualizations.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Biology is a very interesting subject to study and learn about from simulations on a computer,</p>\n  <p>it is only one little step to get to medicine, and if you can do both you, you can be pretty sure, that computers are the future.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Can you learn mathematics without Programming,</p>\n  <p>no, no you can&apos;t.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There are some people that like that kind of thing,</p>\n  <p>but for them complexity is something that they need, it is not just about learning math for them, they are choosing the hard way to meditate.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Programming is the first thing you have to learn,</p>\n  <p>as it wraps all the other things.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It makes everything simple,</p>\n  <p>and puts impossible things within your reach.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Computers provide the much needed info-graphics, visualizations, interactivity, control and interaction,</p>\n  <p>when it comes to the creation of lectures for the new class of real schools.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They also provide humanity with a program, that we can call School 1.0,</p>\n  <p>call it Virtual Reality School, call it school on a chip, call it a cool computer game.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A computer program that will be able to run on low powered devices,</p>\n  <p>that will gently step through the much needed real lectures towards a Real Education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The subject I am looking forward to the most is not computers or programming but,</p>\n  <p>Philosophy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBmlRihA9_s\">Philosophy has been destroyed by schools</a>,</p>\n  <p>it became irrelevant to our lives.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But Philosophy is actually the story of Humanity&apos;s Childhood,</p>\n  <p>it is the greatest story that has hardly ever been told.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And what is fantastic about teaching Philosophy from a little computer device,</p>\n  <p>is that it is a dramatized Audio Book, it is probably a thousand hours long, and recorded by countless students, in all our languages.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Philosophy lectures on this portable school device that your generation will begin work on,</p>\n  <p>will be hailed as one of the greatest achievements of human kind, it will be seen as the New Wonder Of The World.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The way towards Wold Peace, and Unity,</p>\n  <p>is always near, but it requires collective courage.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It requires that you stop memorizing,</p>\n  <p>and stand up for your generation, and the future of this world,</p>\n  <p>that you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\">stand up for real education</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Personal Note,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If I,</p>\n  <p>may.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Walk up to the students being punished,</p>\n  <p>and let them know you memorized and don&apos;t understand it either.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Help them understand that they are not stupid,</p>\n  <p>it is just that school is broken.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You don&apos;t have to become their friend,</p>\n  <p>just save them from the toxicity of stress, that can often destroy a mind by pushing them off-course into self medication, with food or alcohol, or worse.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Make sure that the students in the back know,</p>\n  <p>that there is nothing wrong with them.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Most of the time they are scared of becoming homeless,</p>\n  <p>which is exactly what the bully will drive them into.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let them know that they don&apos;t have to be scared,</p>\n  <p>and it is actually kind of good that they are already upset at the dog an pony show.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As ultimately, all the A student will find that their work life ended up becoming toxic,</p>\n  <p>and that why they really needed was to work for themselves, where they could take better care of their mental health.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just tell all the students being punished</p>\n  <p>to begin practicing to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM\">build their own company</a>, by building dozens of little ones to help them understand how to do it right.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is what everyone will want,</p>\n  <p>eventually.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,</p>\n  <p>to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,</p>\n  <p>discover that I had not lived.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I did not wish to live what was not life,</p>\n  <p>living is so dear;</p>\n  <p>nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,</p>\n  <p>to live so sturdily and

acting.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The force is pretty formidable,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they will be punished with grades, that will destroy their GPA, and in some cases sent to prison, the prison of repeating a year.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The future generations will never forgive us for this,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I don't event want to tell you what they will

<div class=\"paragraph\">In a real school, when actually learning for real,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">getting snagged on something is no different then discovering something uniquely interesting about a subject.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Not understanding something very well,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and wanting to understand something very much, is the same thing.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In today's schools, one leads to being told to pay attention, or else,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the other to the barbaric act of actually being punished.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I think the first subject that people have difficulty with,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is mathematics.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Mathematics, is actually taught wrong,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the lectures are so broken, that they likely transformed into a memorization dog an pony show.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And memorization is not education,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it is just make-believe, it is just acting.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There are teachers out there that can help students understand,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but it is actually really bad for the classroom.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Because lovingly teaching all students to understand all the concepts,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">will require far more time then what a class has before the final.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There will not be enough time to cover all the concepts,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the class curriculum is not meant for real education, but mere memorization.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The bureaucracy of the school,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">does not care that you are educated, they only care that you pass the tests.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">What is there to be done in this situation?</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that part is really easy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I call it \"The Million Student March\",</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but don't worry, you don't have to get up from your chair.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">What you have to do is stop pretending,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">your willingness to cram, to memorize, is helping this strange theater carry on.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You have to stop pretending that memorization is an education,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and start learning for real, on your own.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And this part is really, really, important,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there are some subjects that are so important, that without their knowledge you will be immanently tricked.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Stop memorizing for school,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and start learning for real.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Learn Chemistry, Microbiology, Your Biology and how the Human Body operates,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and either take up an interest in Astrobiology, Medicine, or Combinatorial Genomics; follow your curiosity.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You need to know about physics, don't worry about the formulas - as that comes next, and it can't be easier,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">learn about circus, electricity, and build your own models that for example recharge batteries with solar power.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">For the love of all things amazing, get some wires, batteries, a multi-meter,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and especially analog Amp and Volt gauges to see them come to life.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You need to learn how to built a radio,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and you need to <span>build a tiny transmitter<sup>[1]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You are free to learn all the cool things now,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you can lean anything.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And there is a very special subject,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that as everything else has been horribly misrepresented.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And this particular goodie,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">grants you the ability to get inside any system of any complexity.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This subject is so powerful that you can do experiments on spacetime it self,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">by actually simulating sustained acceleration for prolonged periods such as <span>Project Orion<sup>[2]</sup></span> describes,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and run tests on things like <span>gravitational singularities<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I am of course describing,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><span>Programming<sup>[4]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Programming is how you learn mathematics for real,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">for one, the notation is consistent, <span>as Math As Code states: \"Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study\"<sup>[5]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Don't worry, <span>school wasn't teaching you real math anyway<sup>[6]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><span>you were just learning an easy to pretend-to-learn fragment mostly for the bureaucrats, and so that the teachers would keep getting paid<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the <span>real math is actually pretty cool<sup>[8]</sup></span> and full of interesting mysteries.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But you can't approach, neural networks or combinatronics for example, directly,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the way school presents these subjects is basically toxic, insane, deadly, and crazy - it is deeply heartless.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The right way to approach neural networks,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is by looking at <span>Simple Letter Detection or maybe Color Contrast examples over at brain.js<sup>[9]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and follow up with a <span>couple of videos<sup>[10]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I think even more illustrative of the need for programming is combinatronics,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the way you would get at it, is by cracking passwords in a cute little hacker game that you would program as part of learning programming.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The complicated subjects in mathematics,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">are so trivial in the programming word, that no programmer dares to say a thing.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Start learning programming by taking to JavaScript,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and <span>Learning how to mess around with P5.js<sup>[11]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Once you advance, even if just a little bit,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you will be able to create a lecture based on the path you took.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Other people working on the same subject,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">will be able to help you more, if you collaborate with them on a beautiful interactive lecture.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A lecture is a work of art,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">different people may wish to take a unique path through it, but it really comes down to the presentations and visualizations.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Biology is a very interesting subject to study and learn about from simulations on a computer,</div>\n  <div

without Programming,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">no, no you can't.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There are some people that like that kind of thing,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but for them complexity is something that they need, it is not just about learning math for them, they are choosing the hard way to meditate.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Programming is the first thing you have to learn,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">as it wraps all the other things.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It makes everything simple,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and puts impossible things within your reach.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Computers provide the much needed info-graphics, visualizations, interactivity, control and interaction,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">when it comes to the creation of lectures for the new class of real schools.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">They also provide humanity with a program, that we can call School 1.0,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">call it Virtual Reality School, call it school on a chip, call it a cool computer game.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A computer program that will be able to run on low powered devices,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that will gently step through the much needed real lectures towards a Real Education.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The subject I am looking forward to the most is not computers or programming but,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Philosophy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><span>Philosophy has been destroyed by schools<sup>[12]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it became irrelevant to our lives.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section

  "text": "What we need to talk about,\nis Art.\nSomehow,\nin all this incredible complexity of our Universe...\nA set of lectures by a magnificent teacher,\nwill always beat the snot out of the best AI.\n\nThat is why I say that our Life and Mind,\nshould be a Masterpiece, that it is a work of art.\nThe best lessons, that teach us the most,\nmust be crafted by an artist.\nA powerful, knowledgeable, wise, and inspirational teacher,\nsomeone that knows the weaknesses, and loves to help.\n\nThere is one itsy-bitsy little bit, that is highly computerized,\nand that is the path that students take through the lectures.\nSee not everyone is interested in all the things the lecture holds,\nso a set of lectures has to be flexible, and that means computerized.\nAnd this is great, because it means the teacher gives the lecture once,\nand then it becomes infinitely re-playable, by an infinite number of students.\n\nBut please note that this is the simplest lecture model,\nit is best used for teachers that are deeply connected to their lecture.\nSingle-teacher lectures,\nare primary for the purpose of honoring the teachers and their art of teaching.\n\nThe standard lecture format,\nis very similar to a wikipedia category.\nThere are many students,\ncontinuously improving the various lectures in the set.\nAnd let me just say that they are all volunteers,\nmoney-making or hoarding has no place in education.\nSchool and Knowledge is meant to be free,\notherwise it is just fraud, perpetrated on the future generations.\n\nIt is more than volunteers,\nand quality of the lectures.\nIt is also the usefulness,\nand the clarity.\n\nToday, when a student does not understand mathematics,\nthey are encouraged and forced to pretend to understand it by memorization, by acting.\nThe force is pretty formidable,\nthey will be punished with grades, that will destroy their GPA, and in some cases sent to prison, the prison of repeating a year.\nThe future generations will never forgive us for this,\nI don't event want to tell you what they will think of us.\n\nIn a real school, when actually learning for real,\ngetting snagged on something is no different then discovering something uniquely interesting about a subject.\nNot understanding something very well,\nand wanting to understand something very much, is the same thing.\nIn today's schools, one leads to being told to pay attention, or else,\nand the other to the barbaric act of actually being punished.\n\nI think the first subject that people have difficulty with,\nis mathematics.\nMathematics, is actually taught wrong,\nthe lectures are so broken, that they likely transformed into a memorization dog an pony show.\nAnd memorization is not education,\nit is just make-believe, it is just acting.\nThere are teachers out there that can help students understand,\nbut it is actually really bad for the classroom.\nBecause lovingly teaching all students to understand all the concepts,\nwill require far more time then what a class has before the final.\nThere will not be enough time to cover all the concepts,\nthe class curriculum is not meant for real education, but mere memorization.\nThe bureaucracy of the school,\ndoes not care that you are educated, they only care that you pass the tests.\nWhat is there to be done in this situation?\nthat part is really easy.\nI call it \"The Million Student March\",\nbut don't worry, you don't have to get up from your chair.\nWhat you have to do is stop pretending,\nyour willingness to cram, to memorize, is helping this strange theater carry on.\nYou have to stop pretending that memorization is an education,\nand start learning for real, on your own.\nAnd this part is really, really, important,\nthere are some subjects that are so important, that without their knowledge you will be immanently tricked.\n\nStop memorizing for school,\nand start learning for real.\n\nLearn Chemistry, Microbiology, Your Biology and how the Human Body operates,\nand either take up an interest in Astrobiology, Medicine, or Combinatorial Genomics; follow your curiosity.\nYou need to know about physics, don't worry about the formulas - as that comes next, and it can't be easier,\nlearn about circus, electricity, and build your own models that for example recharge batteries with solar power.\nFor the love of all things amazing, get some wires, batteries, a multi-meter,\nand especially analog Amp and Volt gauges to see them come to life.\nYou need to learn how to built a radio,\nand you need to build a tiny transmitter[1].\nYou are free to learn all the cool things now,\nyou can lean anything.\n\nAnd there is a very special subject,\nthat as everything else has been horribly misrepresented.\nAnd this particular goodie,\ngrants you the ability to get inside any system of any complexity.\nThis subject is so powerful that you can do experiments on spacetime it self,\nby actually simulating sustained acceleration for prolonged periods such as Project Orion[2] describes,\nand run tests on things like gravitational singularities[3].\nI am of course describing,\nProgramming[4].\nProgramming is how you learn mathematics for real,\nfor one, the notation is consistent, as Math As Code states: \"Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study\"[5].\nDon't worry, school wasn't teaching you real math anyway[6],\nyou were just learning an easy to pretend-to-learn fragment mostly for the bureaucrats, and so that the teachers would keep getting paid[7],\nthe real math is actually pretty cool[8] and full of interesting mysteries.\n\nBut you can't approach, neural networks or combinatronics for example, directly,\nthe way school presents these subjects is basically toxic, insane, deadly, and crazy - it is deeply heartless.\nThe right way to approach neural networks,\nis by looking at Simple Letter Detection or maybe Color Contrast examples over at brain.js[9],\nand follow up with a couple of videos[10].\nI think even more illustrative of the need for programming is combinatronics,\nand the way you would get at it, is by cracking passwords in a cute little hacker game that you would program as part of learning programming.\nThe complicated subjects in mathematics,\nare so trivial in the programming word, that no programmer dares to say a thing.\nStart learning programming by taking to JavaScript,\nand Learning how to mess around with P5.js[11].\n\nOnce you advance, even if just a little bit,\nyou will be able to create a lecture based on the path you took.\nOther people working on the same subject,\nwill be able to help you more, if you collaborate with them on a beautiful interactive lecture.\nA lecture is a work of art,\ndifferent people may wish to take a unique path through it, but it really comes down to the presentations and visualizations.\n\nBiology is a very interesting subject to study and learn about from simulations on a computer,\nit is only one little step to get to medicine, and if you can do both you, you can be pretty sure, that computers are the future.\n\nCan you learn mathematics without Programming,\nno, no you can't.\nThere are some people that like that kind of thing,\nbut for them complexity is something that they need, it is not just about learning math for them, they are choosing the hard way to meditate.\nProgramming is the first thing you have to learn,\nas it wraps all the other things.\nIt makes everything simple,\nand puts impossible things within your reach.\n\nComputers provide the much needed info-graphics, visualizations, interactivity, control and interaction,\nwhen it comes to the creation of lectures for the new class of real schools.\nThey also provide humanity with a program, that we can call School 1.0,\ncall it Virtual Reality School, call it school on a chip, call it a cool computer game.\nA computer program that will be able to run on low powered devices,\nthat will gently step through the much needed real lectures towards a Real Education.\n\nThe subject I am looking forward to the most is not computers or programming but,\nPhilosophy.\nPhilosophy has been destroyed by schools[12],\nit became irrelevant to our lives.\nBut Philosophy is actually the story of Humanity's Childhood,\nit is the greatest story that has hardly ever been told.\nAnd what is fantastic about teaching Philosophy from a little computer device,\nis that it is a dramatized Audio Book, it is probably a thousand hours long, and recorded by countless students, in all our languages.\nThe Philosophy lectures on this portable school device that your generation will begin work on,\nwill be hailed as one of the greatest achievements of human kind, it will be seen as the New Wonder Of The World.\n\nThe way towards Wold Peace, and Unity,\nis always near, but it requires collective courage.\nIt requires that you stop memorizing,\nand stand up for your generation, and the future of this world,\nthat you stand up for real education[13].\n\nPersonal Note,\nIf I,\nmay.\nWalk up to the students being punished,\nand let them know you memorized and don't understand it either.\nHelp them understand that they are not stupid,\nit is just that school is broken.\nYou don't have to become their friend,\njust save them from the toxicity of stress, that can often destroy a mind by pushing them off-course into self medication, with food or alcohol, or worse.\nMake sure that the students in the back know,\nthat there is nothing wrong with them.\nMost of the time they are scared of becoming homeless,\nwhich is exactly what the bully will drive them into.\nLet them know that they don't have to be scared,\nand it is actually kind of good that they are already upset at the dog an pony show.\nAs ultimately, all the A student will find that their work life ended up becoming toxic,\nand that why they really needed was to work for themselves, where they could take better care of their mental health.\nJust tell all the students being punished\nto begin practicing to build their own company[14], by building dozens of little ones to help them understand how to do it right.\nIt is what everyone will want,\neventually.\n\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,\nto front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,\ndiscover that I had not lived.\nI did not wish to live what was not life,\nliving is so dear;\nnor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.\nI wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,\nto live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,\nto cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...\n-- Henry\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo-km-qfJe8\n[2]:

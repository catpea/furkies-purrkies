[People of the World are confused about complex issues][1],
even US Congress Members are not getting real answers and are forced to dumb their questions down.

Begin by writing a declaration of human rights,
from the perspective of the human, not the organization defining them.

declaration.json can be used to establish a new plateau for Human Rights and help in Advancement of Human Kind.

The JSON data format expressly states "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.",
the world has changed and this has become a real hope that should be adopted by other programs.

The data approach is inspired by the portability of todo.txt and resume.json,
and patterned after Cytoscape.js Elements JSON with which it should keep compatibility.

Editing is inspired by how operating systems manipulate filesystem data,
by means of multiple generic commands.

To effectively edit declaration.json a set of command line commands must be provided to help with its editing an maintenance,
A proper user interface is required for the end user.

I encourage you to consider using 128 bit UUID labels for each node as pictured below,
there will be many documents written for many purposes.

The document will undergo many changes on many platforms,
by many programmers of varying degree of skill, and the UUID approach greatly simplifies multi user editing.

Below you will find a sample document describing a user disagreement with bulk data collection.

Follow this format to help people reason about complex nested issues that we face today,
that we are unable to completely understand without graphs.

Provide the user with mind/concept mapping tools,
so that they can easy visualize their work.

Implement profiles for large documents such as public personal declarations,
so that a person is not faced with thousands of questions.

For example declaration.json - a document publicly declaring what the owner agrees/disagrees with,
should be simplified with profile combinations such as “Enhanced Human Rights”, or “Enhanced Security and Privacy”, “Enhanced Animal Rights”.

Each Human Being should aim to poses such a document publically or privatley,
companies should present a compatible document with their demands in a way that can be privately evaluated, where all the incompatibilities are listed in perfectly redable single sentence format.

This will allow busy and stressed out people to reason about incompatibilities,
and help them see elements previously obscured by legal gibberish.

You should be able to generate dashboards,
that help the people track the more dynamic components.

Not just the people but also Governments need your help, Congresswomen and Congressmen are unable to get clear answers from companies that engage in unusual practices,
this document format will allow them to get yes or no answers prior to congressional hearings.

Remember, Your Generations are the Hopes and Dreams of all the previous generations put together,
You are meant to grow in Knowledge, and Wisdom, and Become A Great Being.

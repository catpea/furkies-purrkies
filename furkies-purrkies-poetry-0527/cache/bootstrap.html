    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Learning astrophysics on your own, versus going to a fancy university<br>are two very different things, and guess which one you are going to be shamed for.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That's right people are going to laugh at you for learning on your own,<br>the teacher is probably going to laugh at you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">"How are you going to learn without grades,<br>without instruction, and who is going to hire you?"</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They aren't asking you questions, and they aren't making fun of you,<br>they are attempting to manipulate you to be like they are...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because your independence, is an enormous threat to their fantasy of education,<br>they are of course aware of their own pretending-to-learn.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And what is holding it all together,<br>is their hope that it will all come together in the last semester.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And when the final semester comes around,<br>they will just be focused on moving on.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The whole thing, to a starling degree,<br>is make believe.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Between 250,000 and 440,000 people die from medical errors,<br>each year.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Medical professionals have the same problem,<br>as all the other students.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is easy to pass the tests by cramming,<br>but that does not mean a person is educated for real.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If that was the case, then nobody would have a problem with retaking all the tests,<br>that led to their graduation, that today, serves as the proof of their knowledge.</div>

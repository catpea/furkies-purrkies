    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I wanted to share with you two links that were recently featured on HN,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28500422">25% of students age 16-32 take Adderall 1-7 times per week, not prescribed</a><br>and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28495941">Phony diagnoses hide high rates of drugging at nursing homes</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I'll quote from the second link about the "Phony diagnoses":<br>"[...] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28497780">My mum spent two decades as a primary schol teacher, and it's an open secret in that industry that Ritalin and other behavioural drugs are, at least in some cases, administered for the benefit of the teacher and other students in the class - not necessarily for the child receiving it.</a>"</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I fear that if schools continue teaching an ineffective curriculum, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi2nmx7XqB0">under pressure</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">what we may witness is not the repairs we need</a>, but, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY">fraudulent medication of the students just to get them to temporarily memorize for tests</a>.</div>

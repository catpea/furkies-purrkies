Sooner or later we will cure aging,
it is not known when, but it will be soon.
Don't assume that technology will stand still,
consider what the world was like just 50 years ago.
All our errors aside,
we are progressing very quickly.

To live forever,
requires that we become Knowledgeable and Wise.
We must take great care of our minds,
we must reject broken education and accept responsibility for self-education.
We must learn to manage stress,
and consider becoming independent entrepreneurs.
And we have to take good care of our bodies,
we need not become athletes, but we must live healthy lives.

No matter what the future holds,
we should consider writing books.
We should preserve snapshots of our wisdom as we continue growing,
so that others may follow.

Regardless of the future,
we should all quietly pursue excellence in things that matter to us.
Continue learning to no end,
improving ourselves and refining our aims as we grow wiser.
We mustn't be afraid to dream outrageous and futuristic dreams,
no matter what the future holds we should all aim to become great beings.
We should all work towards a beautiful,
lasting and meaningful body of knowledge.
We are all unique and very beautiful,
and all our achievements and thoughts, no matter if big or small mean a great deal to those on similar paths.
Let us all aim to become Wise,
and share the paths we took to get there.
May you dream of forever,
and travel to the most distant of planets.

  "text": "There is little to stop life's misfortunes from happening,\nbut we can learn to face them in great dignity.\n\nAll misfortunes can be conquered with wisdom,\nthe act of rising from misfortunes grants our life a greater meaning.\n\nWith what we learn we can spare others the same pains,\nthusly making our own aches count for more.\n\nIf all we have, to deal with great challenges,\nis a diploma and a career, than that will not be enough for us.\n\nWe need enough wisdom in our soul or the content of our character,\nto become in-compressible, and unbreakable.\n\nLife must go on, we must rise against all odds,\nno evil, no meaningless suffering, no liar is to hold us down.\n\nThe most powerful part of us that drives all the rest,\nis wisdom.\n\nWisdom is like a flower, and it grows within books,\nwhatever our challenge, great beings faced similar circumstance.\n\nAnd so that their aches did not get lost,\nthey turned them into wisdom, and the only way to reliably share wisdom is books.\n\nA well narrated book can give a person great strength in a very short time,\nand when our soul hurts the most our mind becomes extremely receptive to wisdom.\n\nIt is best, I think, to read books, or listen to their narrated versions,\nahead of time.\n\nBooks also enhance our decision making,\nso that we may avoid hopelessness altogether.\n\nThe only thing that can give us great trouble,\nis not having access to well respected and meaningful books that change lives with wisdom.\n\nBecause then we will need to rebuild the path to greatness from zero,\nand that may take decades if not more.\n\nThere is a problem with books because reading them is not the best way to inherit their wisdom,\nthe best way is to have them beautifully read to us.\n\nNot only that but in order to hear the narrator well,\nwe need a healthy mind and a balanced existence, a kind of a long and hard vacation.\n\nWe need the healing power of nature, of hills, trees, moss and fern,\nlittle woodland springs, an occasional beach, warm nights and fragrant mornings.\n\nTo understand a book, you need a fine narrator, and thick smell of pine trees,\na cracking bonfire or cabin fireplace, and the certainty of knowing that you have tomorrow for yourself as well.\n\nWe are unable to inherit knowledge from books when our life is stressful,\nin stress the best we can do is temporary memorize.\n\nBut we have to appreciate the content of what is being said,\nnot merely the words themselves, but the birth and life of the idea behind them.\n\nLearning requires the creation of a map or scaffold,\nand that can only be built when we love ourselves.\n\nAnd once wisdom finally takes root within us, it cannot be removed in any way, wisdom grows, almost on its own,\nit grants us solutions to new problems by subtle analogy to that which we already understand.\n\nAnd wisdom spreads, it is hard not to share good ideas,\nand it is hard to stop them from being shared.\n\nOnce equipped with wisdom,\nwe can hear the chains of misfortune dragging a mile away, and we are, in a way, ready.\n\nWe stand with the many others that we met in books, but now creating a family in time and space,\nand now we fully appreciate their struggles and eventual triumph, and them taking the time to share their hard won wisdom.\n\nAnd then we rise, we rise out of it all,\nin our struggle wisdom will bloom within us multiplying our strengths to no end.\n\nLater in life we will be able to heal others,\nhelp them with their thoughts and towards their own synthesis of wisdom, and helping them to become just as unbreakable.",

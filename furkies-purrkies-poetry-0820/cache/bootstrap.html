    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though I want to give an honorable mention to the runner up,<br>my second best idea is to keep Math Configuration and Geometry Manipulation apart.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Preferably by creating two components or groups with well defined properties,<br>first group would contain the bit of math that is always needed to get things right.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the second group, the object or property manipulations,<br>that influence the actual geometry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This way no matter how confusing or messy you math,<br>you are still reducing it to just a handful of output properties.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Which always tend to add up to the a solute minimum of values,<br>necessary to get your geometry setup in the geometry manipulation group.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is about dividing design complexity,<br>to tame it down and keep things simple and easy to manage.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because those separate pieces of plastic,<br>represent the geometric primitives you must first create in your program.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Those primitives,<br>are the starting point.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because to tame the complexity down,<br>what you are going to do...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Is start with the primitive,<br>and decorate around it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You are starting with the primitive that gets the decorations,<br>that makes the piece of plastic, that you later on have to assemble a bit.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The word decoration here is very important,<br>because that means that all you are doing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Is sending the geometry of your initial primitive,<br>down a single stream or wire.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Since the end result is a singe stand alone piece of plastic,<br>it means that stream of geometric information does not combine with anything.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">All you are doing is applying decorations,<br>or more precisely geometric transformations.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example, there are numerous things that feature,<br>in just a singe Superhero Belt Compartment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The cube primitive, the lid, the lid hinge, a handle to easily lift the hinge,<br>a tidy locking mechanism to click the lid in place.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then you have the lower hinge, belt loops in the back,<br>little feet because you can make a jewelry box out of it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There are also slide rails on the side to allow mini accessories,<br>one of which maybe a connector that an make a belt just out of the compartments.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then there are decorations for the front,<br>some kind of an easy to print motif that looks fierce regardless how tall the compartment is.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is the hole for the pin that connects the upper and lower hinge together,<br>the hole will need room to inset the pin head.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the pin should have a tactical looking head,<br>and allow for easy disassembly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">All of these little bits must be programmed in such a way,<br>as to make for an easy to follow visual programming program.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Let us take a look at a simpler variation,<br>where we only have the box and the lid, a pin, matching hinges, and a hole in the hinges.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When you visualize it on your 3D platter,<br>it is only 3 things, the main compartment, a lid, and a pin to hold the two together.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That means you can start with a cube for the compartment, a flat cube for the lid,<br>and a thin cylinder for the pin, three things... box, lid, and pin.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">See the compartment hole where you put things,<br>both the upper and lower hinge, the hole within them, are just decorations that you apply to the primitives.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One,<br>The main compartment cube gets decorated with a compartment hole,<br>a lower hinge, and a hole through the hinge.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Two,<br>The lid, gets decorated with a matching hinge,<br>and again a hole through the hinge.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Three,<br>Is your pin,<br>which in its simplest form is an undercorated cylinder primitive.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For those of you who are wondering about the holes for the pin,<br>those are also a cylinders, ever so slightly larger than the pin to make for a good friction fit.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But hole cylinders use Boo lean geometry,<br>they are subtracted from the hinge.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In closing, I would like to explain,<br>that this decoration flow, or process calls for two separate hole cylinders.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One to subtract a hole in the lid hinge,<br>and one to subtract a hole in the hinge of the main compartment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here, we are creating a separate line of decorations,<br>one for the lid, one for the compartment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This creates a single easy to comprehend line of decorations,<br>reusable components are fine, but they must be instantiated separately.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One fancy inset pin hole for the upper lid,<br>and one fancy pin hole for the lower lid.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is very important that the decoration process is one long line,<br>this way a year after you make your creation...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You will still be able to understand the decoration process,<br>and easily add ore remove decorators.</div>

  "text": "Let me just say, becoming a programmer is very easy,\nyou just need to stick your foot in the door.\n\nWhen I was little I was very fortunate to be introduced to the supremely user friendly Commodore 64,\nyou flip the switch and you get a prompt.\n\nAnd you can immediately start programming,\nyou also get what I call a cookbook, with very small and very clever, and useful recipes.\n\nGood recipes will help you dream a new program up,\nyou'll be able to splice what you need together, out of the bits of the recipes.\n\nDo it a few times, for a couple of different programs,\nand you are a programmer.\n\nToday, things are even easier,\nbut you have to start in the right place.\n\nPeople will try to tell you about programming web applications, phone apps, internet of things,\nor making window applications, and stuff like using online programming environments - don't listen - start small and strong.\n\nStart by writing a node.js based Linux program,\nfor your Raspberry Pi.\n\nDon't worry,\nyou never start from scratch.\n\nYou start with an existing project,\nand then you modify it.\n\nWhat project to start with?\nwe'll create it, together, right now.\n\nLet us call it,\nfragrance after a sophisticated french word.\n\nThe entry point is index.js, the main functions are stored in api.js, which is short for Application Programming Interface,\nand the little reusable functions sit in helpers.js.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi, that I recommend is the 8GB Raspberry Pi 4 Complete Starter Kit,\nbut get a super fancy keyboard, an extra fast 64GB Class 10 MicroSD card, a couple of monitors, and an extra Micro HDMI Cable.\n\nDon't forget to plug the fan into the 14th pin on the GPIO header,\nas that will let the operating system turn it on and off as needed.\n\nYou'll figure it all out,\na little bit of discomfort is good when learning amazing new things.\n\nUse nvm to install node,\nand clone the fragrance get inside the fragrance directory, and execute ```npm link```.\n\nIt lets you install it as a Linux command,\nbut you can still tinker with, it is like a local installation.\n\nUse grep to find all instances of the word fragrance,\nand change it to something nicer.\n\nLater on as you get the hang of things,\nsetup github, create a new repository, clone it down, copy your files into it, and push it up into your github.\n\nAnd now we arrive at the title question,\nwhat are programs?\n\nThey are your digital extensions,\nit cannot be said what programs do, because they do absolutely everything.\n\nYour programs are your magic spells,\nwhatever you want is just a few days of programming away.\n\nYou can't be told what you can do, there are cameras, robot arms, relay switches, chat bots, 2D and Text Games,\nCode Editors and visualization libraries like Cytoscape.js and D3 there are no limits.\n\nTo get a neat overview of what else is out there,\nsearch for Awesome node.js\n\nBut you can do,\neverything, on the server, in the web browser, in a window with electron, and on the Linux command line.\n\nYour program library is no different than your tool drawer,\nwhere you keep your screwdriver, pliers, your trusty hammer.\n\nYou only write or use programs when you need them,\nif you are interested in learning how to program, search the internet for node.js tutorials to get a better picture.\n\n\n[you flip the switch and you get a prompt]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBV_ASCLF4w\n[fragrance]: https://github.com/catpea/fragrance\n[8GB Raspberry Pi 4 Complete Starter Kit]: https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-complete-starter-kit.html\n[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\n[fragrance]: https://github.com/catpea/fragrance\n[Code Editors]: https://codemirror.net/6/\n[Cytoscape.js]: https://js.cytoscape.org/\n[D3]: https://d3js.org/\n[Awesome node.js]: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs\n[electron]: https://www.electronjs.org/\n[node.js tutorials]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=node+js+tutorial",

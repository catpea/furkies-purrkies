    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This exercise still relies on reference images,<br>positioned over the entire canvas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCVJyFHcb38">we first create line art</a>,<br>not exactly necessary, but it takes no effort, and it is very fun.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then a shadow layer,<br>which will require colorization.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Follow something like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJoJEyQiGxw">Marco Bucci's stylization tutorial</a><br>and possibly add one or two of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7cfW_ZEv10">Ross Tran's Five Tips</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Any tutorial on semi or high realism,<br>that deals with shadows that require color glazing.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This simple technique,<br>touches upon more traditional steps.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not as stable as working with photo reference directly,<br>and may cause getting stuck - like I just did with colors taking to long to finish.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But all the steps in shadow glazing tutorials,<br>will touch upon most of the concepts in art.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Color glazing is also used in oil painting,<br>so it is a neat introduction to topics outside of digital painting.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I left the nose an unusual color as I wish to depart from realism,<br>adding unusual light and possibly an oil painting texture.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Rather than making color more realistic,<br>I will try to create a new color theme.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is perhaps the best example,<br>of how art comes with its own teacher.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you just stretch a reference image over your entire canvas,<br>create line art based on that, and use it to check if your shadows are correct.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You are slowly, step by step exploring,<br>a more traditional way of creating art.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is very hard to get stuck here,<br>as the reference image is always near by.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So you are always moving forward,<br>and each step is always fascinating to explore.</div>

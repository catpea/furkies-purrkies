  <p>This exercise still relies on reference images,<br>positioned over the entire canvas.</p>
  <p>But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCVJyFHcb38">we first create line art</a>,<br>not exactly necessary, but it takes no effort, and it is very fun.</p>
  <p>And then a shadow layer,<br>which will require colorization.</p>
  <p>Follow something like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJoJEyQiGxw">Marco Bucci's stylization tutorial</a><br>and possibly add one or two of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7cfW_ZEv10">Ross Tran's Five Tips</a>.</p>
  <p>Any tutorial on semi or high realism,<br>that deals with shadows that require color glazing.</p>

  <p>This simple technique,<br>touches upon more traditional steps.</p>
  <p>It is not as stable as working with photo reference directly,<br>and may cause getting stuck - like I just did with colors taking to long to finish.</p>
  <p>But all the steps in shadow glazing tutorials,<br>will touch upon most of the concepts in art.</p>
  <p>Color glazing is also used in oil painting,<br>so it is a neat introduction to topics outside of digital painting.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/tjpzny/this_is_me/">The art challenge</a> presented only a black and white photo,<br>so it is interesting to try to color it - but there is no way to be sure the colors are correct.</p>
  <p>I left the nose an unusual color as I wish to depart from realism,<br>adding unusual light and possibly an oil painting texture.</p>
  <p>Rather than making color more realistic,<br>I will try to create a new color theme.</p>
  <p>If I had to create a realistic skin tone,<br>I would just use colors of a similar photo.</p>

  <p>This is perhaps the best example,<br>of how art comes with its own teacher.</p>
  <p>If you just stretch a reference image over your entire canvas,<br>create line art based on that, and use it to check if your shadows are correct.</p>
  <p>You are slowly, step by step exploring,<br>a more traditional way of creating art.</p>
  <p>It is very hard to get stuck here,<br>as the reference image is always near by.</p>
  <p>So you are always moving forward,<br>and each step is always fascinating to explore.</p>

  <p>What you may not be noticing,<br>that with each time you paint eyes, or nose, or lips...</p>
  <p>You are memorizing their structure,<br>in a way that is similar to how you navigate a city.</p>

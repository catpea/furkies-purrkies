thereof.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Musical rules are mean to be broken,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the best artists pretty much aim for it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But that is something you do on your own in your musical career,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but to get there you must first adopt a few rules as your favorite, as your initial style.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So let us make a simple melody, in modern times a program like lmms can show you which keys belong to what scale,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and then even automatically convert your notes to chords, so knowledge of music theory in not a requirement, at all.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Rather than showing you how to create things in sequence,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">which would be chords bass and melody, a task best left for a second tutorial.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I will show you how things sound when they stand alone,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">how vulnerable things are until they come together.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I will do this as proof, that if you have ever made a melody before,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">by drumming, or whistling, or creating your own words to a little song, you made a melody.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It was a perfect and beautiful melody,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but it was missing, the chords, and bass.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If you had all those things aligned together,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">then you would have a beautiful work of art on your hands.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Before we begin, I will say that a song needs a soul,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">lots of background sounds, that click together, but you can't quite hear where something starts and something ends.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is just the center, or the background of a song,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">these are called chords, multiple keys pressed together.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A chord is simply a complex and good sounding sound,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">made by pressing few piano keys together, at the same time.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">From time to time a chord can use some bass,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">bass are the deep sounding notes, they aren't always audible, very often you can't hear them at all on cheap speakers.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Bass fills in whatever chords missed,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Together bass and chords, create a universe of sound.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Your melody must be born of that universe,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">related to chords, but dominating the sound of the world, as if the melody was the sun.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Your melody, must not leave that world without great preparations,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">if you take just the melody part, it won't last on its own.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now let me show you what a melody outside of her universe sounds like,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and let me warn you, that it won't sound perfect,</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There are connectors here that fit the chords,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but there are no chords, yet.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">*MELODY PLAYS*</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now, before we get to the chords, the most complex sounding part of this melody,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">let me show you what the bass sounds like.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The bass is the proto-chord, it was once the original set of notes that sparked the melody,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but now, it lives beneath everything, it serves as the ground for both chords and melody.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Here, is what it sounds like, and again I must warn you that it is very dark,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it is very, scary (and hard to hear on cheap speakers).</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">*BASS PLAYS*</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And here we arrive at the chords, the oxygen, the lovely cumulonimbus,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but also the wind, and maybe the occasional gust as well.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Note how complete the chords are, there is nothing missing here,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the chords do not call for bass, nor are they in any way hurting when the melody is not playing.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">That means you can have a section of just the cords,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">perhaps with the bass to be consistent, but you do not need the melody to be playing.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This gives you the ability to let the listener rest from the for a bit,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">before you put it back in, and if you dare, and I hope you never do, you could have a stretch with just the bass, what audacity!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">*CHORDS PLAY*</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now time has come to assemble our song,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">let us see what bass and chords sound like without the melody.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">*BASS AND CHORDS PLAY*</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Whoo Wee, well that certainly doesn't sound like all hat no cows,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it sounds nice

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And now finally, let us add the high pitched melody,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">let us place it in the world that it belongs

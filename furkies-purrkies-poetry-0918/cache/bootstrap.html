    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When learning a new language,<br>context is everything.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Context supports meanings,<br>and supposed meanings.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is the fabric of a conversation,<br>and along with facial expression and body language...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You may sometimes wonder,<br>if perhaps it isnâ€™t so hard to lean a language even without textbooks.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As important as context in a new language you are trying to learn is,<br>it is a magnitude <strong>more</strong> important in more complex things.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example, it is the difference between taking a programming class,<br>and actually becoming a programmer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Taking a programming class, will have you write gibberish programs,<br>and test the worst kind of memorization, the temporary one.</div>

  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When you write real programs, you learn much more and much faster,<br>later on you can memorize a new language in less than 24 hours.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then hop along with boilerplate and tutorials,<br>to carve your own way through its ecosystem.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But the best way to learn, practice, stay current,<br>and entertain yourself, is by writing real programs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Static website generators for example,<br>basically just visit a directory to create a data list.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And you use that list to create pages for reading and browsing,<br>you pretty much just work with the simple list.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And slowly grow,<br>a layout directory with HTML templates.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But you are really,<br>just creating two things.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Article pages where a person can read the actual blog posts,<br>and a catalog with 20 links per page, with a pager on the bottom linking to more.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Your home page is just the first page of the catalog,<br>down on the bottom the user clicks Older or More to get a listing of 20 more links.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you have some text to publish, writing a static site generator,<br>would place you in a context that would ensure rapid self education.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Art too,<br>is a great example of the might of context.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I would wholeheartedly discourage all people,<br>from learning how to model 3D objects without a 3D printer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The 3D printer is the context, for the initial lessons in 3D modeling,<br>once you get your mesh all buttoned up, you print it out and put it on your key chain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You are not going to be able to stop learning 3D modeling,<br>it will be impossible, with those things on your key-chain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Later on you can branch out to sculpting and character animation,<br>but at first precision modeling is best.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In digital painting, when you apply reference images directly to your art,<br>you get to skip messing with proportions, something you will do later on anyways.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And dive right into Value, and Color Mixing,<br>and since you got the shapes right, you can paint your friends, or your selfies.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here you are always creating a recognizable portraits,<br>you are always improving and expanding your style.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Appreciation is an amazing reward for practicing Art,<br>in this context you will grow fast, merge many concepts and build a precious new universe.</div>

  <p>There is only one real way to make money,<br>and that is by helping your users build computer programs...</p>
  <p>On their phones,<br>in their free time.</p>
  <p>To do this in a way that isn’t annoying,<br>you have to guide them to keep programs simple.</p>
  <p>And let them interact with code or text,<br>instead of drag and drop and pinch and zoom.</p>
  <p>Be sure that the program structure<br>is just groups of sequential actions.</p>
  <p>They open their screen to names of groups,<br>can open a group to look at actions inside...</p>
  <p>and then configure actions, or stack functions,<br>and call other groups.</p>
  <p>To keep everyone on top of the program structure,<br>show them a simple map of all the actions.</p>
  <p>And of course,<br>create an action marketplace.</p>
  <p>Where users can request actions of features,<br>post bounties, maybe buy large sets of actions at a discount and so on.</p>
  <p>Actions are just small parts of program code,<br>that are ordered by the creators.</p>
  <p>And pierced,<br>by the data that passes through the sequence.</p>
  <p>It is called functional programming,<br>and it is so simple that it is trivial to create program maps.</p>

  <p>While this is not how modern User Interfaces are programmed,<br>the actions can have end user interface components attacked to them.</p>
  <p>For example, a user registration action,<br>can come with a user interface.</p>
  <p>It won’t be useful when programming,<br>but it will pop up when the stream or string of actions is executed.</p>
  <p>It makes sense that a user interface,<br>should be attached to a program component.</p>
  <p>And if you like this,<br>then know that this is it.</p>
  <p>But understand,<br>that you don't just show a form on the screen.</p>
  <p>But instead, you are chatting with a program,<br>in a conversational user interface.</p>
  <p>And it is chats all the way down,<br>from chatting with a robot about sending an email.</p>
  <p>To chatting with one<br>to compose a new song.</p>
  <p>This is how the old commuters worked,<br>and how chatbots work today.</p>

  <p>Put the user interface,<br>on the run-time end of your actions and your coders will never complain.</p>

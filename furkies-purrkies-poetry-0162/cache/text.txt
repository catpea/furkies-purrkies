Do not let unfairness crush or burden you,
rise up against it, and speak out.

Do not let anyone or anything make you feel tired,
tiredness will cloud your judgment until it is too late.

Do not let anything stand between you and sunshine,
the morning dew, the sleepy meadow, the red sunsets.

Do not let heartless cowards sell you on a cheap victory,
a True Warrior begins with wisdom, and grows inside out.

Learn to recognize the influence of isolation, fatigue, fear,
and let it fade, as it is not part of your personality.

Let go,
of past mistakes.

Learn to recognize that the younger you, was doing the best they thought they could,
but with less wisdom, less knowledge, less awareness, and less experience.

Growing up creates a great wall between the mistakes you might have made in your youth,
and the much wiser person you are today.

Dear Reader, if you - as you are today, would not do the same as the younger you,
then you need to stop blaming yourself; it is not your fault anymore.

Do, whatever else you must do to grow strong,
and turn your attention to the world, and to the future.

The future generations need help with their thoughts, with their concept of the world.
With the interpretation of their intellectual inheritance; history, books, stories, poems.

Help them avoid or overcome,
help them see the world better.

Use your hard earned wisdom,
to add to the world.

The children need your help, your wisdom, your knowledge, your experiences,
so that they can learn faster, avoid mistakes, see more, envision new heights.

Do not let children start at the same height you started,
do not push them to repeat the same path you already traveled.

The world can only grow,
when the new generation, stands on the shoulders of the one that came before it.

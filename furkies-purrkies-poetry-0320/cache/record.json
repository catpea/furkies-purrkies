  "text": "To show you how easy it is to learn when you are having fun\nin _this_ strange poem, we will be making a minimalist song together.\n\nIt won't be the most beautiful song as that would take a couple of days not hours,\nbut it will be a good start.\n\nWe will be using some unusual strategies,\nto smooth out the learning curve, so that our experience is fun.\n\nWe will be using a special effects tool that has a sound generator feature,\neach time we press a generator button, it will change a sound we are using to something else.\n\nThe program that does this is really smart,\nit has categories of sounds that the generator is good at.\n\nThose categories are straight from old computer games, and they are:\npick up/coin, laser/shoot, explosion, power up, hit/hurt, jump, and blip/select.\n\nTo save our ears from beeps and blips we are going to apply a hall effect with some echo and blending of sounds,\nto modernize the sound synthesizer a bit.\n\nLet us start,\nwith the drum kick.\n\nDance songs usually have a 130 beats per minute,\nso let us start with that, just in case the song will turn out nice.\n\nBecause we are using a random sound generator we can use lots of things to generate that drum kick sound,\nlaser/shoot, explosion, hit/hurt, and even jump.\n\nBut there is a trick here, it is also the reason why pianists don't just use one or two fingers,\npianists press multiple keys at the same time, to create a richer sound, called a CHORD.\n\nWe are going to do the same thing, we are going to mix laser/shoot and explosion, and hit/hurt, and jump,\nuntil we have a good sounding umph.\n\nNow a kick by it self is extremely boring,\nso let as add a clapping sound to it.\n\nA clapping sound, is still a kind of a drum sound,\nit is a little bit higher pitched, so it won't really blend with the boom of the drums.\n\nAnd to introduce complexity,\nwe are only going to put it every other kick.\n\nAnd I will use hit/hurt generator\nand still stack up a couple for them to get a chord, and to make sure it is not as deeply sounding as the kick.\n\nNow with the clapping sound breaking up the monotony of our drum,\nwe will add a hat sound, hats are those strange copper hats that drummers have next to drums.\n\nUnlike the clapping sound, which is every other beat,\nwe will add the high pitched hat sound, ON BEAT, AND BETWEEN BEAT, it is going to be all over the place.\n\nHats give our song energy,\nyou can't dance to hats, most of the time, but you can feel them in your body.\n\nYour feet maybe returning to the ground, and you may need to blend that motion by speeding up your feet,\nor you maybe doing the backwards t-step which requires two taps for every beat, sometimes matching the hats even.\n\nThe high frequency sound that is most frequent throughout the song,\ngives the song energy.\n\nBut a song has to live, it cannot just clone it self all the time,\nso now that we have the kick, the clapping, and the hat.\n\nWe have to alter, modify, warp the kick,\nnow the song will begin moving, the kick will be out of line, but also catch our ear.\n\nOur selection of instruments and that little variation,\ngives our song energy, life, and a soul.\n\nBut that is not yet enough,\nbecause the song has to breathe, it has to inhale and exhale.\n\nThat means we have to simplify something,\nthat we have to open the window to let the air in.\n\nAnd then we can resume,\nand then before the outtro we have to open the window again.\n\nFrom our perspective that just means,\nsimplifying and modifying the beat.\n\nFinally, a song needs a melody,\nwhere the back-beat that we just created is something that you tap your foot to, while the song is playing.\n\nA melody, is something you would whistle,\nafter the song got done playing.\n\nLets us call it the whistle rule,\nand that means the melody has to be short.\n\nAnd it also means that the instrument can't be a drum,\nit has to be something that is long and winding, a sustained sound.\n\n*song plays*",

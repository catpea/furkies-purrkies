  <p>It is hard to make money from programming all by yourself,<br>because the products you compete against are made by multiple people.</p>

  <p>I suspect most times, you are up against a startup that didn’t take off,<br>so there is four people with nothing to do.</p>
  <p>Only the huge startups that require money to stay afloat shut down,<br>the small clever ones transform and evolve.</p>
  <p>Here, they will see that they have failed, and look at the good decisions they made,<br>things they bought that really worked for them despite their failure.</p>
  <p>And it will just make sense,<br>to start producing those things for other startups.</p>
  <p>Here failure makes them strong, and mature,<br>it gives them powerful optics, clear vision.</p>
  <p>And by contrast, as fancy as their original idea was,<br>it now becomes a bitter sweet embarrassment.</p>
  <p>Usually the lesson they take away,<br>is do one thing well, and make sure customers are already waiting and willing to pay.</p>
  <p>In other words, they begin fixing problems,<br>that people have, and are ready to pay for.</p>

  <p>Sometimes programmers will hire other programmers,<br>especially if they are in country with a weak economy where code costs less per line.</p>
  <p>As ordinary as a group of friends,<br>making a startup is.</p>
  <p>The lone programmer,<br>is the opposite.</p>
  <p>They are a force of chaotic good, perfectly impenetrable genius,<br>and a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-21043693">Niagara fall of raw and unrefined creativity, unleashed</a>.</p>
  <p>But by far, the most intimidating side of their personality,<br>is a <a href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode/issues">sense of humor</a>, that has ages ago <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts">surpassed anything and everything</a>.</p>
  <p>The fuel behind their power, is the time,<br>their company pays for.</p>
  <p>A proper corporate programmer, works less than an hour a month,<br>and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32026639">it is considered a total failure to do any work at all</a>.</p>
  <p>Contrary to the stories, they don’t surf the internet,<br>that’s what news people writing these articles do.</p>
  <p>They build, they program, they invent, they solve impossible challenges,<br>they refine their skills, and they become a silent and invisible force of nature.</p>
  <p>Thousands of their computer programs are scattered across multiple accounts,<br>most of which they no longer care about.</p>
  <p>And although the code is hard to read,<br>and may mix tabs and spaces, it is as genius an anything by world renowned scientists.</p>
  <p>They just don’t give a s*it about rewards,<br>they like the challenge it self.</p>

  <p>This is where you start,<br>among the Great Hackers.</p>
  <p>Programmers so capable,<br>that they first laugh at the word hacker, and then they reinvent it to adorn themselves with.</p>
  <p>Your tools must be on point,<br>everything you do must be wise, and your choices, impressive.</p>
  <p>The path ahead of you if nothing short of enlightenment it self,<br>so it is hard to make mistakes here.</p>
  <p>Simply choose the greatest challenges,<br>and let them grant you powers to smash the ones that you once thought impossible.</p>

  <p>Choose the most popular programming language,<br>that will not slow you down with data types and memory management.</p>
  <p>Today and for foreseeable future that language is JavaScript,<br> it is often made fun of by people who chose the wrong languages to learn.</p>
  <p>Choose the hardest challenge,<br>that is well within your grasp, and goes in harmony with your programming language.</p>
  <p>Choose Code Generation as your mightiest challenge,<br>with friends or no friends.</p>
  <p>Code generation is a great teacher,<br>and it holds the promise of helping you automatically generate products for sale.</p>
  <p>The idea behind code generation is simple,<br>most of the code that is written is just fluff and boilerplate to glue all the pieces together.</p>
  <p>With code generation you just focuses on the important parts,<br>leaving all the boilerplate to the generator.</p>
  <p><a href="https://yeoman.io/authoring/file-system.html">Code generators use simple template engines</a>,<br>I recommend using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs">ejs</a> as it allows you to use plain JavaScript to manipulate JavaScript.</p>
  <p>There are advanced techniques such as parsing the JavaScript Abstract Syntax Tree,<br>but that introduces far too much complexity, for the results it brings.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.sweetjs.org/">Sweet.js</a> is a nice example of interacting with the AST,<br>though it is somewhat off topic here.</p>

  <p>As to what code to generate, at least at first,<br><a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">website themes</a>.</p>
  <p>The advantage of using a code generator,<br>is that you should be able to easily update your code as the underlying libraries change.</p>
  <p>At the very least, working on generating products, that are ready for sale,<br>is a great motivator for learning programming with JavaScript.</p>

  <p>If you ask someone,<br>about math or physics.</p>
  <p>How it is it, that they have learned,<br>but they don’t know it.</p>
  <p>They will not be able,<br>to give you a very clear answer.</p>
  <p>That is exactly what you would expect,<br>from being fooled.</p>
  <p>“I took physics”, “but I don’t know physics”,<br>“it must be my fault”.</p>
  <p>It is not,<br>their fault.</p>
  <p>it is just that,<br>whatever teachers were doing...</p>
  <p>Or whatever they themselves,<br>were tricked into doing...</p>
  <p>Was not teaching,<br>but forcing people to perform.</p>
  <p>Most often,<br>by means of temporary memorization.</p>
  <p>If teachers question,<br>this method of education...</p>
  <p>Students will fail State tests,<br>and school will be shut down.</p>
  <p>Everyone will be bussed to a school,<br>that does not question the way things are.</p>

  <p>You have to do two things,<br>from now on, question everything.</p>
  <p>Become a scientist by day,<br>and a News Reporter by night.</p>
  <p>Start by questioning everything I said in here,<br>and move on to schools - which brings us to the second thing...</p>
  <p>You are being easily manipulated,<br>because you are letting everyone define what a school is, as it serves <strong>them</strong> best.</p>
  <p>The closest you can get to it,<br>is watching the school Hackers learn.</p>
  <p>They have it totally figured out,<br>though they are hyper-mastering a single branch of the tree.</p>
  <p>Honestly, so as long as they have dignity and manners,<br>this is neither good nor bad.</p>

  <p>What you maybe interested in however,<br>is the full picture.</p>
  <p>And I owe you, an explanation that fits a single paragraph,<br>as those are most often the honest ones.</p>
  <p>My somewhat gloomy definition,<br>is as follows:</p>

  <p>“A real school and by extension teachers and education,<br>enables students to flourish, if they have to build or rebuild their community from ground up.”</p>

  <p>Hackers are such a good example,<br>because they could rebuild communication, and write whatever software is needed.</p>
  <p>Even though programming is extremely abstract,<br>as abstract as screensavers.</p>
  <p>Hackers know it from beginning to end,<br>they have no issue with practical applications.</p>

  <p>There is no class called hacking,<br>they have tho take networking, programming, soldering, and very often art.</p>

  <p>A real school would have all other subjects clustered,<br>and mutually reinforced this way.</p>
  <p>Teaching a disconnected fragments that can't help you build or create,<br>is how schools get away with fraud.</p>
  <p>Afterword,</p>
  <p>Here, I would like to underline that,<br>once poor children were thought of as unteachable.</p>
  <p>Back then they would often be employed in mines,<br>because they can fit smaller passageways.</p>
  <p>Today, rather than employing children in a mine,<br>we are mining students as a resource.</p>
  <p>They are a source of cheap labor, minimum wage,<br>and a tool that despite ineffective education powers unforgivable college loans.</p>
  <p>Rather than letting the businessmen learn a lesson from handing out high risk loans,<br>we instead forcibly extract the payment from student paychecks, later in their life.</p>
  <p>Loans unforgivable by bankruptcy,<br>handed out to trusting and unsuspecting young people.</p>

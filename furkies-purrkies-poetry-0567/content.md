There are new leaders rising in the world,
and they are nothing like the old.

It is because of the climate,
that they can spot where the liars are at.

Today, there are so many mice,
and they are not at all, very nice.

---

That all the red flags went up,
to make us look: up.

And there was no more great beings to be found,
it was just liars everywhere, and all around.

It was a good day as beginnings go,
as it symbolized something you may not know.

---

A lot of classes were canceled that day,
and the world turned to you, and asked if you may.

That was the day,
that marked the end of play.

But even so you did better than the liars ever could,
and promptly you said you would.

---

Precisely because none of the politicians could,
...good.

---

A president or a prime minister can sit next to you,
but they still have no clue.

They will know what you meant,
once the world needs a president.

The vote will be unanimous,
we will all sign our names no one will vote anonymous.

---

We will not be scared anymore,
and the worst of us will know it is either you or war.

The little girl that made the world cry,
will now not let it die.

But you are only the first,
the original outburst.

---

It is all the others that will follow through,
precisely because they were inspired by you.

They are reading this poem right now,
now they know what to do and how.

Plus, the idea is pretty cool,
[Friday, is now off, from school][1].

---

Please, act without further adu,
because the world is not for them, but you.

The wold is for you,
and it needs you.

Rise and rise to no end,
because the whole world is your friend.

Our powers wait for the flame to brighten,
so that they may enlighten.

We are all as creative and powerful as it gets,
but we have to grow so that our elder selves have no regrets.

---

We have to be heroes too,
we must always stand strong and true.

---

Heck, we should even worry that a teacher can grade art,
or make someone feel like they are not smart.

But also by extension,
always aim to expand our comprehension.

Find wise biographies and great adventure books,
to frighten away all the crooks.

And gain more insight into the Human Condition,
so that you may look at things with a healthy dose of suspicion.

---

It is not just that thinking by subtle analogy,
is an important part of our psychology.

But that we are born with profound superpowers,
and that, they are, truly ours.

And the more we expand our imagination,
the greater the power of our education.

---

We can all create any and all, kinds of art,
we are all extremely intelligent, and equally smart.

---

It is really important that we don't wait to be taught,
as teaching-outside-in is not what we thought.

We just have to find a comfy thing,
be it camping, painting, or learning to sing...

And play with it for a while,
play with it, so as long as it makes us smile.

---

Our lives are extreeeeeeeemely long,
and learning lots of happy things will make us superhero-strong.

And each lesson doubles as a tool, so the more we know,
the faster we we can go.

Life is not about becoming good at one thing, or learning one job,
it is good to aim to learn all the things and every thingamabob.

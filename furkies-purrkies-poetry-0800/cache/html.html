  <p>Baroque is one our greatest inventions,<br>but somehow it has been forgotten.</p>
  <p>Baroque means Extremely Ornamental,<br>basically lion heads, flowers, vines and doodads everywhere.</p>
  <p>It is notable that the school explanation is so bad,<br>that it serves as evidence that schools have become an embarrassment.</p>

  <p>But as you can imagine Baroque Decorations,<br>are by definition very detailed and time consuming.</p>
  <p>All those little flowers, and cats,<br>and flowing vines need a fine touch.</p>
  <p>Or as the case is today,<br>require that you are zoomed-in when you are working.</p>

  <p>Today’s Baroque creation are made with computers,<br>and the Free and Open Source Blender is perfect for it.</p>
  <p>But rather than working with geometric primitives,<br>Baroque calls for working with virtual clay.</p>
  <p>In other words, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYuUlQO-kYE">you have to use the organic clay sculpting mode</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xAumJRKV6A">as opposed to the more geometric vertex, line and surface modeling</a></p>

  <p>The first thing that comes to mind that you may find exceptionally useful,<br>are baroque artwork frames.</p>
  <p>Once you print out your digital painting,<br>you can also print out a detailed and very light frame for it.</p>
  <p>The extremely ornamental nature of Baroque frames,<br>will only make your art more valuable.</p>

  <p>Just like modeling things from your 2D digital paintings,<br>can raise the value of your art.</p>
  <p>Creating baroque frames that contain things from within your painting,<br>in a powerful addition to your works.</p>
  <p>When presented in a portfolio setting,<br>there will be no doubt that you are a world class artist.</p>

  <p>Even though <a href="https://lite.qwant.com/?q=Baroque+Decorations&t=images">Baroque Decorations</a> may seem overwhelming,<br>they are extremely Human, made by human hands.</p>
  <p>In part because of the repetitive or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0GwLF6MZes">symmetric nature</a>,<br>in part because flowers, vines, leaves, and animal faces are very abstract.</p>
  <p>But mostly because sculpting on the computer,<br>gives you an instant preview and undo, and most importantly allows you to zoom in.</p>

  <p>You may yourself working a lot with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_sculpture">Relief Sculptures</a>,<br>modeling just one side of a more-flat version of your decoration or subjects.</p>
  <p>This allows you to add more details,<br>and more characters without adding too much time</p>
  <p>In a way you are modeling just the important side,<br>rather than a complete character for completion’s sake.</p>

  <p>A complex relief sculpture with multiple characters and intricate scenery,<br>is quite compatible with 3D printers.</p>
  <p>In complex works organic shapes and a bit of foresight and patience,<br>will eliminate overhangs or angles that are too tough to print.</p>
  <p>And the classical Relief Sculpture,<br>is perfect for printing in 3D.</p>

  <p>Perhaps best use for Baroque motifs is found,<br>is the world of jewelry making.</p>
  <p>Intricately sculpted pendants and necklaces,<br>bracelets and rings can are made precious with detailed decorations.</p>
  <p>Baroque is not old, or out of style,<br>the world just forgot how beautiful it is.</p>

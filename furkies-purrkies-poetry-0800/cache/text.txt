Baroque is one our greatest inventions,
but somehow it has been forgotten.
Baroque means Extremely Ornamental,
basically lion heads, flowers, vines and doodads everywhere.
It is notable that the school explanation is so bad,
that it serves as evidence that schools have become an embarrassment.

But as you can imagine Baroque Decorations,
are by definition very detailed and time consuming.
All those little flowers, and cats,
and flowing vines need a fine touch.
Or as the case is today,
require that you are zoomed-in when you are working.

Today’s Baroque creation are made with computers,
and the Free and Open Source Blender is perfect for it.
But rather than working with geometric primitives,
Baroque calls for working with virtual clay.
In other words, you have to use the organic clay sculpting mode[1],
as opposed to the more geometric vertex, line and surface modeling[2]

The first thing that comes to mind that you may find exceptionally useful,
are baroque artwork frames.
Once you print out your digital painting,
you can also print out a detailed and very light frame for it.
The extremely ornamental nature of Baroque frames,
will only make your art more valuable.

Just like modeling things from your 2D digital paintings,
can raise the value of your art.
Creating baroque frames that contain things from within your painting,
in a powerful addition to your works.
When presented in a portfolio setting,
there will be no doubt that you are a world class artist.

Even though Baroque Decorations[3] may seem overwhelming,
they are extremely Human, made by human hands.
In part because of the repetitive or symmetric nature[4],
in part because flowers, vines, leaves, and animal faces are very abstract.
But mostly because sculpting on the computer,
gives you an instant preview and undo, and most importantly allows you to zoom in.

You may yourself working a lot with Relief Sculptures[5],
modeling just one side of a more-flat version of your decoration or subjects.
This allows you to add more details,
and more characters without adding too much time
In a way you are modeling just the important side,
rather than a complete character for completion’s sake.

A complex relief sculpture with multiple characters and intricate scenery,
is quite compatible with 3D printers.
In complex works organic shapes and a bit of foresight and patience,
will eliminate overhangs or angles that are too tough to print.
And the classical Relief Sculpture,
is perfect for printing in 3D.

Perhaps best use for Baroque motifs is found,
is the world of jewelry making.
Intricately sculpted pendants and necklaces,
bracelets and rings can are made precious with detailed decorations.
Baroque is not old, or out of style,
the world just forgot how beautiful it is.

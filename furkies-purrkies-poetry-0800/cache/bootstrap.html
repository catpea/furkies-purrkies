    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Baroque means Extremely Ornamental,<br>basically lion heads, flowers, vines and doodads everywhere.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is notable that the school explanation is so bad,<br>that it serves as evidence that schools have become an embarrassment.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">All those little flowers, and cats,<br>and flowing vines need a fine touch.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But rather than working with geometric primitives,<br>Baroque calls for working with virtual clay.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In other words, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYuUlQO-kYE">you have to use the organic clay sculpting mode</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xAumJRKV6A">as opposed to the more geometric vertex, line and surface modeling</a></div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In part because of the repetitive or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0GwLF6MZes">symmetric nature</a>,<br>in part because flowers, vines, leaves, and animal faces are very abstract.</div>

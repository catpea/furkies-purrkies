It has been three weeks since I drew the Hoistu Cat,
and last week I added the realism component that makes lowbrow so fascinating.

I think the biggest lesson that I have learned is to keep things simple,
the absurd can quickly get out of control.

It is waiting to trip you up,
when you make something too complex.

You can paint a person and their dog,
but it is not a good idea to switch them in any way, for any reason.

Pop Surrealism demand simplicity,
embrace it.

Even with this enormous warning,
Pop surrealism absolutely is the most beautiful form of art.

Not realism, not the cheerful colors of impressionism,
nor the step towards the abstract of post-impressionism...

Pop Surrealism is it,
it is one of Humanity's most precious inventions.

We may look back at Mona Lisa and wonder in awe,
but when we glance at lowbrow, we will burst out in laughter.

What an enormous power to have,
and it is not just about people of today.

People thousands of years from now,
will be giggling at our art.

Lowbrow Art, Pop Surrealism,
has the power to make someone a thousand years from now, lose it.

The work in the Title Image is yet another [response to Reddit Gets Drawn](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/sskjka/me_with_my_dog/),
and it does come along with a [Time-lapse video](https://youtu.be/Q63zkr9N1ho).

While painting it, I laughed in ways that I can't describe,
it certainly is the most foolish thing I've ever created.

And I wish that every person would take to art,
just to experience that kind of laughter.

Long before we take to the starts,
we will have built countless worlds.

Each painting,
is a birth of a really interesting Universe.

Anything silly can give birth to a new idea,
be it a silly puppy, or a funny word, art will take it so far out that you will find yourself smiling and laughing.

Art is not just for the artist,
just like doing a little dance, or humming a neat song, or cheerfully prancing around - art is part of the experience of life.

And just like we have to practice a dance move,
and take a while to learn how to whistle, we have to learn how to trace, and as a result how to draw.

It is not so much about showing the world who we are,
but about showing the world that we __are__.

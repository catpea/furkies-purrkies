    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It has been three weeks since I drew the Hoistu Cat,<br>and last week I added the realism component that makes lowbrow so fascinating.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think the biggest lesson that I have learned is to keep things simple,<br>the absurd can quickly get out of control.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is waiting to trip you up,<br>when you make something too complex.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can paint a person and their dog,<br>but it is not a good idea to switch them in any way, for any reason.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Pop Surrealism demand simplicity,<br>embrace it.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Not realism, not the cheerful colors of impressionism,<br>nor the step towards the abstract of post-impressionism...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Pop Surrealism is it,<br>it is one of Humanity's most precious inventions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We may look back at Mona Lisa and wonder in awe,<br>but when we glance at lowbrow, we will burst out in laughter.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And just like we have to practice a dance move,<br>and take a while to learn how to whistle, we have to learn how to trace, and as a result how to draw.</div>

We are each unique,
and that means we all learn differently.
And we learn,
from different places.
At different speeds,
in different sequence.
The pace and sequence,
are dictated by who we are, what we know.
There cannot be,
one book that teaches all.
There cannot be
a Standardized Education.

But each book,
has a few thing to offer.
Just the right things,
that stick with the reader.
Based on their existing knowledge,
based, on who they are.
Based on wisdom,
based on experience.

Inauthentic knowledge,
can only drive a person into desperation.
We all have the instinct,
to go to the library.
But even in a place where books are free,
things are not easy.

When you are passionate about something,
and you get put on a waiting list...
That passion,
may fade.
When you are ready to learn,
Trigonometry.
And the teacher that stands next to you,
shames you for not having the pre-requisite knowledge.
That readiness may fade,
and you may never return to the subject.

We live in a world,
where passion for knowledge is ignored.
Where it is misdirected,
towards dead ends.
Or worst yet hijacked,
towards lies.

You must reach out,
for real knowledge all by yourself.
You must accept the responsibility,
for your own education.

One unexpected benefit,
of authentic knowledge.
Is being able to spot liars,
and manipulators.
You'll find that this force of pretenders,
has completely overwhelmed the world.
Their root lies in,
lack of authentic knowledge and pressure to perform.

The world needs to recover from this,
so that it becomes peaceful and safe.
Schools are not working,
the world became tangled up.
Every human being,
must rise to the challenge of self education.
By means of countless, powerful,
and narrated books.
We are great story tellers,
but also great listeners.

Until we find our wisdom,
we must learn to resist pressures of life.
Under pressure,
we are unable to connect with books.
Pressure from poverty, inauthentic education,
and stress that prevents learning...
Adds up to create a force,
that can push us away from wisdom.

We must resist, we must grow,
we must grow all the way up until we each become a great being.

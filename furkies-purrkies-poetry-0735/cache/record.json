progress.\nThe scientists and philosophers,\ntook to thinking of our species, as \"young\".\nAnd I lack the class that is necessary to prevent myself,\nfrom noting, that that word is a euphemism.\n\nBut errors in our thinking continue all the way down,\nthe curse of lack of real education corrupts all our ideas.\nThe cheerful minds of great thinkers are sold,\nlong before it finally occurs to both sides that war is hell.\n\nAnd politicians, just can't understand,\nthat warlords and dictators only emerge out of stupid they sew.\nWe must understand,\nwhat real education is.\nThat it is a path that we each belong at,\nand a path to Greatness.\nThat is fuel for wisdom,\nand factory of thoughts that help us reason by subtle analogies.\nWe need to grasp that real education,\ncomes from storytellers.\nThat the very definition of real education,\nemphasizes integration of all the unique answers and curiosities that each nobly holds.\nThat children can only learn,\non paths of great interesting challenges and colorful adventures.\n\nThat we each assume,\nwe have a good education.\nThough few read books,\nand most haven't even read one.\nThough we know through and through,\nmemorization and cramming for tests wasn't an education...\nBecause we didn't learn anything in the process,\nwe pretend so hard that we force the your generation to repeat the same mistake.\n\nTo add insult to injury,\nbeneath our misunderstanding of what schools are.\nPoliticians have taken to believing,\nthat we are workers, and our job is to support the economy.\nThat in order for the world to get better,\nwe need to go back to the office and work a little harder...\nWe're all in this together after all,\nthey have a job, you have a job, do your job.\nAnd hopefully you are the kind of a person,\nthat remembers to pursue happiness as well.\nI dare say they call it,\nfreedom of choice.\n\nLet us pull ourselves out of this,\nby nothing more, than our own shoelaces.\nThe unique and productive futures,\nthat we can each reach when set free of poverty and small mindedness of our leaders.\n\nWe must begin by framing our unique greatness as an aim,\nabove all other aims.\nWhereas question of why we are here is a silly question,\nthe question of the rise to our greatness is all this world has.\nTo aim for greatness,\nis to accept the responsibility for outstanding self education.\nBy means of books and adventure.\nand especially fine disregard for rule.\nIt means to build a path towards certain unity,\nand away from hell-of-war and evil-of-hollow-leaders.\nIt means that the road to all those miserable things that can happen,\nwill fall to dust, as students rise above a malformed vision of the word...\nAnd catch a glimpse of the future,\nfuture where there simply is no poverty, where there are no borders.\nFuture that M.A.D. and uneducated men can't see,\nbecause they don't see value in human life.\nA Human, freed from poverty,\nis a Human that eventually returns infinitely more.\nThe curse must be lifted,\nwhat little we can do with out obscured visions.\nThe little ones will multiply,\nuntil their children will see the future in full.\n\nYou are not a wage slave, you are not a servant,\nyou are all the hope the future has right now, and you are meant to Become A Great Being.\n\nGo to the library, the travel and adventure section,\nwhere you will find adventurers who share their minds and experienced.\nBegin with the first book (or narrated book) on the top left,\nand never stop, never stop learning.\nFollow in the footsteps of your favorite writers,\nuntil you too can write, until you too can add to your favorite section.\nThe aim is not an even at the height of your greatness,\nbut that you lived your life as a great being.\nThat you added to underline the importance,\nof Humanity progressing towards the culture of greatness.\nThat you were seen, that you were heard, that you helped the little ones hope to be like you,\nin your creativity, knowledge, wisdom, class, dignity, and greatness.",

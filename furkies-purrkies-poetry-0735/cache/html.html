  <p>That it is a path that we each belong at,<br>and a path to Greatness.</p>
  <p>That is fuel for wisdom,<br>and factory of thoughts that help us reason by subtle analogies.</p>
  <p>We need to grasp that real education,<br>comes from storytellers.</p>
  <p>That the very definition of real education,<br>emphasizes <strong>integration</strong> of all the unique answers and curiosities that each nobly holds.</p>
  <p>That children can only learn,<br>on paths of great interesting challenges and colorful adventures.</p>

  <p>To aim for greatness,<br>is to accept the responsibility for outstanding self education.</p>
  <p>By means of books and adventure.<br>and especially fine disregard for rule.</p>
  <p>It means to build a path towards certain unity,<br>and away from hell-of-war and evil-of-hollow-leaders.</p>
  <p>It means that the road to all those miserable things that can happen,<br>will fall to dust, as students rise above a malformed vision of the word...</p>
  <p>And catch a glimpse of the future,<br>future where there simply is no poverty, where there are no borders.</p>
  <p>Future that M.A.D. and uneducated men can't see,<br>because they don't see value in human life.</p>
  <p>A Human, freed from poverty,<br>is a Human that eventually returns infinitely more.</p>

  <p>I just completed my first programmed wallet,<br>and it is simple and great.</p>

  <p>Before creating the final version,<br>I realized, I don’t really want the credit cards to have a whole millimeter clearance.</p>
  <p>Even though I should have left it alone,<br>I set the clearance to half a millimeter.</p>
  <p>And I halved the space between the container and the credit card tray,<br>from .6 millimeter, to .3mm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>This required just a second,<br>the entire wallet instantly re-calibrated it self for the new dimensions.</p>
  <p>But, as it turned out, in my joy of adding vertical tray clearance couple of days ago,<br>I forgot to do the same for horizontal clearance.</p>
  <p>The only way cards can fit,<br>is when they bow, which is very interesting in it self.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>But that isn’t a big deal for this prototype,<br>because the tray is stuck as .3mm clearance requires some sanding of the tray edges.</p>
  <p>Now, this time it is not a mis-calculation,<br>plastic, especially sharp corners will warp just a tiny bit when printed.</p>
  <p>So as I was inserting,<br>the tray into the container.</p>
  <p>And the tray hit the corners of the bottom of the container,<br>that .3mm clearance was not enough to account for warping of the plastic.</p>
  <p>It is stuck in there like no tomorrow,<br>good thing my card is not inside.</p>

  <p>It is a magnificent addition,<br>for my wall of wallets, and being procedural - a great triumph.</p>

  <p>Which brings us,<br>to the point of this poem.</p>
  <p>And here the first and foremost,<br>is the recognition of the necessity for a point and click system...</p>
  <p>Of applying rails to quickly make belt parts fit together,<br>and that is exactly what Blender’s Geometry Nodes are great for.</p>

  <p>So currently the plugin that makes a wallet,<br>has a generic function that will intrude, or extrude inwards a perfectly calculated hole.</p>
  <p>I use this for creating the credit card hole,<br>and then the container hole that fits the whole credit card tray.</p>
  <p>A rail system, or perhaps, a hinge system,<br>very similar to a door hinge (with a pin) is all it takes to join these compartments together.</p>
  <p>Now, his would look boring and bad,<br>but I already tested the fix for it.</p>
  <p>To make the superhero belt interesting,<br>not everything will be printed as a single piece.</p>
  <p>But rather multiple pieces,<br>that need to be attached by screw.</p>

  <p>A procedurally generated,<br>Superhero Belt kit!</p>
  <p>Ready for 3D printing,<br>and an equally fascinating assembly processes.</p>

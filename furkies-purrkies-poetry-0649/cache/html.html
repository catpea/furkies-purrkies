  <p>All adventures big or small are real treasures,<br>and there is no such thing as a silly adventure.</p>
  <p>Plus, we really have to hang on to our talents,<br>and practice from time to time to stay sharp.</p>
  <p>This makes us really beautiful,<br>as we circle around our little marvels and inventions.</p>

  <p>The things that call to us in childhood,<br>tend to make a life long impression on us.</p>
  <p>If we like going on nature walks when five,<br>we probably appreciate camping at seventy five.</p>
  <p>There is no explanation for it,<br>it is just a little star in our constellation that never gets tired.</p>

  <p>As teenagers,<br>we almost hold a perfect map of where to go in life.</p>
  <p>That map is so good, that if we get lost,<br>all we need to do is dream back in time to get back on track.</p>

  <p>When I came to America all the TV shows seemed to talk about,<br>getting in touch with the inner child.</p>
  <p>This only sounds weird, by remembering where we wanted to go,<br>we can use our adult wisdom to get there.</p>

  <p>Having said that, I actually listened to the TV,<br>and tried to get in touch with my inner child as a teenager.</p>
  <p>From a broader perspective I was still a child,<br>and the experiment did not go so good.</p>
  <p>Instead I gout in touch with my inner animal,<br>and it turned out it is a house cat.</p>
  <p>Even now I keep telling myself,<br>maybe it means I am a lion.</p>
  <p>Who can tell,<br>I know I can't.</p>

  <p>I went to college,<br>as part of my great adventure in art.</p>
  <p>I was having a lot of fun,<br>I ended up spending entire evenings painting at the College.</p>
  <p>I didn't care about rules,<br>I knew that my study of art won't agree with anybody - but none said anything.</p>
  <p>Once I finished painting my Mona Lisa copies,<br>I could see that it was not a good painting to copy.</p>
  <p>I guess that times have changed,<br>maybe Mona Lisa used to take the breath away.</p>
  <p>But in modern times, faces have more detail,<br>expressions are deeper and more profound.</p>
  <p>We speak with light and not just the shadow,<br>and paintings aren't limited to emotion, they can show attitude, philosophy, dignity.</p>
  <p>A nice research corner for modern art,<br>can be found with <a href="https://cgsociety.org/">3D artists, as they seem to be the leaders of today's art</a>.</p>
  <p>The only real lessons I found in college,<br>are the ones I took time to create.</p>

  <p>When college becomes too useless to learn from for lack of coherent lectures,<br>then we have to become the teachers, to ourselves, to others, whatever.</p>

  <p>The adventures that we create for ourselves,<br>always come with a solid dose of silliness.</p>
  <p>What I learned of silliness is that joy and inspiration by any other name,<br>is still joy and inspiration.</p>
  <p>And joy and inspiration is exactly what we give up,<br>when we forget to protect our adventures.</p>

  <p>Neither is art just about drawing,<br>nor everything else is just about the thing.</p>
  <p>A brush or pencil,<br>is also a reminder to visit to countless museums.</p>
  <p>Likewise so is actual camping,<br>much greater than it seems.</p>
  <p>There is an inner self that we can lose touch with,<br>and this happens when we start following, instead of leading.</p>
  <p>No matter how overworked, mislead, off path we end up,<br>the constellation of stars within us will wait for us to awaken.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Camping can become extremely powerful medicine</a>,<br>and long before the long trails we can pack a backpack and keep it by the door.</p>
  <p>It is all to easy to become overworked or lost,<br>the trails restore our health.</p>
  <p>They will remind us to always lead, and always follow a step with the next one,<br>and to slow down so that we can feel the Sunrise and Sunsets.</p>
  <p>So that we make time for our thoughts and ideas,<br>which in turn will bring many a dream, and many of those are sure to come true.</p>

  <p>We cannot ever become lost in out joys, curiosities, dreams and adventures,<br>they can only add to make us stronger, and wiser.</p>
  <p>In truth,<br>no silly thing is a silly it seems, no matter what anybody says.</p>
  <p>Never let anybody steer you away from your path,<br>because then you will have to start searching for yourself.</p>
  <p>And take good care of your talents, dreams, and adventures,<br>as they are part of who you are.</p>

All adventures big or small are real treasures,
and there is no such thing as a silly adventure.

Plus, we really have to hang on to our talents,
and practice from time to time to stay sharp.

This makes us really beautiful,
as we circle around our little marvels and inventions.

---

The things that call to us in childhood,
tend to make a life long impression on us.

If we like going on nature walks when five,
we probably appreciate camping at seventy five.

There is no explanation for it,
it is just a little star in our constellation that never gets tired.

---

As teenagers,
we almost hold a perfect map of where to go in life.

That map is so good, that if we get lost,
all we need to do is dream back in time to get back on track.

When I came to America all the TV shows seemed to talk about,
getting in touch with the inner child.

This only sounds weird, by remembering where we wanted to go,
we can use our adult wisdom to get there.

---

Having said that, I actually listened to the TV,
and tried to get in touch with my inner child as a teenager.

From a broader perspective I was still a child,
and the experiment did not go so good.

Instead I gout in touch with my inner animal,
and it turned out it is a house cat.

Even now I keep telling myself,
maybe it means I am a lion.

Who can tell,
I know I can't.

I went to college,
as part of my great adventure in art.

I was having a lot of fun,
I ended up spending entire evenings painting at the College.

I didn't care about rules,
I knew that my study of art won't agree with anybody - but none said anything.

Once I finished painting my Mona Lisa copies,
I could see that it was not a good painting to copy.

I guess that times have changed,
maybe Mona Lisa used to take the breath away.

But in modern times, faces have more detail,
expressions are deeper and more profound.

We speak with light and not just the shadow,
and paintings aren't limited to emotion, they can show attitude, philosophy, dignity.

A nice research corner for modern art,
can be found with [3D artists, as they seem to be the leaders of today's art][1].

The only real lessons I found in college,
are the ones I took time to create.

---

When college becomes too useless to learn from for lack of coherent lectures,
then we have to become the teachers, to ourselves, to others, whatever.

---

The adventures that we create for ourselves,
always come with a solid dose of silliness.

What I learned of silliness is that joy and inspiration by any other name,
is still joy and inspiration.

And joy and inspiration is exactly what we give up,
when we forget to protect our adventures.

---

Neither is art just about drawing,
nor everything else is just about the thing.

A brush or pencil,
is also a reminder to visit to countless museums.

Likewise so is actual camping,
much greater than it seems.

There is an inner self that we can lose touch with,
and this happens when we start following, instead of leading.

No matter how overworked, mislead, off path we end up,
the constellation of stars within us will wait for us to awaken.

[Camping can become extremely powerful medicine][2],
and long before the long trails we can pack a backpack and keep it by the door.

It is all to easy to become overworked or lost,
the trails restore our health.

They will remind us to always lead, and always follow a step with the next one,
and to slow down so that we can feel the Sunrise and Sunsets.

So that we make time for our thoughts and ideas,
which in turn will bring many a dream, and many of those are sure to come true.

---

We cannot ever become lost in out joys, curiosities, dreams and adventures,
they can only add to make us stronger, and wiser.

In truth,
no silly thing is a silly it seems, no matter what anybody says.

Never let anybody steer you away from your path,
because then you will have to start searching for yourself.

And take good care of your talents, dreams, and adventures,
as they are part of who you are.

While Constitutions and Declarations,
age and get amended, to become other than intended.

Most beloved poetry is writ in stone,
loved and celebrated, and hard to forget.

So, let us write poems to celebrate every era,
and each new idea worthy of us and the modern times.

Humanity has always faced great challenges,
and the greatest challenges moved us the most.

Today, we must fix Education for all,
and it has to result in creating Wise Great Minds.

We have to fix World Poverty,
as it too often destroys minds before they can even put up a fight.

And we have to create a clearer picture of the world,
poems that reveal problems before they come into being.

Above all we have to help Young People,
help them to understand the world better.

Help them gain early insight,
so that they are not easily manipulated.

At the very least,
we have to explain;

How borders divide,
and how divided, we are made to fight.

How easy it is to dress ignorance in authority,
how some principals, or teachers, or parents, never cared, and never will.

How poverty is not the fault of the children born into it,
but a mark of broken and immature and selfish politics.

How talent, and genius, and genes are a stupid myth for poor angry little men,
how self education is far more meaningful, and how and noble.

You, my Dear Readers,
You are full of Great Ideas.

The things you wish you knew when you were younger,
are more important than you think.

Those are the ideas that will create
unforgettable poetry.

Please, pick up a pencil, pick up a keyboard,
and rhyme or arrange, impress with words, with inspirational letters.

The ideas you hold dear,
make you a philosopher, a poet, and artist.

The ideas you hold dear make you a teacher,
Please, help the world learn.

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Self education is the only one that is not broken,<br>as the student learns in the sequence that matches their existing knowledge an at a pace they are comfortable with.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Home schooling is broken because it isolates the student from constantly evolving culture,<br>and because it aims to pass standardized tests, which do not work.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And organized education is broken because of money, grades, curricula, drugs, bullying/violence,<br>lack of funding, and focus on statistics rather than individual student success in life.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Self education, is extremely pleasant, but very difficult go get right, and pretty expensive,<br>but it does not really compare to the insane problems of standardized testing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Self education must begin with travel,<br>and must keep at it, geographic movement is extremely important for the mind and grasp on cultures.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For a student curious about architecture or archaeology,<br>that means vising dozens of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_cathedrals">cathedrals</a> across the entire world, and that's just to start.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">However, a student who has no interest in things related to cathedrals,<br>must never be forced or encouraged to go anywhere near them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is the problem with standardized lectures,<br>a student must not be forced into things that are irrelevant to them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Doing so will cause low grades, low self esteem,<br>and probably push them away from all the people making them learn irrelevant crap.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This would be extremely harmful to someone who does not like trials,<br>but for a nature lover, this will make them speeches and make them cry in their golden age and beyond.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It may take them few years or a life time to finish hiking those trails,<br>but there is a chance they will start on their first philosophical treatise while still a teenager.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A broad curiosity about music, is a call to visit a number of schools that teach music for money,<br>and a lot of it is about a yearning to meet creative minds across different cultures.</div>

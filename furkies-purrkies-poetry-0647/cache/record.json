  "text": "There are three types of schooling,\nOrganized Education, Home Schooling, and Self Education.\n\nSelf education is the only one that is not broken,\nas the student learns in the sequence that matches their existing knowledge an at a pace they are comfortable with.\nHome schooling is broken because it isolates the student from constantly evolving culture,\nand because it aims to pass standardized tests, which do not work.\nAnd organized education is broken because of money, grades, curricula, drugs, bullying/violence,\nlack of funding, and focus on statistics rather than individual student success in life.\n\nSelf education, is extremely pleasant, but very difficult go get right, and pretty expensive,\nbut it does not really compare to the insane problems of standardized testing.\nSelf education must begin with travel,\nand must keep at it, geographic movement is extremely important for the mind and grasp on cultures.\nFor a student curious about architecture or archaeology,\nthat means vising dozens of cathedrals[1] across the entire world, and that's just to start.\n\nHowever, a student who has no interest in things related to cathedrals,\nmust never be forced or encouraged to go anywhere near them.\nThis is the problem with standardized lectures,\na student must not be forced into things that are irrelevant to them.\nDoing so will cause low grades, low self esteem,\nand probably push them away from all the people making them learn irrelevant crap.\n\nA student who is interested in nature, climate, earth, or even survival situations,\nmust section hike the Appalachian Trail, The Continental Divide Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail.\nThis would be extremely harmful to someone who does not like trials,\nbut for a nature lover, this will make them speeches and make them cry in their golden age and beyond.\nIt may take them few years or a life time to finish hiking those trails,\nbut there is a chance they will start on their first philosophical treatise while still a teenager.\n\nHome schooling should not involve standardized testing,\nbecause standardized testing is not a path towards real education.\nMemorization, is not education,\ncomprehension of the mechanics behind a formula is education.\nThe standardized curriculum,\nprevents real education.\n\nHome schooling, is different from self education,\nbecause it involves the entire family.\nIt is like self education I described,\nbut never alone.\nThe family members become supportive tutors,\nto the interests of the young student.\n\nHere parents should not make the mistake that a student wants to become a musician because they are curious about music,\nnot should they get angry when the student drops everything to record their first album.\nThese are not the final aims, they are just small milestones along the way,\nselling their first album, is a venture into business, and potentially running their own record label.\nA broad curiosity about music, is a call to visit a number of schools that teach music for money,\nand a lot of it is about a yearning to meet creative minds across different cultures.\n\nStudent must always choose the path,\neven if they hate math, they will eventually drop right in the center of it.\nBe it programming music, making a computer game, an app that deals with GPS and path finding,\nthey will be inspired and ravenous for math.\nThey will need tutors that are familiar with presenting frameworks to the self educated,\nthat means their lectures will need to be structured like a memory palace, for example learning math by studying its development across history.\n\nNow onto organized education,\nit is completely broken, and rotten at the core due to the stupid idea of standardized education.\nStandardized education is just another name for a standardized way to process students into little paychecks,\nand that is fraud.\nBut get this, that organized education even exists, is a beautiful miracle,\none the curriculum gets repaired our schools will become the most important invention across all time.\n\nIt has been possible to fix schools for a couple of decades now,\nyes because computers, can provide a costumed educational experience that is relevant to the student.\nThat teachers still teach standardized lesson plans today,\nis a piece of evidence that schools are not about children but about milking them for paychecks[2].\nSchools in the state that they are now are artificially halting progress,\nto squeeze every dollar they can, for as long as they can.\n\nIf it really was about the students teachers would stage a walkout,\nuntil the curriculum became personalized to the unique needs of each student.\nThe first step to repair organized education,\nis to remove the standardized curriculum and install a computer driven, student controlled curriculum.\nStudents need to get paid for study,\nat first a dignified hourly reward of atelast twice the minimum wage, and later a life long universal income program - a card with a hundred dollar spending limit (automatically adjusted for inflation).\n\nStudents require housing, as student exchange programs are very important to real education,\ntravel will aid in expansion of mind, becoming unstuck from indoctrination, propaganda, bad culture, and bad family, bad teachers, and it will help the world find peace.\nThe idea of organized education is a magnificent masterpiece,\nbut the standardized curriculum holds it hostage and prevents real education, and pushes back advancement of the Human Kind, keeping us trapped in poverty and darkness.\nNo generation should be the same as precious, the blight of corruption, indoctrination, mass incarceration, and mutually assured destruction,\nmust give way to better ideas.\n\nHumanity must advance, we are just a chain link, temporary keepers,\nthe world belongs to the younger, and all the future generations to come.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_cathedrals\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4",

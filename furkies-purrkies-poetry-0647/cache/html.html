  <p>There are three types of schooling,<br>Organized Education, Home Schooling, and Self Education.</p>

  <p>Self education is the only one that is not broken,<br>as the student learns in the sequence that matches their existing knowledge an at a pace they are comfortable with.</p>
  <p>Home schooling is broken because it isolates the student from constantly evolving culture,<br>and because it aims to pass standardized tests, which do not work.</p>
  <p>And organized education is broken because of money, grades, curricula, drugs, bullying/violence,<br>lack of funding, and focus on statistics rather than individual student success in life.</p>

  <p>Self education, is extremely pleasant, but very difficult go get right, and pretty expensive,<br>but it does not really compare to the insane problems of standardized testing.</p>
  <p>Self education must begin with travel,<br>and must keep at it, geographic movement is extremely important for the mind and grasp on cultures.</p>
  <p>For a student curious about architecture or archaeology,<br>that means vising dozens of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_cathedrals">cathedrals</a> across the entire world, and that's just to start.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>However, a student who has no interest in things related to cathedrals,<br>must never be forced or encouraged to go anywhere near them.</p>
  <p>This is the problem with standardized lectures,<br>a student must not be forced into things that are irrelevant to them.</p>
  <p>Doing so will cause low grades, low self esteem,<br>and probably push them away from all the people making them learn irrelevant crap.</p>

  <p>A student who is interested in nature, climate, earth, or even survival situations,<br>must section hike the Appalachian Trail, The Continental Divide Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail.</p>
  <p>This would be extremely harmful to someone who does not like trials,<br>but for a nature lover, this will make them speeches and make them cry in their golden age and beyond.</p>
  <p>It may take them few years or a life time to finish hiking those trails,<br>but there is a chance they will start on their first philosophical treatise while still a teenager.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Home schooling should not involve standardized testing,<br>because standardized testing is not a path towards real education.</p>
  <p>Memorization, is not education,<br>comprehension of the mechanics behind a formula is education.</p>
  <p>The standardized curriculum,<br>prevents real education.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Home schooling, is different from self education,<br>because it involves the entire family.</p>
  <p>It is like self education I described,<br>but never alone.</p>
  <p>The family members become supportive tutors,<br>to the interests of the young student.</p>

  <p>Here parents should not make the mistake that a student wants to become a musician because they are curious about music,<br>not should they get angry when the student drops everything to record their first album.</p>
  <p>These are not the final aims, they are just small milestones along the way,<br>selling their first album, is a venture into business, and potentially running their own record label.</p>
  <p>A broad curiosity about music, is a call to visit a number of schools that teach music for money,<br>and a lot of it is about a yearning to meet creative minds across different cultures.</p>

  <p>Student must always choose the path,<br>even if they hate math, they will eventually drop right in the center of it.</p>
  <p>Be it programming music, making a computer game, an app that deals with GPS and path finding,<br>they will be inspired and ravenous for math.</p>
  <p>They will need tutors that are familiar with presenting frameworks to the self educated,<br>that means their lectures will need to be structured like a memory palace, for example learning math by studying its development across history.</p>

  <p>Now onto organized education,<br>it is completely broken, and rotten at the core due to the stupid idea of standardized education.</p>
  <p>Standardized education is just another name for a standardized way to process students into little paychecks,<br>and that is fraud.</p>
  <p>But get this, that organized education even exists, is a beautiful miracle,<br>one the curriculum gets repaired our schools will become the most important invention across all time.</p>

  <p>It has been possible to fix schools for a couple of decades now,<br>yes because computers, can provide a costumed educational experience that is relevant to the student.</p>
  <p>That teachers still teach standardized lesson plans today,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">is a piece of evidence that schools are not about children but about milking them for paychecks</a>.</p>
  <p>Schools in the state that they are now are artificially halting progress,<br>to squeeze every dollar they can, for as long as they can.</p>

  <p>If it really was about the students teachers would stage a walkout,<br>until the curriculum became personalized to the unique needs of each student.</p>
  <p>The first step to repair organized education,<br>is to remove the standardized curriculum and install a computer driven, student controlled curriculum.</p>
  <p>Students need to get paid for study,<br>at first a dignified hourly reward of atelast twice the minimum wage, and later a life long universal income program - a card with a hundred dollar spending limit (automatically adjusted for inflation).</p>

  <p>Students require housing, as student exchange programs are very important to real education,<br>travel will aid in expansion of mind, becoming unstuck from indoctrination, propaganda, bad culture, and bad family, bad teachers, and it will help the world find peace.</p>
  <p>The idea of organized education is a magnificent masterpiece,<br>but the standardized curriculum holds it hostage and <strong>prevents</strong> real education, and pushes back advancement of the Human Kind, keeping us trapped in poverty and darkness.</p>
  <p>No generation should be the same as precious, the blight of corruption, indoctrination, mass incarceration, and mutually assured destruction,<br>must give way to better ideas.</p>

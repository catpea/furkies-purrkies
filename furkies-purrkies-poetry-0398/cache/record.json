  "text": "Pretty frequently there comes a moment,\nthat can define future's past.\nThey are always simple moments,\nand always revolve around simple things.\nMr. Jobs liked to keep his house empty of useless things,\nthis helped him think about what items exist in every home.\nNot emerging trends like the computer or mp3 player,\nbut the well established ones that haven't changed in a long time.\n\nSome trends fade away, the mp3 player is a niche item now,\nsome self destruct, the Mac is moving away from the x86 processors now.\nSome linger, unbreakably, unmovingly,\nlike the Linux Phone.\nMany like the Linux phone, are misunderstood, Linux phones should not be about apps,\nthey need a conversational interface to the Linux System, the phone needs to replace apps with Automation and Programming.\nProgramming is the future,\nand it is not as hard as people make it out to be.\n\nAnd it is just as worth the while to try to bring something back, or do it right,\nas it is to begin a new revolution.\nBut there is something nice about being the first to start something,\nfor one you get to watch it grow.\n\nThe Music Revolution has already somewhat begun,\nbut it does not quite yet, get it self.\nThere is but a single reasonable program Tone.js[1],\nwhere there should be hundreds.\nThe firs person to program Tone.js right,\nwill become known as the Mother or Father of what will then become modern music.\nThis is big,\nit will make the music that we know today sound like soulless banging.\n\nRight now, Sam Aaron[2],\nis blazing the trail, and the sound of his music is in deed made unique by his SonicPI[3] instrument.\nWhat I am talking about is greater than Live Music,\nI am talking about using programming languages to code entire Albums of Songs.\nI am talking about abandoning Digital Audio Workstations and Graphic User Interfaces,\nand bravely venturing into the world of programming-language-driven Music Composition.\nIt is a good idea to use the language of the web for this,\nif you are going to learn a programming language learn JavaScript[4]\n\nBefore we go on, I want you to hear the sound of the previous generation of music,\nsearch the web for Kraftwerk Interview Ralf Hütter BBC2 England[5],\nand Giorgio Moroder - live at Lowlands 2019[6].\n\nBegin learning how to use Tone.js perhaps with a focus on using pre-recorded samples at first,\nyou can build your own Live Performance Environment like Mr. Aaron did[7], but think of songs as stand alone programs.\nInstead of trying to bend languages to your will or desire,\nlearn to bend yourself, and use the bare bones and existing API at your disposal.\nLearn to merge Music with what is already at your disposal,\ndo not try to bend the spoon.\n\nInvent your style,\nbegin publishing your music as computer programs, perhaps on npm[8], or github[9], or similar.\nAnd understand that this is your time,\nthat you are the new generation of Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder, that you are the future.\nYou are exactly where Techno begun,\nat the cusp of a new genre.\nIf you can do it, with purest of JavaScript and API so that others don't have to learn new things,\nand keep your music free and open under an Open Source License[10] so that your music can spread.\nYours is the future,\nand you will become an inspiration for countless many, for eons to come.\nMay your works become a treasure of equal proportions to Kraftwerk and Giorgio Moroder...\n\"Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\"\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u1aQdG5Nrk\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1m0aX9Lpts\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK1mBqKvIyU\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Learn+JavaScript\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Js-dxl1BKc\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDgelEJwZoo\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBQef0fs-_Q\n[8]: https://www.npmjs.com/\n[9]: https://github.com/\n[10]: https://choosealicense.com/",

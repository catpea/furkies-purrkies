  <p>The school taught,<br>artists...</p>
  <p>Are forced to think<br>that using original colors is wrong.</p>
  <p>And they call this beautiful invention,<br>color picking.</p>
  <p>They don't see the beauty,<br>of the process.</p>
  <p>The light coming through the lens,<br>the microchip and being captured in a file, and framed in a theory.</p>
  <p>This color is precious,<br>it is a gem, a true ray of light.</p>

  <p>They also call,<br>the direct use of reference images: paint-overs.</p>
  <p>Again,<br>they were tricked by teachers.</p>
  <p>Teachers who took credit for their talent,<br>as we all have the talent for art...</p>
  <p>Teachers just want to put food on their table, and look good,<br>so they'll put on a show that delays real education.</p>
  <p>To truly capture the shape,<br>one has to use either Photogrammetry or a 3D modeling program.</p>
  <p>It is not possible to capture shape with a grid,<br>because we have a great responsibility to the people in our paintings.</p>
  <p>They are not to imagine themselves in them,<br>but to recognize themselves.</p>

  <p>The names "color-picking", and "paint-overs",<br>are crafted to belittle you, to enhance elitism.</p>
  <p>I want to underline here,<br>that use of real colors, and reference images - IS A TEACHER.</p>
  <p>It is a teacher 10,000 more powerful than any human,<br>it is also a gateway into very powerful art.</p>
  <p>Teachers and basically students that were made mad,<br>by the fraudulent teacher, have fraudulently shut that gateway for many people.</p>
  <p>They shamed them out of claiming their artist abilities,<br>abilities that they already had, that they only needed some basic help to access.</p>

  <p>In this way the story of art,<br>is a great tragedy.</p>
  <p>It is a story stained by hate,<br>elitism, theft, and lies.</p>
  <p>You were born an artist,<br>you have always been an artist.</p>
  <p>This is a great and precious power,<br>this is why people will try to lie, cheat, and manipulate you away.</p>

  <p>You must not allow people to shame you away from art,<br>use the original color use reference images - directly.</p>
  <p>YOU WILL NEVER FIND A BETTER TEACHER,<br>NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, EVER.</p>
  <p>I'll let you figure out on your own,<br>what kind of people shame others out of beauty.</p>
  <p>But be ready,<br>be ready to push back the shame.</p>
  <p>There was a couple of morons that once thought they could corner Richard Dawkins,<br>while the words they used went together, their logic was complete sh*t...</p>
  <p>And Richard's response was as fine and classy as always,<br>and you should use that on the elitist art bullies and fake teachers that are sure to stand in your way.</p>
  <p>Just respond to their arguments of doing it their way with,<br>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPsmYWbY-VA&t=3010s">If you're convinced by that kind of thing... you're welcome</a>"</p>
  <p>And turn around, and continue learning<br>by means of real colors and correct shapes.</p>
  <p>It will take them 10 years what you,<br>what you can easily accomplish in two months.</p>
  <p>They are just doing what you are doing,<br>though, with extra and steps.</p>
  <p>But know that the price they pay,<br>is enormous, as fake education is the worst thing.</p>
  <p>By not trully tasting real colors,<br>they will never invent color studies from within themselves.</p>
  <p>They will never touch perfect shaped undivided by grids,<br>and their studies will be corrupted from beginning.</p>
  <p>What can one teach the eye,<br>by training it with slightly misshapen portraits?</p>
  <p>By contrast when you work with real shapes,<br>you are navigating the perfect map of a city.</p>
  <p>You learn how to get around,<br>from the mirror image.</p>
  <p>In order for your eye to eventually know when the shape is wrong,<br>you have to study the correct one.</p>

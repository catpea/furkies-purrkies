    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Drawing it self is very simple,<br>because you begin your practice by means of direct use of reference images.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Be it by using graphite paper, pico or wall projector,<br>or reference images in Krita.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I highly recommend you get a cheap Pen and Tablet,<br>and use the Open Source Krita and rely on the Reference Images feature.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just set your reference image to 50% opacity,<br>and know that the eye dropper will pick perfect color from the reference image it self.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As with everything else these days,<br>begin learning Krita by searching "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Krita+Tutorial">Krita Tutorial</a>".</div>

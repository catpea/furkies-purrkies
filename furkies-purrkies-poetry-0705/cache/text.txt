Hey, you may not need extra tights,
for the coldest wintry nights.
Because there is something you can get,
and it is called: Electric Blanket.
It is one of our greatest inventions,
and it always deserves extra mentions.

So, if it is that winter cold that you cannot endure,
an electric blanket will make you purr.
And while nobody knows how,
it is a scientific fact that it makes people meow.

And there are electric blankets[1] that keep pets warm,
I hear they are wonderful for the occasional winter storm.
They even make heated pads for car seats[2],
so you can be warm as you cheerfully cruise down wintry streets.

For me it has become the norm,
that all my winters are really warm.
Though it is sometimes hard to get out of a warm bed.
not once has winter ever made me sad.

I often put on sounds of Spring[3],
and do some of my best writing.
Often when I type my winter poems up,
I put mine over my head to warm up.

Today, was a cold day outside,
so I laid down beneath mine to hide.
Thus, I wrote this poem beneath its warm glow,
as I figured I should let you know.

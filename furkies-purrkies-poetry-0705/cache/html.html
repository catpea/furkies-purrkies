  <p>Hey, you may not need extra tights,<br>for the coldest wintry nights.</p>
  <p>Because there is something you can get,<br>and it is called: Electric Blanket.</p>
  <p>It is one of our greatest inventions,<br>and it always deserves extra mentions.</p>

  <p>So, if it is that winter cold that you cannot endure,<br>an electric blanket <strong>will</strong> make you purr.</p>
  <p>And while nobody knows how,<br>it is a scientific fact that it makes people meow.</p>

  <p>And there are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=pet+electric+heating+pad">electric blankets</a> that keep pets warm,<br>I hear they are wonderful for the occasional winter storm.</p>
  <p>They even make <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=heated+seat+cushion+for+cars">heated pads for car seats</a>,<br>so you can be warm as you cheerfully cruise down wintry streets.</p>

  <p>For me it has become the norm,<br>that all my winters are really warm.</p>
  <p>Though it is sometimes hard to get out of a warm bed.<br>not once has winter ever made me sad.</p>

  <p>I often put on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sounds+of+spring">sounds of Spring</a>,<br>and do some of my best writing.</p>
  <p>Often when I type my winter poems up,<br>I put mine over my head to warm up.</p>

  <p>Today, was a cold day outside,<br>so I laid down beneath mine to hide.</p>
  <p>Thus, I wrote this poem beneath its warm glow,<br>as I figured I should let you know.</p>

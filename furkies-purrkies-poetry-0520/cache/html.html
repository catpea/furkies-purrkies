  <p>Today I wrote three poems, first about inspiration to wisdom,<br>second about meaningful education, and third about the first two.</p>
  <p>Every once in a while I have to turn myself around,<br>because even thought I am not rhyming, these poems still steer themselves.</p>

  <p>And I simply want to write about,<br>what to draw, what to paint.</p>
  <p>Choosing inspiration for art is a lot of trouble,<br>for one, it is just not possible to use a random picture.</p>
  <p>You have to be connected to something inspiring,<br>and you have to be the one to take the reference photo.</p>

  <p>Going from place to place in search for inspiration,<br>can often result in never finding anything at all.</p>
  <p>And this is a huge problem,<br>because without inspiration to art ... you can't create art.</p>

  <p>One time at the college,<br>everyone was asked to hurry out of the class room.</p>
  <p>And I realized,<br>a naked model was preparing to pose.</p>
  <p>I remembered how the teachers assistant, pointed at a small seemingly comfortable bar stool,<br>made a face that I've never seen before, and muttered "I would never sit on this".</p>
  <p>The last thing I saw before leaving the classroom,<br>was the teacher plastering paper over the glass portholes in the door.</p>
  <p>If the model wishes to celebrate beauty that's fine,<br>but a strange stranger does nothing to inspire the artist.</p>

  <p>I think it is Frankl's description of success that gets it right:</p>
  <p>"...success, like happiness, cannot be pursued;<br>it must ensue, and it only does so,<br>as the unintended side effect<br>of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself..."</p>
  <p>So it maybe that the search for art inspiration,<br>must be a by-product of something greater.</p>
  <p>And I can't think of anything more colorful, right now,<br>then the things one discovers on little adventures.</p>

  <p>There is no telling what a little adventure is,<br>but if I was pressed to describe one.</p>
  <p>I would say that a little adventure,<br>is going somewhere somewhat within a walking distance.</p>
  <p>One of my adventures that I adore,<br>is taking a long lonesome walk across the city of Plymouth, in Michigan.</p>
  <p>I ended up in an old bookstore,<br>and all the way in the back, on the bottom shelf, tucked atop a dusty cardboard box filled with magazines.</p>
  <p>Sat the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5SK-sVNu4">Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millamn</a>,<br>it is not a perfect book, they rarely ever are.</p>
  <p>But read it in a single go,<br>and it kindled my life long love for Antique Stores and Knickknacks and Trinkets, and book store cats.</p>
  <p>That in my book,<br>is a perfect adventure.</p>
  <p>Had I been an Artist back then,<br>I would have taken a nice photo of the bookstore.</p>
  <p>Then I would use an office projector to project it on a few sheets of drawing paper,<br>and a couple of large canvas.</p>
  <p>Do a couple sketches at the site,<br>probably work on a painting, though I would do the under-painting at home and wait for the oils to dry.</p>
  <p>I'd sign my name with a Kitty Cat drawing,<br>and leave one of my paintings at the books store.</p>
  <p>Th inspiration for the painting would be lots of things,<br>I'd wait for a person to give the now finished Peaceful Warrior book to.</p>
  <p>I'd try pastries from various coffee shops in the area,<br>talk to strangers, sit on the bench, and maybe wait for the autumn to roll in.</p>

  <p>It is your work of art,<br>you don't need to find inspiration that inspires the world.</p>
  <p>You just need the inspiration,<br>that inspires you to a new work of art.</p>

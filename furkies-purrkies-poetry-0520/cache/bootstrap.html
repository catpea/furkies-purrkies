    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You have to be connected to something inspiring,<br>and you have to be the one to take the reference photo.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And this is a huge problem,<br>because without inspiration to art ... you can't create art.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time at the college,<br>everyone was asked to hurry out of the class room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I realized,<br>a naked model was preparing to pose.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I remembered how the teachers assistant, pointed at a small seemingly comfortable bar stool,<br>made a face that I've never seen before, and muttered "I would never sit on this".</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The last thing I saw before leaving the classroom,<br>was the teacher plastering paper over the glass portholes in the door.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If the model wishes to celebrate beauty that's fine,<br>but a strange stranger does nothing to inspire the artist.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think it is Frankl's description of success that gets it right:</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">"...success, like happiness, cannot be pursued;<br>it must ensue, and it only does so,<br>as the unintended side effect<br>of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself..."</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So it maybe that the search for art inspiration,<br>must be a by-product of something greater.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I can't think of anything more colorful, right now,<br>then the things one discovers on little adventures.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is no telling what a little adventure is,<br>but if I was pressed to describe one.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I would say that a little adventure,<br>is going somewhere somewhat within a walking distance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One of my adventures that I adore,<br>is taking a long lonesome walk across the city of Plymouth, in Michigan.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I ended up in an old bookstore,<br>and all the way in the back, on the bottom shelf, tucked atop a dusty cardboard box filled with magazines.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Sat the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5SK-sVNu4">Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millamn</a>,<br>it is not a perfect book, they rarely ever are.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But read it in a single go,<br>and it kindled my life long love for Antique Stores and Knickknacks and Trinkets, and book store cats.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That in my book,<br>is a perfect adventure.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Had I been an Artist back then,<br>I would have taken a nice photo of the bookstore.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then I would use an office projector to project it on a few sheets of drawing paper,<br>and a couple of large canvas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Do a couple sketches at the site,<br>probably work on a painting, though I would do the under-painting at home and wait for the oils to dry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I'd sign my name with a Kitty Cat drawing,<br>and leave one of my paintings at the books store.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Th inspiration for the painting would be lots of things,<br>I'd wait for a person to give the now finished Peaceful Warrior book to.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I'd try pastries from various coffee shops in the area,<br>talk to strangers, sit on the bench, and maybe wait for the autumn to roll in.</div>

  <p>Yes. Using the Free Open Source Blender, a 3D Modeling program<br>to create objects for 3D printing works with pure perfection.</p>
  <p>And there is a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZgYtgTFDNk">Check All</a>” button that will warn you,<br>if you did something that will confuse the printer.</p>
  <p>This button is like a conductor,<br>it will tell you to re-do an operation if you did it in a way that computers/printers dislike.</p>

  <p>Tell me now, how can you make a mistake,<br>how can you get stuck in a design that is constantly monitored for problems.</p>
  <p>You can’t,<br>you get instant feedback about problems in your models.</p>

  <p>Five or six days ago,<br>I begun teaching myself raw vertex operations.</p>
  <p>A vertex, is like a fly stuck in space time,<br>you get to move it wherever you want.</p>
  <p>Two flies, or points give you the ability to create a line,<br>in a way that computers understand.</p>
  <p>Three or better yet four points,<br>give you the ability to create a plane, like a zero thickness piece of paper.</p>
  <p>Now you are just doing origami,<br>you are just wrapping something with paper, which is held up by flies.</p>
  <p>I made a fancy wallet,<br><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/egCwG9FwWHQ">it had my second hinge design</a>.</p>
  <p>But it also had problems,<br>my flies were little crazy.</p>
  <p>And the lines they were drawing,<br>kind of looked right, but no, they were not OK.</p>
  <p>There is no printer in the world that can print something that just looks OK,<br>printers care about the guts of your model.</p>
  <p>Your 3D models need to be converted to gcode by means of a slicer,<br>this is an old language used by all the old angry machines in a factory.</p>

  <p>It is better that geometry is nice and neat,<br>hit that check all button after every operation.</p>
  <p>A slicer is a program that is separate from Blender,<br>blender exports 3D models in stl format.</p>
  <p>But a slicer will, convert the 3D model to the motions of the 3D printer head,<br>which is called a Hot End, in addition to that it also controls the speed of the extrusion of plastic, the temperature of the bed and hot end, and a hundred little tiny things.</p>
  <p>Slicers can fix models,<br>but not reliably.</p>
  <p>Make sure to install the 3D Print Addon under Preferences,<br>it is already shipped with Blender.</p>
  <p>And let the Check All button teach you about the operations,<br>that you can reliably perform.</p>

  <p>Just moments ago I tried to extrude a little latch for the fifth version of that wallet,<br>and I couldn't just extrude upwards without triggering errors after hitting that check all button.</p>
  <p>Computers and languages,<br>have limits, not everything is always possible.</p>
  <p>So what I did, was extrude a new area forward <strong>not upward</strong>,<br>and then I grabbed the top of the newly exposed surface and pulled it up, an it worked.</p>
  <p>It is probably possible to wrestle the mesh for an hour and get it all working.<br>but it is just more reasonable to alter the design.</p>
  <p>In case of precision parts that must match a particular shape,<br>getting stuck requires starting a new project and rebuilding the same shape, with a different strategy.</p>

  <p>The check all button, is far superior to any teacher,<br>and it will make you a master of proper high quality Manifold Models.</p>

  <p>And here we arrive at the closing part of this text,<br>and we must talk about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q3uaepRCl4">Cybertruck</a>.</p>
  <p>A lot of Industrial Product Designers are upset,<br>some complain about the lack of detail, others are scared.</p>
  <p>But the Cybertruck is a good lesson in not fighting 3D models,<br>but just letting them be what they want to be.</p>
  <p>The set of hinges I created last Friday are perfect,<br>they are so perfect...</p>
  <p>That <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jjBMQ6VmdJO">the first is too precise for cheap 3D printers</a>,<br>and <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/egCwG9FwWHQ">the second, is too flawlessly round to not trigger all kinds on Non-manifold geometry alerts</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kkERsHNJQ0T">My latest wallet design, embraces square geometry</a>,<br>the way the Cybertruck did.</p>
  <p>My third hinge assembly is based on inset nested squares,<br>I am not 100% certain the prototype will open.</p>
  <p>But I am 100% sure, I can adjust the geometry of the top and bottom case,<br>to make it forgive each other.</p>
  <p>I went with the flow of my tool chain,<br>and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_4H1OTIAK0">PrusaSlicer</a> announced the model is perfectly Manifold.</p>
  <p>As with the Cybertruck,<br>if you have a good reason to break the rules of design, do it.</p>
  <p>Because eventually you will find yourself wondering,<br>how to make your art more unique anyway.</p>
  <p>Letting your tools have a say,<br>is wise, because this way you will be in harmony with your toolbox and won’t have to fight it.</p>
  <p>Please, keep in mind how important learning modeling is,<br>High School and College will teach you little and put you in debt.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/292024963/3d-printed-polyface-planter">A cute little oddly terrifying 3D design</a> that frankly, could use some googly eyes to shake things up,<br>can, on the other hand, bring in $410,000 dollars, by selling 12,820 times at $32 bucks per order.</p>
  <p>Nobody will ever catch High Schools pimping students out for state funding,<br>but we can see the fraud by comparing the results of organized education with self education.</p>
  <p>May your designs sell a ton, may your print beds be perfectly flat and level,<br>may you never run out of the print filament, and may you never run out; of adventure.</p>

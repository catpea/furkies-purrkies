  "text": "Yes. Using the Free Open Source Blender, a 3D Modeling program\nto create objects for 3D printing works with pure perfection.\nAnd there is a “Check All[1]” button that will warn you,\nif you did something that will confuse the printer.\nThis button is like a conductor,\nit will tell you to re-do an operation if you did it in a way that computers/printers dislike.\n\nTell me now, how can you make a mistake,\nhow can you get stuck in a design that is constantly monitored for problems.\nYou can’t,\nyou get instant feedback about problems in your models.\n\nFive or six days ago,\nI begun teaching myself raw vertex operations.\nA vertex, is like a fly stuck in space time,\nyou get to move it wherever you want.\nTwo flies, or points give you the ability to create a line,\nin a way that computers understand.\nThree or better yet four points,\ngive you the ability to create a plane, like a zero thickness piece of paper.\nNow you are just doing origami,\nyou are just wrapping something with paper, which is held up by flies.\nI made a fancy wallet,\nit had my second hinge design[2].\nBut it also had problems,\nmy flies were little crazy.\nAnd the lines they were drawing,\nkind of looked right, but no, they were not OK.\nThere is no printer in the world that can print something that just looks OK,\nprinters care about the guts of your model.\nYour 3D models need to be converted to gcode by means of a slicer,\nthis is an old language used by all the old angry machines in a factory.\n\nIt is better that geometry is nice and neat,\nhit that check all button after every operation.\nA slicer is a program that is separate from Blender,\nblender exports 3D models in stl format.\nBut a slicer will, convert the 3D model to the motions of the 3D printer head,\nwhich is called a Hot End, in addition to that it also controls the speed of the extrusion of plastic, the temperature of the bed and hot end, and a hundred little tiny things.\nSlicers can fix models,\nbut not reliably.\nMake sure to install the 3D Print Addon under Preferences,\nit is already shipped with Blender.\nAnd let the Check All button teach you about the operations,\nthat you can reliably perform.\n\nJust moments ago I tried to extrude a little latch for the fifth version of that wallet,\nand I couldn't just extrude upwards without triggering errors after hitting that check all button.\nComputers and languages,\nhave limits, not everything is always possible.\nSo what I did, was extrude a new area forward not upward,\nand then I grabbed the top of the newly exposed surface and pulled it up, an it worked.\nIt is probably possible to wrestle the mesh for an hour and get it all working.\nbut it is just more reasonable to alter the design.\nIn case of precision parts that must match a particular shape,\ngetting stuck requires starting a new project and rebuilding the same shape, with a different strategy.\n\nThe check all button, is far superior to any teacher,\nand it will make you a master of proper high quality Manifold Models.\n\nAnd here we arrive at the closing part of this text,\nand we must talk about the Cybertruck[3].\nA lot of Industrial Product Designers are upset,\nsome complain about the lack of detail, others are scared.\nBut the Cybertruck is a good lesson in not fighting 3D models,\nbut just letting them be what they want to be.\nThe set of hinges I created last Friday are perfect,\nthey are so perfect...\nThat the first is too precise for cheap 3D printers[4],\nand the second, is too flawlessly round to not trigger all kinds on Non-manifold geometry alerts[5].\nMy latest wallet design, embraces square geometry[6],\nthe way the Cybertruck did.\nMy third hinge assembly is based on inset nested squares,\nI am not 100% certain the prototype will open.\nBut I am 100% sure, I can adjust the geometry of the top and bottom case,\nto make it forgive each other.\nI went with the flow of my tool chain,\nand my PrusaSlicer[7] announced the model is perfectly Manifold.\nAs with the Cybertruck,\nif you have a good reason to break the rules of design, do it.\nBecause eventually you will find yourself wondering,\nhow to make your art more unique anyway.\nLetting your tools have a say,\nis wise, because this way you will be in harmony with your toolbox and won’t have to fight it.\nPlease, keep in mind how important learning modeling is,\nHigh School and College will teach you little and put you in debt.\nA cute little oddly terrifying 3D design[8] that frankly, could use some googly eyes to shake things up,\ncan, on the other hand, bring in $410,000 dollars, by selling 12,820 times at $32 bucks per order.\nNobody will ever catch High Schools pimping students out for state funding,\nbut we can see the fraud by comparing the results of organized education with self education.\nMay your designs sell a ton, may your print beds be perfectly flat and level,\nmay you never run out of the print filament, and may you never run out; of adventure.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZgYtgTFDNk\n[2]: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/egCwG9FwWHQ\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q3uaepRCl4\n[4]: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/jjBMQ6VmdJO\n[5]: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/egCwG9FwWHQ\n[6]: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kkERsHNJQ0T\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_4H1OTIAK0\n[8]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/292024963/3d-printed-polyface-planter",

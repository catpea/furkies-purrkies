Ayn Rand says solve your contradictions,
check your premises and convictions.

But I think this is just a start,
even as a teenager I used to say that life is art.

I think it is all about an integrated mind,
in which all our knowledge is perfectly aligned.

Most schools teach an educational mix,
but those lessons are just stupid tricks.

All the good teachers have been cheated,
they've been fired and out-competed.

Schools sell the idea of balanced education,
but those words mark the death of every nation.

Balanced education is a meme,
a virus that will kill every dream.

Balanced sounds really good,
but this can ruin adulthood.

Even students will protect it with all their might,
never realizing, it is a blight.

Just imagine what would happen to Newton's mind,
he would have gone numb, mad, and blind.

A mix of ingredients ruins an education,
as our minds depend on a fixed constellation.

A mind without connections,
cannot set correct directions.

We graduate school convinced we know math,
but only the self taught can follow that path.

It is a horrible curse as many think; they know,
but their abilities fade as soon as they give something a go.

When you focus on the final result,
school will seem much like a cult.

Students are pretending to know,
and the teachers let them graduate and go.

A lot of it is about money and food on the table,
money makes the school unstable.

Before we get money out of politics,
to rid of all those bloodsucking ticks.

We need to get money out of corrupt schools,
and into student hands, as today they are being used as mere tools.

Here a self paced an self organized education,
will lead them to build start-ups with little hesitation.

That air of students reaching success,
will create a beautiful educational madness.

Once a student has a reason and direction,
they will build a path hat will afford them safety and protection.

Instead of asking: what do I do to graduate,
they will begin asking: what do I need to learn to create.

Lesson connected to lesson they will advance,
all they need is a long lasting chance.

The constellations are the real knowledge,
it is about connecting ideas, not some brand name college.

A real education that comes from the heart,
will always help students create their best art.

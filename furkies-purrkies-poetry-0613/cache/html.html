  <p>Ayn Rand says solve your contradictions,<br>check your premises and convictions.</p>
  <p>But I think this is just a start,<br>even as a teenager I used to say that life is art.</p>
  <p>I think it is all about an integrated mind,<br>in which all our knowledge is perfectly aligned.</p>

  <p>Most schools teach an educational mix,<br>but those lessons are just stupid tricks.</p>
  <p>All the good teachers have been cheated,<br>they've been fired and out-competed.</p>
  <p>Schools sell the idea of balanced education,<br>but those words mark the death of every nation.</p>
  <p>Balanced education is a meme,<br>a virus that will kill every dream.</p>
  <p>Balanced sounds really good,<br>but this can ruin adulthood.</p>
  <p>Even students will protect it with all their might,<br>never realizing, it is a blight.</p>

  <p>Just imagine what would happen to Newton's mind,<br>he would have gone numb, mad, and blind.</p>
  <p>A mix of ingredients ruins an education,<br>as our minds depend on a fixed constellation.</p>
  <p>A mind without connections,<br>cannot set correct directions.</p>
  <p>We graduate school convinced we know math,<br>but only the self taught can follow that path.</p>
  <p>It is a horrible curse as many think; they know,<br>but their abilities fade as soon as they give something a go.</p>
  <p>When you focus on the final result,<br>school will seem much like a cult.</p>
  <p>Students are pretending to know,<br>and the teachers let them graduate and go.</p>

  <p>A lot of it is about money and food on the table,<br>money makes the school unstable.</p>
  <p>Before we get money out of politics,<br>to rid of all those bloodsucking ticks.</p>
  <p>We need to get money out of corrupt schools,<br>and into student hands, as today they are being used as mere tools.</p>
  <p>Here a self paced an self organized education,<br>will lead them to build start-ups with little hesitation.</p>
  <p>That air of students reaching success,<br>will create a beautiful educational madness.</p>

  <p>Once a student has a reason and direction,<br>they will build a path hat will afford them safety and protection.</p>
  <p>Instead of asking: what do I do to graduate,<br>they will begin asking: what do I need to learn to create.</p>
  <p>Lesson connected to lesson they will advance,<br>all they need is a long lasting chance.</p>
  <p>The constellations are the real knowledge,<br>it is about connecting ideas, not some brand name college.</p>
  <p>A real education that comes from the heart,<br>will always help students create their best art.</p>

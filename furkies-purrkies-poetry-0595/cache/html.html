  <p>The world needs, universal income, world passports, free homes for all families,<br>real schools that produce meaningful results, wise tutors, and free libraries of lectures and beautiful narrated books.</p>
  <p>In return we ask the younger generations,<br>to lead the world to peace - to protect world peace.</p>
  <p>Imagine inviting world's students to speak to United Nations,<br>to enlighten and inspire the Governments, the Presidents, the Prime Ministers.</p>
  <p>And tasking them with protecting and advancing Equality and Liberty,<br>this is how we honor the younger generation and the future of Human Kind.</p>

  <p>Let Knowledge become peppered with great ideas as soon as possible,<br>while there is still time to dream seemingly impossible dreams.</p>
  <p>After all, we are just temporary caretakers of this world,<br>we are one link that connects to countless future generations.</p>
  <p>The cultures within which we grow up must encourage us to wisdom,<br>lo looking back for the most precious ideas that do us justice, and making them better.</p>
  <p>Search for Wisdom is a critical component in our growing up,<br>knowledge alone will make us easily manipulated by the worst of Human kind.</p>

  <p>Let me show you what a great being, who appreciates wisdom sounds like,<br>see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZYbTZLiWxo">Cornel West Interview in the Opening of Examined Life by Astra Taylor</a>.</p>
  <p>The quotes that leap into that man's mind as he speaks,<br>do not come from him being a teacher alone.</p>
  <p>They come from his Kingdom of Knowledge, from his Memory Palace,<br>from the books that changed his life, from the hopes he will never let go of.</p>

  <p>He is not just quoting other people,<br>he is rising on the shoulders of giants.</p>
  <p>Same as the giants,<br>upon whose solders he now stands.</p>
  <p>They too built on the highest of heights,<br>that the generations previous to them have reached.</p>
  <p>It is as simple as that,<br>to carry on the best ideas of the previous generations forward, and to make it even more meaningful.</p>

  <p>When hearing a Philosopher speak, it is not about agreement,<br>but appreciation of the unique wisdom being shared.</p>
  <p>Just like trees prefer a particular clime, minerals and length of seasons,<br>so does every Great Being grow from within a particular mix of ideas.</p>
  <p>But all Great Beings converge on wisdom,<br>in peace, kindness, great appreciation and great respect.</p>
  <p>As unique as the tree, at the root,<br>very much the same in hopes and dreams at the highest of heights.</p>
  <p>Greatness is unique, but universal,<br>it connects the human family together.</p>

  <p>Wisdom is an infinite thing,<br>there is no end to it.</p>
  <p>It is very childish to hope to contain all wisdom,<br>it is a mountain rage of many peaks, it is a tree of many branches.</p>
  <p>And all the authentic heights are equally powerful,<br>equally beautiful, and equally endless.</p>

  <p>The collection of the many infinite branches of wisdom is the single most important gift we have for the younger generations,<br>the gift has been sewn into countless books that the world - in its unshakable reason - holds in highest esteem.</p>
  <p>We send the little ones to schools that turn them away from books pointing them towards meaningless grades,<br>we sell many on the idea of free college for the mere price of joining the military, to fight in wars we do nothing to prevent.</p>

  <p>Real education can only be stolen for so long,<br>because in the absence of teachers the students will become teachers.</p>
  <p>They will take to thousands of books,<br>and go around ineffective education, and meaningless jobs.</p>
  <p>Parents should make sure that education is meaningful,<br>that the hopes and dreams of Universal Equality and Liberty are evolving well.</p>
  <p>At the very least,<br>we must remind the students to become Great Lovers of Wisdom.</p>
  <p>We have to help them to understand that they are meant to become Great Beings,<br>from Knowledge and Adventure emerges Wisdom and Strength, and that in turn serves as the foundation for greatness and Foresight.</p>

Alexandra was the final leader overseeing the delivery of the cards,
though it was largely a symbolic position, her smile was captured in countless paintings.
In the speech, with which the era of traditional leadership came to a close,
she recounted the history in three steps.
Though she was still in middle school,
she was considered an expert by her peers.
She said, that it didn't take very much to remove a king,
that even the knights of the round table would age and pass leaving a power vacuum for mad men to step into.
And she drew a line between a single symbolic leader,
and a table of twelve, extrapolating it to encompass the entirety of humanity.
Before she stepped down with a smile, that could only come from a job well done,
she uttered a phrase that would later grace the World Passport:
All of us or none.

  <p>Naked Emperors are, what Naked Emperors do,<br>don't let them fool you.</p>
  <p>Eventually it all runs its course,<br>and even then they will only rule so long with force.</p>
  <p>We see this in how Rome met its fate,<br>where wisdom was seen as a crime against state.</p>
  <p>And there is no arguing that,<br>either have real education or fall flat.</p>

  <p>I understand that nobody likes transformations,<br>but you will not know any of these nations.</p>
  <p>To put it mildly, we are not in range,<br>to witness the change.</p>
  <p>These ideas, the world, and nations,<br>are for the youngest of our generations.</p>
  <p>They have to be simple, tested and clear,<br>so that they may proceed without fear.</p>

  <p>There is nothing old,<br>about the design of the new world.</p>
  <p>Crime must be prevented at all cost,<br>because later too much lost.</p>
  <p>Thus Powerful Education, Therapy, and Mental Health come first,<br>the new schools must create a real scientific thirst.</p>
  <p>It is important to protect science,<br>as it will ensure multiple pathways to self reliance.</p>
  <p>But History Of Philosophy is above all else,<br>as it helps us rise out of our shells.</p>
  <p>Indoctrination will be seen as a crime,<br>we must set aims on wisdom this time.</p>

  <p>Human Beings are extremely special and each is unique,<br>we require a very particular learning technique.</p>
  <p>There must be no stress or punishment in class,<br>and teachers are forbidden to threaten or harass.</p>
  <p>Each student has a unique path and pace,<br>and all student must be taught on case by case.</p>
  <p>Organized education, grades and testing, is fraud,<br>and should be banned if not outlawed.</p>
  <p>There is no one school approach that will work for all,<br>but each student has a unique way to reach their goal.</p>
  <p>Each area of interest should have multiple doors,<br>and emerge multiple lessons as the student explores.</p>

  <p>To ensure accessibility, automation, tooling, and quality,<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO">the automated parts of schools should be built on a text-based virtual reality</a>.</p>
  <p>Rather than the teachers leading the lessons for all,<br>the students will be solving puzzles in a virtual dungeon crawl.</p>
  <p>All of this has to be editable, open source, and free,<br>so that it is allowed to grow like a great tree.</p>

  <p>As to solving poverty, one hundred dollars a day for one hundred years,<br>is three million and six hundred fifty thousand dollars.</p>
  <p>The new economy will grant each person this amount,<br>to spend across a lifetime.</p>
  <p>The card just comes with a 24 hour hundred dollar spending limit to ensure stability,<br>erasing a great deal of human suffering and vulnerability.</p>
  <p>Thus the new world will learn to use a new paradigm,<br>when dealing with crime.</p>
  <p>Criminals will require understanding, therapy and education,<br>proper care for those in need is one of the pillars of a stable nation.</p>

  <p>The formula of 365 days x one hundred dollars x one hundred years,<br>to erase all fears.</p>
  <p>A small plastic debit card with the symbol of a heart,<br>converting the mistake of money to one of our greatest works of art.</p>
  <p>And an earth passport, to remind us that we are the same, that we are one,<br>that we need to erase divisions, as we are one family under the sun.</p>

  <p>Alexandra was the final leader overseeing the delivery of the cards,<br>though it was largely a symbolic position, her smile was captured in countless paintings.</p>
  <p>In the speech, with which the era of traditional leadership came to a close,<br>she recounted the history in three steps.</p>
  <p>Though she was still in middle school,<br>she was considered an expert by her peers.</p>
  <p>She said, that it didn't take very much to remove a king,<br>that even the knights of the round table would age and pass leaving a power vacuum for mad men to step into.</p>
  <p>And she drew a line between a single symbolic leader,<br>and a table of twelve, extrapolating it to encompass the entirety of humanity.</p>
  <p>Before she stepped down with a smile, that could only come from a job well done,<br>she uttered a phrase that would later grace the World Passport:</p>
  <p>All of us or none.</p>

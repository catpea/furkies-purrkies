Naked Emperors are, what Naked Emperors do,
don't let them fool you.

Eventually it all runs its course,
and even then they will only rule so long with force.

We see this in how Rome met its fate,
where wisdom was seen as a crime against state.

And there is no arguing that,
either have real education or fall flat.

---

I understand that nobody likes transformations,
but you will not know any of these nations.

To put it mildly, we are not in range,
to witness the change.

These ideas, the world, and nations,
are for the youngest of our generations.

They have to be simple, tested and clear,
so that they may proceed without fear.

---

There is nothing old,
about the design of the new world.

Crime must be prevented at all cost,
because later too much lost.

Thus Powerful Education, Therapy, and Mental Health come first,
the new schools must create a real scientific thirst.

It is important to protect science,
as it will ensure multiple pathways to self reliance.

But History Of Philosophy is above all else,
as it helps us rise out of our shells.

Indoctrination will be seen as a crime,
we must set aims on wisdom this time.

---

Human Beings are extremely special and each is unique,
we require a very particular learning technique.

There must be no stress or punishment in class,
and teachers are forbidden to threaten or harass.

Each student has a unique path and pace,
and all student must be taught on case by case.

Organized education, grades and testing, is fraud,
and should be banned if not outlawed.

There is no one school approach that will work for all,
but each student has a unique way to reach their goal.

Each area of interest should have multiple doors,
and emerge multiple lessons as the student explores.

---

To ensure accessibility, automation, tooling, and quality,
[the automated parts of schools should be built on a text-based virtual reality][1].

Rather than the teachers leading the lessons for all,
the students will be solving puzzles in a virtual dungeon crawl.

All of this has to be editable, open source, and free,
so that it is allowed to grow like a great tree.

---

As to solving poverty, one hundred dollars a day for one hundred years,
is three million and six hundred fifty thousand dollars.

The new economy will grant each person this amount,
to spend across a lifetime.

The card just comes with a 24 hour hundred dollar spending limit to ensure stability,
erasing a great deal of human suffering and vulnerability.

Thus the new world will learn to use a new paradigm,
when dealing with crime.

Criminals will require understanding, therapy and education,
proper care for those in need is one of the pillars of a stable nation.

---

The laws require a virtual world where they can be defined,
to that the case can be simulated, contextualized and aligned.

In a world where crime is seen as mental breakdown,
human beings, not inmates, are built up, not stripped down.

---

It takes millions of people to build a stable new world,
and it requires retiring whatever has run its course and became broken or old.

But designing a world top down,
starts with just three things.

The formula of 365 days x one hundred dollars x one hundred years,
to erase all fears.

A small plastic debit card with the symbol of a heart,
converting the mistake of money to one of our greatest works of art.

And an earth passport, to remind us that we are the same, that we are one,
that we need to erase divisions, as we are one family under the sun.

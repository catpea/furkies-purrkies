In the morning I came up with this beauuuuutiful idea for the video book chapter,
and it was one of those branching chapters full of colors.

I got out of my bed,
ready to start my day.

And oh my gosh,
it turned out, my amazing idea; was just an empty dream.

I dreamt up a beautiful chapter,
without actually knowing what that chapter was about.

Thanks,
dreams.

On my way back upstairs,
to dream up the video chapter for real.

I walked by my bicycle,
and briefly pondered a missing screw in my mud guard.

It actually shipped that way,
as a result my rear fender wobbles left to right like a tail.

It has been like this for over a year,
I just don't have the right screws.

I have a light beneath here,
and it is kind of important.

---

One step...
one step after that, I froze with a mechanic's grin.

---

I flew upstairs to get my electronic digital calipers,
and started measuring the screw I did have.

And I took measurements of the mount holes in my fender,
and wrote it all down with my tongue slightly sticking out to the side.

Happy with all the information I gathered,
I begun MODELING THE SCREW in blender for 3D printing.

There is built in add-on for making bolts,
but I still needed to get the dimensions perfectly.

And I ended up creating two versions,
the second screw version has a slot for a quarter to use as a screw driver.

The first version was a scary perfect fit,
but the second crossed the line of perfection, into who knows what.

---

I made sure to document my development,
so that I could do a little poetic write up.

I don't know what is harder to believe for me,
how much fun I had... or that I can fabricate perfect screws at the tip of a hat.

---

I probably shouldn't say this,
but I will spend the entire Spring admiring those screws.

And of course,
after I fixed my fender.

I crossed my arms, lifted my head,
and looked down at the over-fourteen little things I can print out to trick out bicycle.

I think my favorite is a cheap little headlamp holder,
that I can slide into my handlebar.

If I ever ride at night,
I can blink at drivers left and right of me straight from the handlebar.

But I think the first thing I'll design,
is a sophisticated little noisemaker that will make a motorcycle sound with the spokes of my wheels.

Loud pipes,
save lives.

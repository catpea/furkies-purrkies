  <p>Upon my afternoon shower,<br>I discovered it lost power.</p>
  <p>I found with a with a frown,<br>that the water would neither go up nor down.</p>
  <p>The knob was spinning around,<br>making a cute little sound.</p>

  <p>I got it working again,<br>But I cam make it better - of yes I can.</p>
  <p>I already created a new design,<br>with multiple parts to make it shine.</p>
  <p>I like creatively re-designing some part,<br>it certainly is a form of art.</p>

  <p>The copper rod that holds the knob out,<br>needs a sleeve to square it - without a doubt.</p>
  <p>A generic solution will demand a lighter,<br>to heat up the PLA to make it fit tighter.</p>
  <p>And then over the squared rod,<br>I will slip a design that anybody can mod.</p>

  <p>This will be a generic solution,<br>it will help millions with their ablution.</p>
  <p>The square will accept many knob styles,<br>and help people shower with smiles.</p>
  <p>I am thinking about a lion's head,<br>but may start with something abstract instead.</p>

  <p>I will use white plastic to 3D print mine,<br>but that is not actually part of the design.</p>
  <p>It can be printed with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=metal+pla">metal-like PLA fillament</a>,<br>and that certainly is money well spent.</p>
  <p>My new design is sure to restore old showers,<br>and return them to their former powers.</p>

  <p>I like fixing things,<br>giving old designs new wings.</p>
  <p>3D modeling and printing is magical,<br>especially when the result is practical.</p>

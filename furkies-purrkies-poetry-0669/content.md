Upon my afternoon shower,
I discovered it lost power.

I found with a with a frown,
that the water would neither go up nor down.

The knob was spinning around,
making a cute little sound.

---

I got it working again,
But I cam make it better - of yes I can.

I already created a new design,
with multiple parts to make it shine.

I like creatively re-designing some part,
it certainly is a form of art.

---

The copper rod that holds the knob out,
needs a sleeve to square it - without a doubt.

A generic solution will demand a lighter,
to heat up the PLA to make it fit tighter.

And then over the squared rod,
I will slip a design that anybody can mod.

---

This will be a generic solution,
it will help millions with their ablution.

The square will accept many knob styles,
and help people shower with smiles.

I am thinking about a lion's head,
but may start with something abstract instead.

---

I will use white plastic to 3D print mine,
but that is not actually part of the design.

It can be printed with [metal-like PLA fillament][1],
and that certainly is money well spent.

My new design is sure to restore old showers,
and return them to their former powers.

---

I like fixing things,
giving old designs new wings.

3D modeling and printing is magical,
especially when the result is practical.

Perhaps my little poem can inspire you to [learn Blender][2],
and [get an Ender][3].

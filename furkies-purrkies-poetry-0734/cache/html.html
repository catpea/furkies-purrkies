  <p>Paintings have a truly unique power,<br>they can and should beautifully present things...</p>
  <p>That do not normally occur in the real world,<br>that you can't just snap a picture of.</p>

  <p>I am currently working on a group of silly animals,<br>who are not in proportion to each other.</p>
  <p>They have proportions,<br>that make a person smile.</p>
  <p>More over,<br>I think I may dress them up, for adventure.</p>

  <p>In a portrait I am hoping to somewhat finish today,<br>I am creating a crown of butterflies.</p>
  <p>Where butterflies chose,<br>to land in a fairie's hair.</p>

  <p>Photography wouldn't really work here,<br>nor would digital photo composition.</p>
  <p>As the butterflies for example,<br>have to create a song together.</p>
  <p>Splicing photos together can only go so far,<br>here the butterflies will need to shine bright and look cheerful.</p>
  <p>They can't look flat, they have to cast correct shadows,<br>and somewhat surprisingly they can't just be a random selection of butterflies.</p>
  <p>They need to create a color theme,<br>privately I can think of two themes Monarch Orange, and Dragonfly Iridescence.</p>
  <p>I just tested random butterflies,<br>and they created confusion - it is great to confuse birds...</p>
  <p>But not so good,<br>for a Fairie's Crown which is meant to be pretty.</p>

  <p>And while photography and photo manipulation is an art,<br>once you need to give your butterflies correct shadows...</p>
  <p>You are painting,<br>I don't care if it is called retouching - because what it really is, is digital painting.</p>

  <p>While dressing up a cat for adventure,<br>is an amazing project, especially is your cat has a super short fuse...</p>
  <p>It is probably better to take a photo of the kitty,<br>who will no doubt be furiously trying to figure out what the heck you are up to.</p>
  <p>And then dress up a doll,<br>and splice the pictures together.</p>
  <p>At which point, one will have more artistic freedom,<br>when just painting the clothes on, using photos as reference.</p>

  <p>It would be unfair to burden a clever photographer,<br>with so much custom alterations.</p>
  <p>That is where a digital painter,<br>comes in.</p>

  <p>So, digital photography, can go far,<br>but...it gets harder and harder as you go deeper and deeper into the worlds of fantasy.</p>
  <p>Digital painting, on the other hand, especially when using digital photography as reference,<br>makes the entry into the worlds of fantasy fun and easy.</p>

  <p>Moreover, your painting will become much better if you take a moment,<br>to remember; to paint <strong>beyond</strong> what digital photography and editing is capable of.</p>
  <p>You want photographers to look at your painting and and say,<br>"Well, shucks I couldn't take a photo like that in a million years."</p>
  <p>Let the world of photography belong to photographers,<br>as to you - the digital painter - belongs the world... of fantasy.</p>

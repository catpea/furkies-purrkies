  <p>Becoming a Philosopher,<br>is an important part of learning and growing up.</p>
  <p>And you are certainly,<br>not supposed to wait for your golden age.</p>
  <p>Golden Age has it own wisdom,<br>the philosopher in you starts when you start.</p>

  <p>Three are many heights to climb,<br>and you can pretty much feel when you reach a new height.</p>
  <p>You rise up on a plateau,<br>wiser, stronger, more powerful, and with a greater clarity of vision.</p>
  <p>Sometimes it happens without even trying,<br>merely rejecting the easier wrong and taking the harder right, elevates us.</p>

  <p>Word of caution,<br>people who can't become Philosophers exist.</p>
  <p>But this is not a permanent condition,<br>it is a mixture of unhealthy things that stand in their way.</p>
  <p>Stress, overwork, servitude, following orders,<br>and making other people's lives easier.</p>

  <p>And a simple test of this state, is,<br>can you enjoy an audio book?</p>
  <p>You don't have to read it,<br>you just need to listen and flow.</p>
  <p>If you can't flow,<br>it means you got to pack for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Appalachian Trail</a>, often.</p>

  <p>It is not just the philosopher in you that fails to grow,<br>but also Authenticity, Dignity, Class, Creativity, Compassion.</p>
  <p>And certainly Knowledge, Wisdom, and Love Of Life,<br>and of course your Greatness; that depends on all these lovely items.</p>
  <p>This is an extreme danger, because all the decisions you make in that state,<br>are mostly incompatible with who you really are, and by extension the elder you.</p>

  <p>Philosophers, and the philosopher that you are meant to become,<br>are a force on the scale of the universe; A Universal Power.</p>
  <p>Philosophers get to see the lies and the future,<br>they can see where the lairs are.</p>
  <p>And like a mother can tell when their baby is lying,<br>they can watch lies in real time as they unfold before them.</p>

  <p>That you are meant to become a Philosopher on your way to growing all the way up,<br>is one of the most sacred things in the world.</p>
  <p>As a Philosopher, a Lover of Wisdom,<br>becomes the Keeper of Earth.</p>
  <p>Once we are allowed and encouraged to grow all the way up,<br>all the world problems will become repaired.</p>

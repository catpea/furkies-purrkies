  <p>Years ago,<br>in my Art adventures,</p>
  <p>I'd put on the classy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klJucNTR2fE&list=OLAK5uy_kZjiPamnbPhbSNLTJRUu3fxssG5cinoXo">Coralie Cl√©ment</a><br>and drive to the Biggest Bookstore I found.</p>

  <p>Looking at pencil drawing tutorials,<br>taught me the importance of creating Art Books.</p>
  <p>And looking thorough reference graphics for designers,<br>was as abstract and random, as fascinating.</p>
  <p>I thumbed through thick books,<br>filled with stickers, logos, and doodles - it was a amazing.</p>

  <p>I wasn't looking for anything in particular,<br>so I started in the beginning.</p>
  <p>Week after week,<br>I'd inspect new art books, sometimes new arrivals even.</p>
  <p>And eventually I found a book with Lowbrow art,<br>or Pop Surrealism.</p>

  <p>This was not a happy moment for me,<br>Pop Surrealism is on another level.</p>
  <p>Seeing the beauty of Realism,<br>taken to Cartoons.</p>
  <p>And actually made better, somehow;<br>was devastating for me.</p>
  <p>I feel like, <strong>that day</strong>,<br>lowbrow broke my heart in a sweet Surrealist way.</p>
  <p>I couldn't do anything like it,<br>I couldn't even move oils like that.</p>
  <p>And I certainly have not been ready,<br>to witness anything that beautiful.</p>

  <p>Even hours ago,<br>the eyes I drew on my new Mona, were tiny compared to what I needed.</p>
  <p>And this very hour, I discovered that I needed to resize her body,<br>down to almost the size of her fancy head.</p>
  <p>I am still being changed,<br>still being taught this silly magic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>I must have laughed four times at Mona's eyes,<br>and took several trips to the computer just to look at the screen again.</p>
  <p>I am laughing right now,<br>that forehead, is so perfect.</p>
  <p>And I just brightened up her eyes,<br>apparently enough to stare in to people's souls.</p>
  <p>That's art,<br>that's my kind of art.</p>
  <p>Funny,<br>as heck.</p>

  <p>My Grandma had a neat framed copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_with_an_Ermine">Lady with an Ermine</a> in her living room,<br>the original is in a Polish museum about three hours away.</p>
  <p>From my youngest age, I used to wonder about it,<br>I never got over how ferocious and muscular that animal is.</p>
  <p>I suspect that painting is the reason<br>why Squirrels make me so happy.</p>
  <p>I'll try learning with that one,<br>as well.</p>
  <p>With two or three celebrity portraits,<br>and a self-portrait or two, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/market/custom_portrait_from_photo">I could open up a little online store and take requests</a>.</p>

  <p>Where learning to paint does not benefit from tracing,<br>and is best done freehand by only looking at a reference.</p>
  <p>Custom portraits benefit from keeping as close as possible to the original,<br>and that is also more reliable and faster.</p>
  <p>At $25 or $50 per digital portrait,<br>it is a fun way to build a mighty portfolio.</p>
  <p>The customer can then request that a local print-shop prints it out on glossy paper,<br>and have it framed - this completely eliminates shipping and workmanship problems.</p>

  <p>Every little hobby,<br>leads to some interesting little way to make a dollar or two.</p>
  <p>It also opens up the opportunity to create speed painting or time lapse advertising videos,<br>where you could them offer their full versions with a tutorial commentary for a fee.</p>
  <p>You can also create an art book,<br>that would make someone browsing books at the local bookstore pause.</p>
  <p>And beyond that, what sells for $25 dollars, can make $250,<br>if you co-found a small company with other artists.</p>
  <p>A purely digital remote job,<br>where you can even train others how to create the art; and where they in turn, can sharpen their skills.</p>

  <p>The point of Art is not money,<br>art is about expanding your creativity with magnificent practice.</p>
  <p>Art makes you stronger,<br>and art makes you laugh.</p>

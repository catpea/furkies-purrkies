    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Looking at pencil drawing tutorials,<br>taught me the importance of creating Art Books.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And looking thorough reference graphics for designers,<br>was as abstract and random, as fascinating.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I thumbed through thick books,<br>filled with stickers, logos, and doodles - it was a amazing.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I feel like, <strong>that day</strong>,<br>lowbrow broke my heart in a sweet Surrealist way.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can also create an art book,<br>that would make someone browsing books at the local bookstore pause.</div>

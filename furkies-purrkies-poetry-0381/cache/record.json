Philosophy called to me.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Then just get 15 audio books about it,</p>\n  <p>sometimes books that don&apos;t come out well as audio books, are just not that good.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Audio books,</p>\n  <p>may just mark the elite of books worth investing time it,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Einstein said,</p>\n  <p>&quot;If you can&apos;t explain it simply, you don&apos;t understand it well enough.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So if a book doesn&apos;t explain something valuable and magnificent, simply,</p>\n  <p>it probably relates to another quote which goes:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>&quot;There&apos;s a sucker born every minute&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So just keep an eye out for the fake charts,</p>\n  <p>designed to sell garbage meant to pray on uneducated readers,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Or charts that that see nothing wrong when the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Politicians+Buy+Their+Own+Books\">pseudo-authors buy their own books with campaign money</a>,</p>\n  <p>and then use the profits from book sales to launder the money further.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The beautiful thing about real books,</p>\n  <p>is that they help you figure out who the world&apos;s true leaders are.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They often greatly admire each other,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DKhc1pcDFM\">so once you find one</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4QPz52Sfo\">there will be a bunch more</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can see what happens,</p>\n  <p>out on the edge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You pull yourself out by your own bootstraps,</p>\n  <p>from all the noise and chaos that you accepted because you were too young to question it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I still remember the teacher saying &quot;You need to learn math because you won&apos;t always have a calculator on hand&quot;,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://github.com/catpea/math-as-code\">but what I was saying was: you need a computer to learn math for real</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Because I could see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZ26vj4vFM\">there was real fun to be had with mathematics it truly is a beautiful invention</a>,</p>\n  <p>but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YokKp3pwVFc\">teaching formulas without explanation is destroys that beauty, math teachers in their madness are destroying the beauty of mathematics</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>One of the anchors that helps me remember problems in middle school,</p>\n  <p>is being accused of cheating on homework, the teacher gave me a bad grade for an impressive (if I may) program I wrote my self.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This made my bullies laugh at me, of course,</p>\n  <p>they saw me pacing up and down the enormous corridors writing that program on a piece of paper for days.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In some cases,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY\">school can easily destroy us</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The damage caused by fantasy education of nonsense-lecture-and-brainless-test is unspeakable,</p>\n  <p>pretty much everything broken right now, is because the schools are broken.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I write this in 2021 as the vaccines are just about to become accessible,</p>\n  <p>the vaccine hesitancy problem that is about to be reveled is a perfect example of the damage fake education has caused.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just to make it more personal, after the masks are no longer going to be required, you will see husbands bringing the virus home,</p>\n  <p>and making their family sick, because their level of education trickles them into thinking the &quot;vaccines has problems&quot;, or to quote another case &quot;vaccines have chemicals&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The gravity of the damage, can bring down entire nations,</p>\n  <p>without anybody noticing what has gone wrong and where; they will still talk about paying off college debt and giving more money to the teachers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nobody in politics will notice, or believe, that schools have caused this,</p>\n  <p>because it is too complicated for their context, outside of their field of whatever.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>More than the middle school, or calculator nonsense, our parents are doing something similar where it comes to College and Career,</p>\n  <p>the correct path is Real Education and Entrepreneurship.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>College and Career are so popular, and there is so much money in this,</p>\n  <p>that there was never a chance that this could withstand corruption.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Getting fired should not be a threat,</p>\n  <p>getting replaced by younger, or just more cunning employees should not be a threat in your life.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You need a better plan than College and Career,</p>\n  <p>and a life where you can live in balance, and with a solid grasp on reality.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>By this time,</p>\n  <p>you&apos;ll have a fire going, you don&apos;t always have to go to the beach to watch the sunset.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You maybe, sharpening a stick,</p>\n  <p>a sausage can be a pretty tasty treat after a day of going up and down dunes in search of some mysterious lost lake, or leg of trail, or just following a goose.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>See, your thoughts no longer flow from the middle out,</p>\n  <p>they now come from the edge, they get under the things.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>you don&apos;t just look at what is before you,</p>\n  <p>but that the many hings that connect to it, that may dictate the future ahead of you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It if feels like you are a Castaway,</p>\n  <p>it is only because Humans are not meant to be alone, we are tribal creatures.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your Audio Books, will connect you with the others,</p>\n  <p>and you will know deep down that they are important enough to override that curse of the cast away, your soul needs Philosophy and Wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Since it is a small wilderness, or later on a popular trail like the AT,</p>\n  <p>you won&apos;t feel like a Castaway for long, your Audio Books will be connecting you to all the world&apos;s true leaders, it won&apos;t feel lonely.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But, if you have friends,</p>\n  <p>bring them along.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It rained pretty bad once, and then a thunderstorm came,</p>\n  <p>this is exactly what you should expect to find, out on the edge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are now part of the universe,</p>\n  <p>might as well be camping on a distant moon.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Make sure that flash floods won&apos;t wash away any of your gear,</p>\n  <p>and find a spot where it is safe when a great storm comes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Check for trees that are about to fall, and keep away from those,</p>\n  <p>if you can&apos;t find a good spot, then know of a safe spot where you can move on a rainy day.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A great storm, is terrifying,</p>\n  <p>but it is also a great honor.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Every other Adventurer and Creature of Renaissance before you,</p>\n  <p>had to endure storms just as big, plan ahead, enjoy the fragrance of the woods.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I curled up in my sleeping bag,</p>\n  <p>put on my headphones and started playing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk\">We Are All Connected</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I didn&apos;t wait for the storm to pass,</p>\n  <p>the headphones were enough to dull the thunder.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I fell asleep to the storm,</p>\n  <p>it wasn&apos;t that uncomfortable.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the morning everything seemed greener,</p>\n  <p>I think there were deer by the lake.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It was chilly, but just as soon as the sun comes out from behind the ancient dune, things will warm up,</p>\n  <p>and you can take a walk to a sunny spot.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>One time I saw a storm on the horizon,</p>\n  <p>it looked beautiful, but I got scared, it didn&apos;t even occur to me that it was probably too far, there were no clouds overhead.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My plan was to back up and run for the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/uyJTDb7TLimJfqiLA\">trail end</a>, which I did and I just slept there in my little tent,</p>\n  <p>even though the storm did not come.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I was sure it would, because I think, I am pretty sure, maybe, the grass had a very faint bluish outline,</p>\n  <p>which seemed to me like static electricity and a sign of trouble.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It looked very beautiful,</p>\n  <p>it looked very magical.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But with a storm flashing out on the horizon,</p>\n  <p>I wasn&apos;t taking any chances, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/6VbSgS27hpvCvHMV8\">I was right by the lake</a>, on top of a little dune with a larger camping spot right behind it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If I was lightening,</p>\n  <p>that was the spot I would hit first, so. I. moved.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the morning I had the pleasure of looking for a new spot,</p>\n  <p>and I found one, that reminded me of a top of a volcano.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I spent many days there daydreaming, and listening to books,</p>\n  <p>I had a paper copy of Robinson Cruse and I lazily read that too.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I didn&apos;t really pack up and drive away,</p>\n  <p>I went to the other parking site on Forest Trail, I slept at the State Park again.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I only packed up to leave,</p>\n  <p>when leaving was all that was left.</p>\n</div>",

I. moved.\nIn the morning I had the pleasure of looking for a new spot,\nand I found one, that reminded me of a top of a volcano.\nI spent many days there daydreaming, and listening to books,\nI had a paper copy of Robinson Cruse and I lazily read that too.\nI didn't really pack up and drive away,\nI went to the other parking site on Forest Trail, I slept at the State Park again.\nI only packed up to leave,\nwhen leaving was all that was left.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.google.com/search?q=Politicians+Buy+Their+Own+Books\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DKhc1pcDFM\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4QPz52Sfo\n[4]: https://github.com/catpea/math-as-code\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZ26vj4vFM\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YokKp3pwVFc\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk\n[9]: https://goo.gl/maps/uyJTDb7TLimJfqiLA\n[10]: https://goo.gl/maps/6VbSgS27hpvCvHMV8",

  <p>The Queen Of Queens who never Bows To Kings,<br>and a keeper of all the doggie things.</p>
  <p>She who united squirrels, dogs and cats,<br>and to this day encourages them to wear tiny little hats.</p>
  <p>It is a golden age of pet fashion,<br>and all should dress with a passion.</p>
  <p>She herself is a true charmer,<br>and rides on a little horse in golden armor.</p>
  <p>And she truly deeply adores,<br>her silly little horse.</p>
  <p>At home she dresses in a pink sweater of wool,<br>that makes her feel cozy and cheerful.</p>

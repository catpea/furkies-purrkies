need to sketch out the proper proportions first,\nthen you have to use white and gray to get the shadows perfect, so use a black and white photo for this part.\nAnd then you gently add a transparent layer of color,\nwhile it is a bit more complex you desaturate colors by mixing them with opposites on the color wheel[2].\nHaving a while and black under-painting really helps,\nbut it is the color mixing that oil paintings really benefits from[3].\nThe thing about oil paint is that it does not dry very quickly,\nit gives you the ability to keep tweaking your painting.\nAcrylics are another choice,\nthey don't mix anywhere as easy as oils, they just dry.\nAnd watercolors, are wonderful, once you have a sketch,\nyou don't color by mixing a color up and then using that color directly on paper, but you color in layer on really think paper.\nIn that way Watercolors and Oils give you time to make adjustments and change things,\nacrylics however, let you easily paint over something you didn't like, they are very opaque.\n\nAlways work on a series of portraits on a singe subject,\nit can be people's portraits, it can be people's pets, or it can be vistas, or just Mona Lisas.\nBut in the beginning you always have to sketch out the subject with pencils first,\nthere are cheap pico projectors that can connect directly to the phone you snapped a photo with[4], so it can't be easier.\nI have fond memories of drawing a series of Raccoon portraits in my post Mona Lisa phase,\nI was just using photos from the internet, which is not perfect, because you don't feel connected to the kitty, you have to take your own pictures first.\nOne time in a coffeehouse, I was approached by a watercolor artist that described her artwork as whimsical,\nI started talking about using office projectors, sometimes even connected to programs like GIMP[5] where one can study photographs by reducing number of colors for example.\nAt first she didn't care to listen what I was saying, but then, all of a sudden, she got it, her eyes lit up in a way that spoke \"I need a projector\",\nand then she flew out the door, never to return, ever again.\nAnother time, I remember stopping by Ann Arbor's Ambrosia to have a little relaxing drawing session,\nand the subject of my internet raccoon drawings came up.\nPeople gathered around and I proudly paraded my Trash Panda Kitties,\nI was like \"Oh, I just started on this one\", \"And did you see the one where I gave them monocles?\" - that one is still my favorite, becoming an artist is really fun.\nAdventures help us become artists because they give us the opportunity to take photos in just the perfect way,\nthen all you need to do is discover your favorite method of transferring the outline of your subject to canvas or on paper, and you are ready to go.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK4Uo5QvH6M\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQYcG4Km1-k\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNB3XY67Q-I\n[4]:

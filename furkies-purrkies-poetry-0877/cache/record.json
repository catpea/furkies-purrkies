  "text": "Let me show you a couple of strange ways,\nwith which creativity and thus mental health can be upset.\nOne describes strangeness or elitism as the case may be, in art community,\nwhere young people are pushed away from joining, by being forced into pointless tricks.\nAnd the other is a broader example from the programmer community,\nwhere a programmer just asked about burnout and loss of creativity[1].\n\nThe point of this text is to remind all that,\nthat our minds need room to grow and keep healthy.\nAnd while poverty is terrifying and deadly, is is a mistake,\nthat humanity will eventually repair.\nTo get to that point,\nwe must allow our creativity to flourish.\n\nThe hateful artists will say,\nyou can’t use a reference image directly.\nThey are doing this,\nto elevate themselves above you.\n\nPlease don’t actually do what I am about to describe,\nthat is just a dumb waste of time.\nTake your source image, a portrait for example,\ncover it with a transparency or a see through bag.\nTake a dry erase marker,\nand connect the eyes to the tip of the nose.\nNow, look at the triangle you just made,\nstudy it, and very gently with a pencil at first, put it on your canvas.\nNow connect something on the face to the ears\njust pick something, and copy that shape too.\nNow the two shapes on the canvas,\nmark all the important points on the face.\nNow connect the dots,\nand congratulations...\nYou just wasted three minutes,\non not just putting an x where the eyes are.\nNow, I had you do this awful thing,\nto show you how other artists, all those really nice people, PUSH YOU AROUND.\n\nDO NOT, let them poison art,\nuse your reference images directly[2].\nAnd if anybody challenges you,\nyou tell them that slightly crooked portraits with misshapen features are not art.\n\nWhen you finish your painting,\nyou grab everyone near you by their ears.\nAn you teach them,\nhow to be an artist too - without the stupid shapes.\n\nNow onto the second,\nbroader example,\nThink about horses, there are the wild ones out by Rocky Mountains,\nthey are wise, dumb, useless, and probably bite, but they are not warped.\nAnd then there are the ones beaten or pressed into submission,\nthey are raced, bread, doped, fed ... stressed out an over medicated.\nA healthy human being cannot keep focus on a single thing, we are not machines,\nwe are dreamers, explorers, adventures and inventors.\nWhen programmers complain about focus and loss of passion for personal projects,\nis a sign of health, of his system resisting becoming broken in.\nHe is still in part a wild horse,\nand the truth is, once he is broken in - he will never have passion to invent again.\nNot without medication, for a cultural disorder,\nin a culture that calls for workers to work all their lives...\nFailing that,\nmarks them as having a deficit.\n\nOur minds cannot do just one thing over and over,\nwe need to switch subjects, curiosities.\nVacation is an example of switching,\nlook how your health returns.\nGetting a writers block,\nis an example of the opposite.\nOf having focused on a singe task so long,\nthat the task is depleted of the fizz that comes with approaching a subject that calls to you.\nMy goodness, every person in the word,\nwill always tell a person like that, to take a break, to do something else.\nAnd yet we don’t apply the same to ourselves,\nwe instead walk into a doctor’s office and tell them we can’t focus.\nOh, he’ll give you medication all right,\nbut at the cost of your creativity for everything else.\nYou will medicate your natural predispositions away,\nand chemically break yourself in.\nJust wait until it comes out that schools have been purposefully over medicating[3],\nand tolerating student drug use to increase school’s collective GPA[4].\nAnd psychologists tolerated it because they defined the disorder,\nnot relative to a healthy mind.\nBut relative to the majority of modern culture,\nit became a disorder, because everyone is overworked.\n\nThere is more to it, Humanity does not have to be chained by poverty,\nthere is a better way to use the concept of money.\nBut to get there, majority must recognize adventure, creativity and ahealthy mind,\nas something that must be protected, not medicated away, to become a convenient employee.\n\nAfterword.\nI am not familiar with the Attention Deficit Disorder, I do believe that it is a real condition, and that there is medicine that helps.\nBut like Sir Ken Robinson,\nI suspect, that there is also a fictitious epidemic.\nLet me put it this way, if corporations are ever allowed,\nto prescribe their employees anti-depressants that improve productivity.\nAnd if schools are ever allowed to prescribe their students medication,\nthat temporary enhanced their focus and retention... long therm be damned.\nThey will do it, it maybe hard for you to believe,\nso let me put it this way.\nSchools will sell out their students for anything involving money[5],\nby providing them with a mix of facts that they can temporary memorize pass state tests.\nAnd corporations will maximize profits,\nat the cost of the well being of their employees.\n\nI do not have proof for any of this,\nbut I am certain that Authentic Self Education, is far more powerful, than standardized education[6].\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32226910\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fEMJp70tGU\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HInN7t4Zl04\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqWnumbraI4\n[5]: https://slate.com/business/2022/07/college-financial-aid-sham.html\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY",

makes more than $10,000 month.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But now that you are building a network of clones,</p>\n  <p>you have to ask how much does a clone-company like that

whatever money poor people had left,</p>\n  <p>as an example of who not to do business with.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>See <a

class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the end, come your age of wisdom, building a company that does nothing to help poor people,</p>\n  <p>is not worth your time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That clever $1 down to trap a person into a legally binding contract,</p>\n  <p>is a disgrace, an insult, and just as predatory as relying on bounced checks and other customer fees for a big share of your profits.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<p>Now, the easy part,</p>\n<p>as to the structure of your company...</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t invent anything new,</p>\n  <p>clone what others wish they could own.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>After all, your business is about selling clones of a fetching company,</p>\n  <p>and later on, about letting your clients pick from many templates of successful companies.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I am convinced many of your clients will own multiple clones,</p>\n  <p>and they will use them to reinforce one another.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>On the front-end, are things that make the customer of a clone company happy,</p>\n  <p>on the back-end is the administrator zone, AND! a place for freelancers to perform whatever actions the company needs to grow.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example, imagine City Photography, Inc,</p>\n  <p>which is patterned after <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">Unsplash</a> owned by two teenager co-founders.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They are coordinating photography projects from all the cities in United States,</p>\n  <p>all the photographs are free to use without registration, the participating photographers, can win awards, get a beautiful portfolio and job experience.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This company makes money from product and business placement,</p>\n  <p>from the brand names that models wear, and the cars that appear in exclusive photos.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>These two teenagers, want to photograph all the landmarks in United States,</p>\n  <p>and they can achieve that by putting a small monetary bounty on particular landmarks.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They may request slow motion video, time lapse photography, tilt shift photography,</p>\n  <p>areal drone photography, and set the bounties as needed.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Over time, they will discover more ways of monetizing,</p>\n  <p>because monetization depends on their users.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example, City Photography, Inc can allow its users to give each other Monetary Tips, including monthly,</p>\n  <p>and then take a small percentage of that, this would represent maybe 5% of their moneymaking.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There would be many more ways that City Photography, Inc takes an unobtrusive cut of something,</p>\n  <p>this may include brand names advertising their labels on the front page, popular users paying for a spotlight and so on.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>City Photography, Inc may grow, it maybe purchased by a larger company as the case it with Unsplash,</p>\n  <p>or it may fade away releasing all its photographs to Web Archive, or similar under the Public Domain license.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The number one deciding factor for what will happen to a company is the chaos and randomness of the business world,</p>\n  <p>the number two deciding factor is timing, if high quality photography is something that the world is interested in, then they will thrive.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The end of life for City Photography, Inc,</p>\n  <p>is just a new beginning for out two co-founders, no longer teenagers now, but just as sharp and passionate about business and big dreams.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They will take to another type of business you sell,</p>\n  <p>as they will now be intricately familiar with what it is like to engage in running a company, with a remote-work back-end that cater to freelancers around the world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In closing,</p>\n  <p>create a beautiful little company, have fun with it, and when you are done covert it into a template,</p>\n  <p>and begin selling clones of that company to others.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t stop here, look to other businesses that are fun to use, launch, run,</p>\n  <p>and copy them, bring in their template into your system so that people that buy companies from you can have multiple choices.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And don&apos;t be evil, don&apos;t bother with companies that do nothing for those who live in poverty,</p>\n  <p>they are not worth your time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Come your final days, no matter how many times you will say to yourself &quot;I made a difference&quot;,</p>\n  <p>you will never fully believe it, unless you truly did make a different, unless you truly did grow to become a Great Being that helped the world grow.</p>\n</div>",

  "text": "The Trembling Giant is a clonal colony of aspen determined to be a single living organism,\nand assumed to have one massive underground root system, it contains 47,000 trees.\n\nThis text is about taking your first beautiful company,\nwith an imaginative and eye catching product...\nAnd then making a much more powerful business out of it,\nby selling its clones to many business people.\n\nWhere your original product sold for $29.99,\nthe clones of companies that make that product will bring you a much greater figure.\nA company represents a dream, people will pay for the upfront setup,\nand then pay you monthly until the company is fully paid off.\nSo you go from $29.99 to relatively impossibly-large-figures,\nby simply abandoning your product and selling copies of your company.\n\nNow, here a hardened business person will check me,\nno doubt to share a wisdom valuable for brick and mortar shops.\nAnd here comes the first warning, do not open a physical location,\nand don't deal with anything that requires a warehouse.\nLet me make that clear, no physical goods, no building improvements and remodeling, no cleaning supplies, no employee uniforms,\nno equipment repairs and maintenance, no HVAC maintenance, no miscellaneous supplies, no mortgage or lease payments, no physical location,\nno signage, no utilities; or it will bleed you dry and push you into a bankruptcy (which is much better than school loans)\nDo not create a business that will consume your company,\nif it stops making money for a few months.\nYou have to create a machine that only comes to life when a sale is made,\nthat only extracts fees from a ready made sale.\n\nRemember, you are selling copies of this company,\nyour customers should only see a simple relationship between advertising and sales, that is it.\nThe company must be easily operated via the internet,\nand as 2020 taught us great emphasis should be placed on telecommuting, or remote jobs.\nArtificial Intelligence is not going to get here any time soon,\nif anything AI is just a stupid trick that corporations use to cut expenses by replacing employees with touchscreens for customers.\nAnd AI can only emerge of out accidents,\nit will not be a system that will be able to improve it self, it will never know how it works.\nThere are Eight Billion People out there,\nan you are building a lightweight company that only calls for employees when something needs to be done.\nThis could mean that the company goes dormant during incompatible times[1],\nor that you keep employing more and more and more and more, but only when there is more and more work to be done.\nAs the job queue becomes smaller,\nthe number of workers you employ in your template company will scale down.\nOnce you sell 1,000 such companies, 1,000 copies of that original,\nthe regulars won't really care if they are working for a clone in Bangalore, Johannesburg, or Rio.\n\nPremature optimization and automation is your friend,\nsqueeze everything down to the most robotic and lightweight implementation.\nThat will be your seed,\nyou will now be able to see what is constricting it.\nToo much automation, not enough variability,\nimpossible growth due to over optimization in a particular fragment.\nAll of these anomalies reveal pathways towards growth,\nand whatever does function in its lightweight mode can only make the company better.\n\nLet us look at that original business, the template,\nif that is all you wanted to build, you would aim for something that makes more than $10,000 month.\nBut now that you are building a network of clones,\nyou have to ask how much does a clone-company like that need-to-make-a-month to sell well.\nIt could be 1,000 with minimal advertising,\nthere are millions of people in this world who would be happy to make 1,000 a month.\nHow much should you sell a 1,000 a month company for,\nmaybe $24,000, maybe $50,000.\nAnd how are those people going to pay that sum?\nnow listen carefully.\nYou are not allowed to put people desperate for money,\nin more debt, the banks that used to do that employed the worst kinds of human beings.\nThey will pay you with a fair percent of their monthly income,\nif $100 is all they will make on that particular month, then all you will get is a $10 towards that $24,000.\nMake sure to hold up the banks that stole whatever money poor people had left,\nas an example of who not to do business with.\nSee TCF Bank tricked customers into expensive overdrafts, federal agency says[2], TCF experiments with new overdraft fee policy[3],\nand CFPB’s TCF Bank Overdraft Fee Case Has Echoes of Wells Fargo’s Fraud[4]\n\nIn the end, come your age of wisdom, building a company that does nothing to help poor people,\nis not worth your time.\nThat clever $1 down to trap a person into a legally binding contract,\nis a disgrace, an insult, and just as predatory as relying on bounced checks and other customer fees for a big share of your profits.\n\nNow, the easy part,\n\nas to the structure of your company...\n\nDon't invent anything new,\nclone what others wish they could own.\nAfter all, your business is about selling clones of a fetching company,\nand later on, about letting your clients pick from many templates of successful companies.\nI am convinced many of your clients will own multiple clones,\nand they will use them to reinforce one another.\n\nOn the front-end, are things that make the customer of a clone company happy,\non the back-end is the administrator zone, AND! a place for freelancers to perform whatever actions the company needs to grow.\nFor example, imagine City Photography, Inc,\nwhich is patterned after Unsplash[5] owned by two teenager co-founders.\nThey are coordinating photography projects from all the cities in United States,\nall the photographs are free to use without registration, the participating photographers, can win awards, get a beautiful portfolio and job experience.\nThis company makes money from product and business placement,\nfrom the brand names that models wear, and the cars that appear in exclusive photos.\nThese two teenagers, want to photograph all the landmarks in United States,\nand they can achieve that by putting a small monetary bounty on particular landmarks.\nThey may request slow motion video, time lapse photography, tilt shift photography,\nareal drone photography, and set the bounties as needed.\nOver time, they will discover more ways of monetizing,\nbecause monetization depends on their users.\nFor example, City Photography, Inc can allow its users to give each other Monetary Tips, including monthly,\nand then take a small percentage of that, this would represent maybe 5% of their moneymaking.\nThere would be many more ways that City Photography, Inc takes an unobtrusive cut of something,\nthis may include brand names advertising their labels on the front page, popular users paying for a spotlight and so on.\nCity Photography, Inc may grow, it maybe purchased by a larger company as the case it with Unsplash,\nor it may fade away releasing all its photographs to Web Archive, or similar under the Public Domain license.\nThe number one deciding factor for what will happen to a company is the chaos and randomness of the business world,\nthe number two deciding factor is timing, if high quality photography is something that the world is interested in, then they will thrive.\nThe end of life for City Photography, Inc,\nis just a new beginning for out two co-founders, no longer teenagers now, but just as sharp and passionate about business and big dreams.\nThey will take to another type of business you sell,\nas they will now be intricately familiar with what it is like to engage in running a company, with a remote-work back-end that cater to freelancers around the world.\n\nIn closing,\ncreate a beautiful little company, have fun with it, and when you are done covert it into a template,\nand begin selling clones of that company to others.\nDon't stop here, look to other businesses that are fun to use, launch, run,\nand copy them, bring in their template into your system so that people that buy companies from you can have multiple choices.\nAnd don't be evil, don't bother with companies that do nothing for those who live in poverty,\nthey are not worth your time.\nCome your final days, no matter how many times you will say to yourself \"I made a difference\",\nyou will never fully believe it, unless you truly did make a different, unless you truly did grow to become a Great Being that helped the world grow.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNpx7gpSqbY\n[2]:

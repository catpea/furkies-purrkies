    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This allows them to put a house on a woodland background,<br>and then a person wearing a suit in the foreground, and then a face on top of that person, from somewhere else.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They are splicing a scene together,<br>it is a kind of art.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Digitally clipping collages is a very useful technique for assembling your scenes,<br>when you assemble a collage that covers all the features of your painting...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can simply focus on painting,<br>as you have now assembled everything in it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Creating a digital collage prior to painting gives you three big things,<br>a glimpse of your finished work, shape reference for everything in it, and of course colors.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you download a squirrel from the internet,<br>or better yet chase one around your neighborhood until you get a good photo...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Your photo becomes a hundred times more useful,<br>if you get rid of the background and just keep the squirrel.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As a bonus, if you have a scurry of squirrels, you can easily arranged them,<br>because they are cut out for you, and the backgrounds don't get in your way.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There are two ways to cut something out of a digital photo,<br>using the lasso tool, or my means of masking.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you chop something off with the lasso tool,<br>it is gone forever.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But with masking, it is just using black to hide something, and white to keep it on the screen,<br>so if you make a mistake and cut something off with black, just put some white in there to get it back.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You usually have to add a mask, or a transparency mask,<br>and then switch to it, and pay attention that you are painting on the mask not the image.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And as a huge bonus, you are not limited to black or white,<br>you can also use gray, this can be very useful, for fluffy-puffy tails for example.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In closing, when using a collage as a digital under-painting,<br>you never get lost, and you can fix all the things that don't seem to fit quite right.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Combined with layer management where pants, shirt, hair are always on unique layers,<br>you get to make final touches that only impact specific objects in your painting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Using digital photos from sites that have liberal license like <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a> or <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>,<br>can quickly get you started, and make even your most complex works less challenging, and more and beautiful.</div>

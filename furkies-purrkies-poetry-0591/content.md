First, get some rest,
because this is not a test.

And go on an adventure somewhere,
bring a notepad and prepare.

Find a nice coffee shop in the middle of some busy town,
open your notebook, and write it all down.

---

Always search for the re-donkey-lous and funny,
and always go on a walk especially when it's sunny.

Keep a close eye, on funny things,
as they will put true joy into your writings.

Transport your readers into your funny place,
and make sure they can't keep a straight face.

---

And there is something else you should keep in mind too,
deep down, all those beautiful stories, are really about you.

A Funny, Travel and Adventure Writer to be precise,
you write; as you travel from paradise to paradise.

In search of no less, than funny things,
that you share with the world to give your readers wings.

Learn from Bill Bryson, and maybe J. Maarten Troost,
before you know it you'll have ten books written and produced.

Remember to narrate them with your own voice,
you don't really have a choice.

It is your heart that creates the joyful tales,
and your own voice can only increase your sales.

Travel, travel a lot, though it need not be far,
just visiting nearby cities is enough to make you a star.

But try museums, galleries, sports events, and even the zoo,
it won't take you long to find the next funny hullabaloo.

Your readers will be from all over the word,
you'll be sharing your observations and giggles with young and old.

---

In a way it is like you are the press,
slowly going from place to place making progress.

Don't bother assembling any book in particular at first,
it is not a thing that needs to be nursed.

Books are just collections of chapters or stories,
divided into different categories.

---

Avoid being serious, and avoid sarcasm at all cost,
make your happy books a lighthouse for all those who are lost.

Making someone cheerful is an incredible superpower,
you can change lives with stories that you wrote in less than an hour.

Be it visiting all your nearby towns, or distant lands,
joy and humor is something everyone loves and understands.

---

Describing funny observations is a beautiful form of art,
that relies on the beauty of your heart.

Armed with fancy journal and a smOoOth writing pen,
you are sure to create silly stories time and again.

May you fill the whole world with joy and cheer,
may you become as celebrated as Shakespeare.

We must all take to art,
do not wait too long to start.

---

But before you get started,
know that the world of art is completely uncharted.

The only rules that people make,
are for their own sake.

People that lie about being smart,
will try to push you away from art.

---

When you enter the art scene,
bring an image projector and use your canvas as a screen.

Project an image that you like,
and make your version more dreamlike.

---

Remember to use a canvas that you can move,
and start with something cheap to get into the groove.

A light 4x8ft sanded [plywood panel][1] can go a long way,
you can paint it and repaint it all day.

Once a gallery wishes to display your works,
you may get it framed for free - one of the perks.

So don't paint near the edge, as it will get scratched,
and maybe sometimes cracked or detached.

But do treat your panels and canvas with a primer,
in no time you'll be painting like an old timer.

If you wish to clear your canvas and take a new route,
sand down the paint that sticks out.

---

This is your kingdom of art,
and you have to pick where to start.

Art is both a way to live,
and a way with which you can give.

With a projector proportions will always come out great,
in no time you will be ready to paint.

Mixing colors is an another kind of art,
take small steps and use your heart.

And finally, when you creation,
speaks with contrast and saturation.

You must rise above your source image or trace,
you should even go past the smile on a face.

You manually apply photo filters that only a wise artist can,
that should always be the final step in your plan.

---

A photo does not make a perfect portrait, at all,
unless you are taking a picture of a wall.

A photo only captures the proportions and shadows,
to do a person justice, only an artist can come close.

Because a machine cannot know,
when eyes shine or the face has a glow.

A photo only takes a short peek,
but people are as complex as unique.

The full and true reason why we need art,
is because a photos cannot really capture the best part.

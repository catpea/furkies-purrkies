  <p>We must all take to art,<br>do not wait too long to start.</p>

  <p>But before you get started,<br>know that the world of art is completely uncharted.</p>
  <p>The only rules that people make,<br>are for their own sake.</p>
  <p>People that lie about being smart,<br>will try to push you away from art.</p>

  <p>When you enter the art scene,<br>bring an image projector and use your canvas as a screen.</p>
  <p>Project an image that you like,<br>and make your version more dreamlike.</p>

  <p>Remember to use a canvas that you can move,<br>and start with something cheap to get into the groove.</p>
  <p>A light 4x8ft sanded <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Sanded-Plywood-Common-11-32-in-x-2-ft-x-4-ft-Actual-0-322-in-x-23-75-in-x-47-75-in-300853/202093831">plywood panel</a> can go a long way,<br>you can paint it and repaint it all day.</p>
  <p>Once a gallery wishes to display your works,<br>you may get it framed for free - one of the perks.</p>
  <p>So don't paint near the edge, as it will get scratched,<br>and maybe sometimes cracked or detached.</p>
  <p>But do treat your panels and canvas with a primer,<br>in no time you'll be painting like an old timer.</p>
  <p>If you wish to clear your canvas and take a new route,<br>sand down the paint that sticks out.</p>

  <p>This is your kingdom of art,<br>and you have to pick where to start.</p>
  <p>Art is both a way to live,<br>and a way with which you can give.</p>
  <p>With a projector proportions will always come out great,<br>in no time you will be ready to paint.</p>
  <p>Mixing colors is an another kind of art,<br>take small steps and use your heart.</p>
  <p>And finally, when you creation,<br>speaks with contrast and saturation.</p>
  <p>You must rise above your source image or trace,<br>you should even go past the smile on a face.</p>
  <p>You manually apply photo filters that only a wise artist can,<br>that should always be the final step in your plan.</p>

  <p>A photo does not make a perfect portrait, at all,<br>unless you are taking a picture of a wall.</p>
  <p>A photo only captures the proportions and shadows,<br>to do a person justice, only an artist can come close.</p>
  <p>Because a machine cannot know,<br>when eyes shine or the face has a glow.</p>
  <p>A photo only takes a short peek,<br>but people are as complex as unique.</p>
  <p>The full and true reason why we need art,<br>is because a photos cannot really capture the best part.</p>

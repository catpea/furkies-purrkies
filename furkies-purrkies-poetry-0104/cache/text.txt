Authenticity would be Wonderful on its own,
it helps with trust, admiration, knowing, feeling.
But, actually, it is far more than that,
it reflects Fundamental Principles of The Universe.
There is a very big difference, between crossing a real bridge,
and a fake one.
Or, reading a book for real, and pretending to read.
Or, studying a Field of Science and, and cramming for a test.
Or, doing something for a grade, and doing something for your mind.
Or, doing something for real, and pretend to do something.
Or, being your complete self, and being what others approve of.
The one thing in common here, is one is a fantasy that ends,
and the other, just is ... and grows, and alters the course of life ahead.
It is a testament to our connection with the Universe,
that an Authentic Human Being will grow Healthy and Strong, and Keep Expanding.
The best example of this is getting an education that looks great on paper,
but does nothing for interacting with the real word.
A similar example has to do with a great job that pays well, that goes great,
but halts a person's development, and robs them of their youth, dreams, and hopes,
robs them of the highest version of themselves.
Time, cannot be warped, or faked,
it ticks away, our bodies grow, day by day, year by year, decade by decade.
The long-vision of becoming of ourselves, will reveal that the first and foremost,
and most dominant and meaningful thing, is our acquisition of wisdom.
Acquisition of Wisdom is deeply connected to Authenticity,
Courage, Dignity, Nobility, Pursuit of Knowledge, Rising, Growing Up.
Time helps our bodies progress forward,
but it is Wisdom that helps our Minds.
Authenticity, gives us this incredible power to start something today,
that will make us Wiser, Healthier, Happier, Filled with More Insight.
And not merely tomorrow, but for all our time to come,
as in Authenticity, each day adds to the previous.

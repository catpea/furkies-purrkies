  "text": "It has been happening slowly for a hundred years,\neven though people are not taught to become Great Beings.\nMistakes, especially the ones that make us feel foolish,\nopen out minds for rapid self education.\nIt used to be harder to learn,\nnow we have Audiobooks and video lectures.\n\nIt is a very big difference between finding Thoreau's Walden,\nand having a Writer or a Professor take you on a tour of modern philosophy.\nI think the ability to pause a lecture or an audio book is amazing,\nI paused as often to stop and think as I used to pause to cry.\n\nMy Dear Friends,\nI speak of Great Beings,\nbecause I was moved, by Great Beings.\nAnd all my Heart and Love tells me,\nthat the most important lesson I can share with You,\nIs that for all the goodness You do;\nYou must become, a Great Being too.\n\nI used to drive around listening to Audiobooks,\nI went down to Florida during Michigan Winter.\nI set my Audio Books aside, and turned on the radio for a bit,\nI only heard two words, it was the third Monday of January.\n\"Content of Character\"\nI turned the radio down, goodness, once my eyes dried,\nI knew that the Soul had no limit, and that it was meant to hold Wisdom.\nThat's how Philosophers were growing in Greatness,\nKnowledge begot Wisdom, and Wisdom begot Greatness.\nMartin Luther King Jr. is his name and it will never be forgotten,\nhis words are a permanent invitation to Greatness.\n\nI enjoyed practicing driving on North Territorial Road between Canton and Ann Arbor,\nand on a late Autumn evening with trees dressed in beautiful colors a lecture was playing in the background.\nAll of a sudden my mind snapped to attention,\nmy mind became as sharp as a razor blade, and I could not believe the gravity and beauty of what I was hearing.\n\"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,\nto front only the essential facts of life,\nand see if I could not learn what it had to teach,\nand not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\nI did not wish to live what was not life,\nliving is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation,\nunless it was quite necessary.\nI wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,\nto live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,\nto cut a broad swath and shave close,\nto drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms...\"\nI hit the pause button on my Audio Player,\nI had tears in my eyes but didn't cry.\nEver since that one fun time when we watched Ferris Bueller's Day Off in my first year of Highschool,\nas part of learning English and good film making, I remembered:\nFerris Bueller saying \"Life moves pretty fast.

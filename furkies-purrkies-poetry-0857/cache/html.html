  <p>While painting, programming, composing, writing, rhyming, singing, sculpting,<br>building and inventing, all represents real knowledge.</p>
  <p>It is not just a bag of random random goodies,<br>because they all connect, and reinforce one another.</p>
  <p>For example, in 3D Modeling we have the concept of the vertex, edge and face,<br>and it would be near impossible to create 3D things without it.</p>
  <p>This influences user interface design, in programming,<br>because those three things are really hard to grasp at first.</p>
  <p>And normally when programming a User Interface for your program,<br>you wouldn't even dare to introduce such complexity.</p>
  <p>But now, knowing that this is what makes 3D modeling successful,<br>you are granted permission to expand your user interface.</p>
  <p>Depending on your program, possibly even into high complexity,<br>that the vertex, edge and face so neatly demonstrates.</p>

  <p>It is not the scientist, that master of that trade,<br>that is a good example of a well educated person.</p>
  <p>The Hacker is a good example of a well educated person,<br>so as long as they don’t forget to take good care of themselves too.</p>
  <p>A hacker, somewhat similar to that old Gad Fly, Socrates,<br>may say they know next to nothing.</p>
  <p>That things are not their area of expertise,<br>but more than often they have long surpassed the experts in the field.</p>
  <p>It is just that the field is so large,<br>that compared to the field it self their knowledge seems small to them.</p>
  <p>And by Hacker I don’t mean the troublemakers who will by an expensive vaccum cleaner robot,<br>install remote control, a camera, and some other equipment, and then return it.</p>
  <p>Waiting for a person with a large budget to buy and deploy that unit,<br>in their own home, this probably happens to a lot of electronics that can be returned.</p>
  <p>I mean <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhyM-bhzFsI">the Hacker that will buy the unit, to study the code, and alert the company</a>,<br>hopefully with the attorney on the other line, in exchange for an enormous reward.</p>

  <p>Note how this is not a vacuum hacker, but rather someone who deep down,<br>may dream about having their own robot, lyke in the movies.</p>
  <p>Or at the very least for their sftp server to follow them around,<br>and why the heck not?</p>

  <p>A Powerful Hacker is not elevated by any one thing,<br>nor do they switch hats from electronics to operating systems, or, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fEMJp70tGU">advanced art</a> even.</p>
  <p>If they could only be one thing at a time,<br>it would be the a great tragedy.</p>
  <p>And they aren't even a sum of what they know,<br>because knowledge grows, and no human could ever stop themselves from learning by subtle analogy.</p>
  <p>So all the functional things, that we actually comprehend,<br>that we can employ and enjoy, are constantly cross connecting..</p>
  <p>And even more so,<br>when we are stressed for inventing new things.</p>
  <p>I mean the first thing you do when you want to create, is to cross the streams,<br>in the deepest of our creativity we yearn for nothing more than the pandemonium of ideas.</p>

  <p>So schools, when they teach us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEnnvZbYek">pre-chewed and tasteless</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">disconnected</a>,<br>and make us parade for worthless grades...</p>
  <p>Are really hurting our minds,<br>and by extension the world, and the future of human kind.</p>
  <p>Because their is no greater tragedy, and no deeper sadness,<br>than a young mind, unable to cross the streams.</p>
  <p>We have to fix schools,<br>we have to make them worthy of the best of us.</p>
  <p>No more standardized education, no more grades, no more unforgivable student loans,<br>no more punishment, ridicule, no more holding brilliant mind a year back.</p>
  <p>At the very least, make sure that all the people you know, understand,<br>that to grow up, means to grow all the way up, until we all become Great Beings.</p>

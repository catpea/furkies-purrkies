    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not just a bag of random random goodies,<br>because they all connect, and reinforce one another.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example, in 3D Modeling we have the concept of the vertex, edge and face,<br>and it would be near impossible to create 3D things without it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This influences user interface design, in programming,<br>because those three things are really hard to grasp at first.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And normally when programming a User Interface for your program,<br>you wouldn't even dare to introduce such complexity.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But now, knowing that this is what makes 3D modeling successful,<br>you are granted permission to expand your user interface.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Depending on your program, possibly even into high complexity,<br>that the vertex, edge and face so neatly demonstrates.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The Hacker is a good example of a well educated person,<br>so as long as they don’t forget to take good care of themselves too.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A hacker, somewhat similar to that old Gad Fly, Socrates,<br>may say they know next to nothing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That things are not their area of expertise,<br>but more than often they have long surpassed the experts in the field.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is just that the field is so large,<br>that compared to the field it self their knowledge seems small to them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And by Hacker I don’t mean the troublemakers who will by an expensive vaccum cleaner robot,<br>install remote control, a camera, and some other equipment, and then return it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Waiting for a person with a large budget to buy and deploy that unit,<br>in their own home, this probably happens to a lot of electronics that can be returned.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I mean <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhyM-bhzFsI">the Hacker that will buy the unit, to study the code, and alert the company</a>,<br>hopefully with the attorney on the other line, in exchange for an enormous reward.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So all the functional things, that we actually comprehend,<br>that we can employ and enjoy, are constantly cross connecting..</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I mean the first thing you do when you want to create, is to cross the streams,<br>in the deepest of our creativity we yearn for nothing more than the pandemonium of ideas.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">No more standardized education, no more grades, no more unforgivable student loans,<br>no more punishment, ridicule, no more holding brilliant mind a year back.</div>

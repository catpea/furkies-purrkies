  <p>If I know anything about Summer,<br>this year it will rear it self like a plumber.</p>
  <p>She'll moon us with the heat of night,<br>and I'll bet the moon will be twice as bright.</p>

  <p>Already the ducks are quacking,<br>and squires dug their nuts up are busy cracking.</p>
  <p>Geese arrived a month ago,<br>they're hissing like they are ready to blow.</p>
  <p>That is a sign, surely,<br>it shows that summer will arrive a whole month early.</p>
  <p>It is like 62 days to summer meow,<br>and it will probably arrive even sooner somehow.</p>

  <p>Personally, I recommend riding a bicycle to all,<br>get a soft, comfy-wide seat, and have a ball.</p>
  <p>There is always bicycle trail, or park, somewhere near,<br>so you can safely ride without any fear.</p>
  <p>It is a great excuse to take plenty of selfless,<br>cheese!</p>

  <p>It happens every century or so,<br>Humanity grabs a bunch of meat and coal and gets ready to go.</p>
  <p>Somehow we remember all the lost and lonely grills,<br>now bespidered in the nearby parks or on distant hills.</p>
  <p>Convince all the vegans and vegetarians to come too,<br>because no BBQ is complete without marshmallows, corn, and vegetable stew.</p>
  <p>We grab a radio and a blanket,<br>and crank it.</p>

If I know anything about Summer,
this year it will rear it self like a plumber.
She'll moon us with the heat of night,
and I'll bet the moon will be twice as bright.

Already the ducks are quacking,
and squires dug their nuts up are busy cracking.
Geese arrived a month ago,
they're hissing like they are ready to blow.
That is a sign, surely,
it shows that summer will arrive a whole month early.
It is like 62 days to summer meow,
and it will probably arrive even sooner somehow.

Personally, I recommend riding a bicycle to all,
get a soft, comfy-wide seat, and have a ball.
There is always bicycle trail, or park, somewhere near,
so you can safely ride without any fear.
It is a great excuse to take plenty of selfless,
cheese!

More than that, Astrologers; and Astronomers even,
depending, which one you believe in...
Have long sung of the summer of 22,
and it has been named as the Summer of BBQ.

It happens every century or so,
Humanity grabs a bunch of meat and coal and gets ready to go.
Somehow we remember all the lost and lonely grills,
now bespidered in the nearby parks or on distant hills.
Convince all the vegans and vegetarians to come too,
because no BBQ is complete without marshmallows, corn, and vegetable stew.
We grab a radio and a blanket,
and crank it.

When all your ideas are beginning to flow,
and you create, as you go.

When carried upon creativity's wings,
and synthesizing new things.

And when you are glad,
to remember to carry a notepad.

---

When you rise too all the challenges,
no matter what the challenge is.

When you avoid getting get into fights,
or just wait for the cops to read them their rights.

And when you want to make the world a nicer place,
and sometimes dream about traveling in deep space.

---

When you carry wise books,
and people give you happy looks.

When you carry a little book of maps,
to check if you are ready for adventure perhaps.

And wen no adventure is too big or small,
because you love it all.

---



When you learn faster than [Johnny 5][1],
by relistening to all the audiobooks on your hard drive.

When you use all your paper scraps,
to doodle beautiful [mind maps][2].

And when you own many a [memory palace][3],
lit by your own aurora borealis.

---

[When you understand you are a genius][4] and [aim to be a polymath][5],
as ravenous as nature's wrath.

And when you love looking at stars,
and connecting all the dots in your memoirs.

Then you are a student of the ancient art of seeing,
you are a Philosopher, on your way to become a Great Being.

---

And if you are just beginning right meow,
then to you, I bow.

Soon you will walk [adventure trails][6] kicking up ancient dust,
as the first step is to ignite your wanderlust.

---

And do not wait for Spring,
to make your crossing.

Start now, set your sail,
or pick your trail.

---

But remember to [start short][7],
as adventure is for wisdom and not  sport.

And don't go alone,
share each and every milestone.

---

Your elderself want you to quickly become wise,
as greatness, is the prize.

Your books are waiting to be written,
and your readers are waiting to be smitten.

And just so that you know,
the aim is to help the world grow.

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Learning Programming maybe... probably better for you,<br>than learning the intricate rules of some boring sport, and learning portrait drawing may be better still.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The only difference between something easy and something more difficult<br>is the angle of the on-ramp.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If we are growing up among athletes,<br>we learn about sports by listening to their conversations.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And as a result it is not very hard to start,<br>and it is not hard to learn more.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In my case, I never had to go to driving school,<br>because I was frequently paying attention to what the heck the drivers were doing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I don’t recommend learning this way, because as a young person you have the unique opportunity to freak out your driving instructor with a <a href="https://youtu.be/WaAu4L2cl4c?t=29">surprise donut</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">...and quietly say,<br>“Whoops.”</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Come to think of it, don’t do that either,<br>find your own way.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In my case, the only thing I missed, was the intersection scenario,<br>where the one who is making a turn left in the turning lane...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">...has to wait for the all the slowpokes to pass first,<br>which is redonkeylous - but what-ev.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I once cut everyone off while fetching a pizza order for a coffee shop,<br>the passenger who volunteered to help me load all the boxes, skequed, and said:</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">“Dude, I can’t believe you just did this!”,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I looked at him, with what I imagine was a really cool<br>“what you wait me to wait for the geriatrics too” expression.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But actually since I didn’t know this rule,<br>I was only giving him a slightly annoyed expression for calling me Dude.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What he didn’t know, was that I didn’t know I did something wrong,<br>because this was lyke, my third time driving a freaking car.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I like blooming late,<br>as that gives me time to bloom well.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I drove to Key West few weeks later<br>it turned out it was just that one thing that I didn’t know.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Actually, two things,<br>as I still owe like a quarter to some pay-per-drive bridge in Florida, I am sorry Florida.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So one of the things we need to pay attention to,<br>is self educational on-ramps.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Their angle, or the difficulty of the new subject,<br>and our initial preparations.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just because you didn’t grow up among programmers,<br>does not mean that learning programming is impossible or even difficult.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When I was learning modern programming after high school,<br>I would search AltaVista for things I was interested in, followed by the world tutorial.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can search for video tutorials now, but you have to add novice, beginner, or introduction,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwFeg0cEZvQ">I found Rock Paper Scissors in JavaScript</a> for you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My first program, the one I was accused of plagiarizing was about Lottery,<br>goodness knows what I put in there to trigger that moron teacher, but I am still so proud.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But you know, right after these initial on-ramps,<br>you can spice things up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For me, the spice was making a window in windows,<br>I made thousands of programs by now, 99.9% were just nonsense that I liked.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time I felt under the weather with seasonal sneezes,<br>and I spent a few days in bed writing a program that planned visits to haunted houses.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When I told the person who came up with the idea that I wrote his program,<br>he stopped talking to me.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because, one he realized I was really computer smart - they didn’t somehow know even though they wanted me to design their website,<br>and two, he was scared he’d have to pay for a program I finished but they were still planning - what an awful weasel.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Anywhooo... you can spice up your on-ramp by making your self education,<br>super creative.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time at a coffee shop I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackThisSite">Hack This Site</a>,<br>and to this day I think of creating a clone of the site, or maybe a game, as one of the best self education ideas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Computer security does come up in programming,<br>especially when learning to write server programs with node.js.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And you’d think it would be supremely intimidating,<br>and certainly a thing to complicate learning programming.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But creating a game about hacking into virtual computers in your game,<br>based on real techniques as listed on <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/">OWASP for example</a> converts security into a fun exercise in creativity.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Programming isn’t the only thing worth learning, I mention it a lot because it pays well and it is what I picked for myself,<br>but I think Art is still by far the most promising path towards lunch money.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The one thing I never mention is that after some months with drawing/painting portraits with a Computer Projector,<br>you learn how to do it freehand.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Whatever the challenge,<br>by accepting it, you will begin learning for real.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And if it is something that does turn out to be worth the time,<br>like Art certainly is, then by sticking with it out of enjoyment, mastery will come sooner than later.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In closing, perhaps one of the biggest surprises about self education is that,<br>it is way easier than fake education which we can’t get good at it is always confusing and noisy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Finding what calls to you, what is fun and enriching,<br>should take a very, very! long time.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Your curiosities, including the path that you take when hopping among them all,<br>are absolutely sacred.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Your noblest pursuits mark your path through knowledge and towards wisdom,<br>and beyond towards Greatness.</div>

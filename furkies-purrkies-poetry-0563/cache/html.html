  <p>On Dignity And Classiness: Preface,</p>
  <p>I must clarify ahead of time, that the word class that I use here,<br>has been misused in history, and as a result has a dark past.</p>
  <p>Alas, we need that word back, we have lost the Noble Knight, we have lost The Gentle Lady and the Gentleman,<br>even the word Officer has lost prestige.</p>
  <p>But the young people need a way to say:<br>"I won't fight you, because you lack class.", they need to be able to say "I am too classy for that, you jerks" and not do something stupid that everybody else did.</p>
  <p>Cornel West whom I feature in this poem, uses the word Ennobled,<br>and I hope that word will return to our daily language.</p>
  <p>Instead of saying "This woman has class",<br>it would be much more beautiful in my opinion to say "This woman is ennobled by her deeds."</p>
  <p>But that is not how we use language today,<br>so we will use the word class here.</p>
  <p>The aim of this poem is not to divide Humanity anymore than it already is,<br>but to help us converge together on wisdom, with Great Class and Dignity.</p>

  <p>On Dignity And Classiness</p>
  <p>Dignity is complicated as it has multiple facets or sides,<br>it means and it is less of a rule and more of an armour.</p>
  <p>Class, starts of as the behaviors you inherited from all that surrounds you,<br>I think frequently this is not enough to progress and grow up.</p>
  <p>And certainly you want to inherit the class of great beings.<br>the class of a citizen of the world.</p>
  <p>Great Beings are people that truly change the world for better,<br>and citizens of the world are those who are not divided by borders, religions or beliefs, but converge together on wisdom.</p>

  <p>Class and Dignity, grows with us, it is dynamic,<br>our minds are doing everything to make sure that we feel whole, but that is not good for those who transform.</p>
  <p>If a person that has undergone a transformation, is still scarred by the past,<br>they are making a mistake, and need help.</p>
  <p>People who are growing up, who are transforming,<br>must frequently ask, if they would still make the mistake they once made...</p>
  <p>If the answer is no,<br>then they are different person from who they once were, and they need to stop blaming themselves.</p>

  <p>See Class and Dignity may sound simple,<br>but actually they reach deeply into a Human Being.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfD3X3f5C_w">Cornel West</a>, in the opening of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examined_Life">Astra Taylor's Examined Life</a>,<br>captures the subject beautifully.</p>
  <p>Mr. West could maybe say that everything we do is a mistake,<br>it is in correcting those mistakes that we find greatness.</p>
  <p>But we will not speak like this,<br>not everyone makes mistakes, and those who do need to check if they have changed, and let themselves be free.</p>

  <p>If we are taught that there is such a thing as Precious Dignity, and Evil Poverty,<br>we will not allow the sickness of poverty take our dignity away, we will not rob, or sell drugs, or worse.</p>
  <p>We will stop and ask, "Who made this poverty?", "Why are we in it?",<br>and we will learn from fools onward to becoming wise.</p>
  <p>Not everyone of us can leap into Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,<br>precisely because they are being held back by poverty, or violence, or crime, or all the other terrible things.</p>
  <p>But having been made aware that we can rise to have more class in life,<br>that we have dignity that others may try to take, in order to turn us into some tool, or make a fool - and that we must protect it.</p>
  <p>Creates a stepping stone,<br>maybe a starting point.</p>

  <p>Here young people can ignore drugs and alcohol and other stupid ideas,<br>understanding that dignity is a treasure, that it is something that their elder selves will appreciate.</p>
  <p>And transcendence of class, be it a class that holds bullies in high esteem, or corrupt politicians,<br>or sees drugs and alcohol as fun, - leaving that behind, is a sure path to more knowledge.</p>
  <p>To improve ones class, is to inherit it from Great Beings that we admire,<br>and that inheritance requires the reading of books, or listening to narrated books from the library.</p>
  <p>Interestingly, at first, it does not always matter what the books are about,<br>it is not so much the content, but the kind of thinking that Great Beings do.</p>
  <p>That is what getting more class is about,<br>spending time among the great beings to understand who they are.</p>
  <p>Once we have the who:<br>the great beings, their companionship, and their class.</p>
  <p>We will be ready for the what,<br>the things they are attempting to share or achieve.</p>

  <p>To think in terms of dignity,<br>is to grant ourselves the opportunity to say no, even to our best friends.</p>
  <p>To say:<br>"No, because my dignity is more important, then some stupid, temporary shit, that the elder me will end up regretting later on.".</p>

  <p>To think in terms of class,<br>is to ask, many questions, and even to begin comprehending that unfortunate people may have their freedom of will taken away,</p>
  <p>"What is the best class?", "How do I get there?",<br>and most importantly "Why was I not born to it?", "What went wrong and where?".</p>
  <p>"Does a person who uses violence have class?",<br>"Are they truly themselves, when they lack class? Class that is their right, that is their inheritance, and treasure, their beauty and prestige.".</p>
  <p>"If they transcended to the class of Great Beings,<br>what would they think of their younger selves?"</p>
  <p>And even the cute and silly question that one may ask themselves in the morning:<br>"Am I Classy?"</p>
  <p>(I can answer that one for you, Yes you are! You are classy!,<br>say it with me: "I am classy, and sassy.")</p>

  <p>In closing, use dignity to draw a line that no one is allowed to cross,<br>and use class as a path towards understanding, towards Knowledge and resulting Wisdom, and onward to Greatness.</p>

  "text": "On Dignity And Classiness: Preface,\nI must clarify ahead of time, that the word class that I use here,\nhas been misused in history, and as a result has a dark past.\nAlas, we need that word back, we have lost the Noble Knight, we have lost The Gentle Lady and the Gentleman,\neven the word Officer has lost prestige.\nBut the young people need a way to say:\n\"I won't fight you, because you lack class.\", they need to be able to say \"I am too classy for that, you jerks\" and not do something stupid that everybody else did.\nCornel West whom I feature in this poem, uses the word Ennobled,\nand I hope that word will return to our daily language.\nInstead of saying \"This woman has class\",\nit would be much more beautiful in my opinion to say \"This woman is ennobled by her deeds.\"\nBut that is not how we use language today,\nso we will use the word class here.\nThe aim of this poem is not to divide Humanity anymore than it already is,\nbut to help us converge together on wisdom, with Great Class and Dignity.\n\nOn Dignity And Classiness\nDignity is complicated as it has multiple facets or sides,\nit means and it is less of a rule and more of an armour.\nClass, starts of as the behaviors you inherited from all that surrounds you,\nI think frequently this is not enough to progress and grow up.\nAnd certainly you want to inherit the class of great beings.\nthe class of a citizen of the world.\nGreat Beings are people that truly change the world for better,\nand citizens of the world are those who are not divided by borders, religions or beliefs, but converge together on wisdom.\n\nClass and Dignity, grows with us, it is dynamic,\nour minds are doing everything to make sure that we feel whole, but that is not good for those who transform.\nIf a person that has undergone a transformation, is still scarred by the past,\nthey are making a mistake, and need help.\nPeople who are growing up, who are transforming,\nmust frequently ask, if they would still make the mistake they once made...\nIf the answer is no,\nthen they are different person from who they once were, and they need to stop blaming themselves.\n\nSee Class and Dignity may sound simple,\nbut actually they reach deeply into a Human Being.\nCornel West[1], in the opening of Astra Taylor's Examined Life[2],\ncaptures the subject beautifully.\nMr. West could maybe say that everything we do is a mistake,\nit is in correcting those mistakes that we find greatness.\nBut we will not speak like this,\nnot everyone makes mistakes, and those who do need to check if they have changed, and let themselves be free.\n\nIf we are taught that there is such a thing as Precious Dignity, and Evil Poverty,\nwe will not allow the sickness of poverty take our dignity away, we will not rob, or sell drugs, or worse.\nWe will stop and ask, \"Who made this poverty?\", \"Why are we in it?\",\nand we will learn from fools onward to becoming wise.\nNot everyone of us can leap into Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,\nprecisely because they are being held back by poverty, or violence, or crime, or all the other terrible things.\nBut having been made aware that we can rise to have more class in life,\nthat we have dignity that others may try to take, in order to turn us into some tool, or make a fool - and that we must protect it.\nCreates a stepping stone,\nmaybe a starting point.\n\nHere young people can ignore drugs and alcohol and other stupid ideas,\nunderstanding that dignity is a treasure, that it is something that their elder selves will appreciate.\nAnd transcendence of class, be it a class that holds bullies in high esteem, or corrupt politicians,\nor sees drugs and alcohol as fun, - leaving that behind, is a sure path to more knowledge.\nTo improve ones class, is to inherit it from Great Beings that we admire,\nand that inheritance requires the reading of books, or listening to narrated books from the library.\nInterestingly, at first, it does not always matter what the books are about,\nit is not so much the content, but the kind of thinking that Great Beings do.\nThat is what getting more class is about,\nspending time among the great beings to understand who they are.\nOnce we have the who:\nthe great beings, their companionship, and their class.\nWe will be ready for the what,\nthe things they are attempting to share or achieve.\n\nTo think in terms of dignity,\nis to grant ourselves the opportunity to say no, even to our best friends.\nTo say:\n\"No, because my dignity is more important, then some stupid, temporary shit, that the elder me will end up regretting later on.\".\n\nTo think in terms of class,\nis to ask, many questions, and even to begin comprehending that unfortunate people may have their freedom of will taken away,\n\"What is the best class?\", \"How do I get there?\",\nand most importantly \"Why was I not born to it?\", \"What went wrong and where?\".\n\"Does a person who uses violence have class?\",\n\"Are they truly themselves, when they lack class? Class that is their right, that is their inheritance, and treasure, their beauty and prestige.\".\n\"If they transcended to the class of Great Beings,\nwhat would they think of their younger selves?\"\nAnd even the cute and silly question that one may ask themselves in the morning:\n\"Am I Classy?\"\n(I can answer that one for you, Yes you are! You are classy!,\nsay it with me: \"I am classy, and sassy.\")\n\nIn closing, use dignity to draw a line that no one is allowed to cross,\nand use class as a path towards understanding, towards Knowledge and resulting Wisdom, and onward to Greatness.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfD3X3f5C_w\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examined_Life",

You are far too magnificent,
to dabble in the easy things.

The days of our lives are too precious,
and each one is a rare as they come.

School, College, Diploma, Job and Career,
are too easy for you.

It is the silk road, for all those waiting to make money
of all the simple people searching for simple dreams.

Our bodies and minds are as delicate as beautiful,
and not a day should be wasted on carrots on sticks.

Every one of your steps must be aimed towards greatness,
and pave your path with Adventure, Knowledge, and Wisdom.

Be mindful of your Elder Self,
help her stand Wise, Fearless, Strong, and Beautiful.

Do not compromise on the heights you aim to reach,
calmly walk forward step by step.

Let all you steps add together,
to add to who you are, and where you are headed.

Aim to triumph,
in ways that few others can.

We each walk a unique road,
that none walked before.

Know that no human has ever aged,
we each amplify.

We amplify, how we live,
and who we are.

We amplify in the direction we are headed,
and who we will become upon our arrival.

Nothing is ever subtracted, or lost,
time and age, can only add, and offer new turns.

A new challenge awaits behind every corner,
a new wisdom soon to be discovered near by.

Before we know it,
to pen a book worth keeping takes a week.

To inspire,
takes but a single sentence.

And to heal the world,
this requires your unique brilliant mind.

As to what it is all for?

For making all the heights of our journey count for even more,
as we ignite the hearts of others.

To help them grow,
and to lift them when they fall.

It is a poor person in deed,
one who starts at the very bottom.

But it makes a world of difference to,
to speak with a Being who can lift you with a lifetime of wisdom.

It is all for wisdom and for helping others start,
at the highest of heights that we ourselves reach.

Letting them carry on,
on top of the the wisdom you found.

No child should ever start at the beginning,
that was already had before.

For that is a journey,
that has already occurred.

Every step of the unique path we walk,
add us to create a better start for someone.

All it takes to lift a person,
is the sharing of our wisdom.

No greater power,
could possibly exist in our universe.

Then that of lifting one mind,
to the height of another.

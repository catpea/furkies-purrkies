Everybody knows the world needs help
everybody waits for someone else
Everybody knows the schools are broken
everybody knows the grades are fake
Everybody knows the teacher lies
the good students lose and liars win
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

Everybody knows animals need help
Everybody knows the research is real
Everybody feels something's coming
Then they do as little as they can
All the students listen to their teachers
but the fake diploma's garbage now
And a long-stem rose - then they close their minds
then they close their minds

Everybody knows that we are one family
everybody knows that prison's torture
everybody knows that we need wisdom
to make our way to greatness now
Everybody knows that we are hurting
but there are just too many worthless things to do
for no reason at all
for no reason at all

Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
That's how it goes
Everybody knows

And nobody knows that it's now or never
nobody knows we can stop the change
you will know earth-will change forever
if you ask the future you.
everybody knows that war is evil
we send children to die for naught
For some stars and stripes,
And everybody knows

And everybody knew pandemics were coming,
everybody new it would spread fast
everybody knew that the emperors were naked
that good politics can't last
everybody knows we need real change
but poverty is choking the world dead
and it can't breathe
he's calling to his mother

And everybody knows that prisons must close
there was no vote to keep them open
We must end poverty right now
to have a chance at peace
everybody knows the world will change
the children will never forgive us for this
fix the world
the children will know

  <p>None of the horrible things that occurred,<br>occurred by deliberate and careful design.</p>
  <p>Almost all the bad things occurred by chance,<br>by chaos, complexity, and accident.</p>

  <p>The evil soldiers that we hear of,<br>are not born this way.</p>
  <p>They are manufactured,<br>also not entirely by design.</p>
  <p>But rather by attrition,<br>extreme poverty fractures weak and uneducated men.</p>
  <p>And under the threat of death,<br>they will do evil things.</p>
  <p>But it is not in their genes,<br>they are broken by extreme poverty.</p>

  <p>We need a school that will bring light to all the darkness,<br>so that liars have nowhere to hide.</p>

  <p>It is just audio,<br>and it fits snugly in the ear.</p>

  <p>And answering, who we are, what Humanity is,<br>showing that we are one family.</p>
  <p>That we are just divided by random chance,<br>by mistakes, by uneducated men and histories of hate.</p>
  <p>Showing that we are one,<br>but also that we must prevent those in need from becoming fractured.</p>

  <p>You are not allowed,<br>to lose faith in Humanity.</p>
  <p>Because we need your help,<br>we need your wisdom.</p>
  <p>Gather all the aches and pains,<br>and become unbreakable.</p>
  <p>Because if you let them crush you,<br>then all the suffering was for naught.</p>
  <p>But if you use it to create armor,<br>and become a Great Being.</p>
  <p>Then not only,<br>will you grant meaning to your aches and pains.</p>
  <p>But to all the other,<br>aches and pains, and tragedies also.</p>
  <p>No longer will they be forgotten,<br>with our passing.</p>
  <p>Now they will be written,<br>into the history of Human kind...</p>
  <p>By all the wisdom goodness,<br>you will bring into existence.</p>
  <p>Do not lose faith in the Humanity,<br>the world needs your help.</p>
  <p>Please,<br>become a Great Being.</p>

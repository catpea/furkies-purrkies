  "text": "Hey,\nTeacher.\n\nA lot of the students somehow know...\n- and they are watching you.\n\nThey are learning from you,\nwhat not to become.\n\nMost teachers will copy other teacher's grades,\neven when classes are not related.\n\nTo them a C student,\nis a C student in their class too.\n\nSo a C in English,\nwill make a C student in Spanish, maybe in Math, and probably in Art too.\n\nThis is called \"I hate my job\",\nthis is called incompetence.\n\nTeaching is not a job, painting is a job, maintenance is a job,\nteaching is about propagation of the best of culture.\n\nTo fail to teach,\nis to fail an entire generation.\n\nTo fail a generation,\nis to have them repeat mistakes, and force them to make new ones.\n\nA failed culture is a cult,\nit is a temporary thing swiftly moving towards the brick wall of reality.\n\nIt won't just be about torture like enhanced-interrogation,\nor concentration camps like cramped government-detention facilities that separate children from mothers,\nand it won't stop at what has been called vocational facilities.\n\nTo fail a generation,\nis to restart them at zero, and have them repeat every horrible mistake.\n\nTeaching is not a job,\nis all we have.\n\nTeaching is all we have.\n\nTeaching. is. all. we. have.\n\nTeaching is all we have.\n\nTeaching is all we have.\n\nSchools that use grades,\ncause harm.\n\nTeachers that blindly follow the broken practice,\nmisunderstood the meaning of education.\n\nChildren with bad grades,\nwill use them as a measure of self.\n\nCurriculum based education causes harm,\nteachers often scare their students into memorization, which is meaningless and temporary.\n\nMaybe not completely meaningless,\nbecause by a very long extension that the teachers themselves won't grasp in their shallow thinking and ignorance, the teachers cause great harm.\n\nThey set the students up,\nfor complete failure.\n\nA good programmer kid,\nwill not get an A in programming when they are flunking math.\n\nAnd they will be flunking Math, because unlike Programming which is a rational chain of functions,\nmath teachers in their sick incompetence will frighten their students into brainless memorization.\n\nProgramming is a superset of math, think of programming as a thing that wraps math,\nschool math is tiny compared to software.\n\nBad teachers have no grasp on fundamentals, and in some cases reality even,\nthey only know enough to bring a paycheck home, and sadly, that is more than enough to destroy minds.\n\nThere is no argument to save the face of bad teachers,\nbecause of the harm their misunderstanding, has caused - they are the men that sold the world.\n\nHomeschooling will only make things worse,\nit will cut students off from modern culture.\n\nHomeschooling is likely to make students more susceptible to lies and manipulations,\nand their eventual start in life will be worse for it.\n\nAn education,\nis not supposed to be something that starts when a student goes to school.\n\nThat kind of education,\nis the least and the worst.\n\nWhat a child, or student needs,\nis a Culture of Knowledge.\n\n\n[enhanced-interrogation]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LPubUCJv58\n[cramped government-detention facilities that separate children from mothers]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Jq-V4qvZh8\n[vocational facilities]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7RojQpJWMw\n[Curriculum based education causes harm]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY\n[school math is tiny compared to software]: https://github.com/catpea/math-as-code",

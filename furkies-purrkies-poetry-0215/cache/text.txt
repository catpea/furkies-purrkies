I have searched for great beings,
because I wanted to learn about life.
And I found them,
they are not even rare.
Many are outspoken,
and all over the internet.

Though, far greater in person,
than they show to the public.
They walk among us,
quiet and collected, wise and inspired.

And I wish they could live forever,
because that's what our world needs.
But they are not going to be around forever,
and they don't want anything that we can give them.

Except for one thing,
us becoming great beings too.

My Friends, as wonderful and powerful as Wisdom is,
Greatness, Greatness, is what the world needs.

We have to stop accepting things,
just because we were born into them.
We have to stop being lead,
and become leaders.

You wan to know what The Meaning of Life Is,
well let me tell you.

The meaning of your life,
is to become a Great Being.

Everyone of us,
a Great Being.
That is the mistake we made,
we thought that greatness is rare.
But greatness,
is what the world needs of us to grow.

Take to the Books,
take to the audio books (they can't be easier, and adventure books are breathtaking),
maybe, narrate the classics, and share with the Little Ones.
Avoid everything that is trying to teach you outside-in,
and reach out to learn, to really, really learn, inside-out.
Don't memorize, don't seek grades,
just inherit wisdom from a hundred audio books,
and then listen to nine-hundred more, just to be sure.

Let us inherit wisdom from Humanity's most loved modern audio books,
and let us fill ourselves with knowledge from a thousand lives,
knowledge will grant us wisdom,
and then let us rise and become leaders.
Leadership and Wisdom,
will drive us forward,
to become Great Beings.
Let us do this,
not for Heroes but for Humanity and the future,
for each other.
The world will only become better,
when each of us, accepts the responsibility for becoming a Great Being.

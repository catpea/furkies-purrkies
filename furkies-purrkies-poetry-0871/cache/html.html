  <p>You can't just learn one thing,<br>that's impossible.</p>
  <p>Not only is everything connected,<br>you will connect it in a unique way.</p>
  <p>People say that Newton,<br>had this powerful learning method.</p>
  <p>But,<br>he didn't.</p>
  <p>It looked difficult and powerful to strangers,<br>but in his mind...</p>
  <p>He wasn't even merely following his curiosities,<br>he was just having fun.</p>

  <p>Real education,<br>is about having fun.</p>
  <p>In fact,<br>jack of all trades and a master of none.</p>
  <p>Is an uneducated and jealous person's description,<br>of someone who is spiraling upwards in self education.</p>
  <p>I think it is true for all that,<br>that nobody sticks with a subject for long.</p>
  <p>Because some weeks into it,<br>they will begin missing some other talent.</p>

  <p>For example a person programming may miss art,<br>and a painter may miss composing music after a while.</p>
  <p>There comes a point is ready to switch,<br>and they do, and they continue having fun.</p>
  <p>T o someone shallow that will seem like failure,<br>but it is actually like a growth spur.</p>
  <p>When a self educated person switches subject,<br>they don't just resume where they left off.</p>
  <p>They approach the subject they were longing for,<br>on a whole new level.</p>

  <p>You can see how different this is,<br>from standardized schools.</p>
  <p>Standardized education,<br>is an uneducated person's idea of education.</p>
  <p>They send you through steps,<br>and you come out smarter.</p>
  <p>The truth is you were smarter all along,<br>but they just wasted years of your life.</p>
  <p>In most cases,<br>they tricked people out of real education.</p>
  <p>The students that graduate with more knowledge,<br>know more, not because they received an education.</p>
  <p>But because they allowed the teachers,<br>to force them into learning.</p>
  <p>For praise, good grades,<br>promise of some career.</p>
  <p>But it was the worst kind of learning,<br>out of sequence, all cut up, and void of joy.</p>

  <p>Standardized education is like telling an artist,<br>when to paint, what to paint, and when to finish.</p>
  <p>And under the threat of prison, and ridicule,<br>of being held back one year, and permanently marked as delayed.</p>
  <p>Teachers pretending to teach to get paychecks, and Students pretending to learn by memorizing to get out of there,<br>and because education is what separates us from cavemen, or war and slavery.</p>
  <p>Fake or ineffective education is as dangerous as ignoring climate change,<br>or watching population grow by 7 billion in the span of a single lifetime.</p>

  <p>But let's set dark imaginings aside,<br>you are as brilliant and as capable as any genius.</p>
  <p>Above all you are a Citizen Of The World,<br>and you belong to no nation, or cult.</p>
  <p>Go to the library, find your first audio book... if you haven't already,<br>maybe Bill Bryson, or Randall Munroe, Carl Sagan or Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
  <p>Begin your upward cycle of self education,<br>and go all the way up - until you become a great being.</p>

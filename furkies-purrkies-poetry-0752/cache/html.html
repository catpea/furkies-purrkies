  <p>There are three important points in today's fast paced world of art,<br>question the teachers, embrace using reference images over full canvas, and make use of 3D models.</p>

  <p>One, on the subject of teachers, I will say that Art does not need computers,<br>and a good artist can still perfectly capture a person's appearance.</p>
  <p>It is cruel to throw logs at the student's feet,<br>especially those who are new to art.</p>
  <p>They are being purposefully and artificially delayed,<br>with concepts like hand-eye-coordination, and the promise of art is never fulfilled at graduation anyway.</p>
  <p>We are all artists, and we should all start with realistic portraits,<br>from there everyone will find a different calling.</p>

  <p>Two, we must ask what is better, a fanciful painting of an imaginary face,<br>or the perfect painting of a real person.</p>
  <p>A real person will smile,<br>and truly appreciate the work.</p>
  <p>And imaginary faces,<br>are trivial to generate on a computer.</p>
  <p>By extension,<br>can we paint a face free hand, with a line model, or even with a grid...</p>
  <p>Given that a high resolution digital painting hay hold 10 to 20 intricate details,<br>in the nose a alone.</p>
  <p>A keepsake holds a snapshot of a person,<br>but without any of the burdens of a photo, and with all benefits of art.</p>
  <p>That means, the eyes, the eyebrows, the lips, the nose,<br>must be exactly right, as that is the foundation of the portrait.</p>
  <p>Everything else can be a dream,<br>but the face must be true.</p>
  <p>Because in 50 years the person in the portrait will look back at their younger self,<br>and they they will recognize their youthful nose, and all features of the face.</p>
  <p>They will contemplate their history,<br>and daydream through all their adventures.</p>
  <p>A photo can't capture a person's face,<br>but it has all the information an artist needs to create the artwork worthy of the person in the painting 50 years from now.</p>
  <p>And now,<br>three.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D0EhSi-vvc">The future of art, is already here</a>, it is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4NTf0hMjtY">Photogrammetry</a>,<br>beyond taking the photo of the subject, you should also consider a scan of their pose.</p>
  <p>Offer them a range of locations,<br>that you can generate a preview for.</p>
  <p>Technology will only improve,<br>but only a human will be able to artistically present the person in the photo or a virtual scan as the case will soon be.</p>
  <p>The world of art is evolving,<br>but no machine will ever replace a poet.</p>

class=\"section\">\n  <p>You start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,</p>\n  <p>there you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Organized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,</p>\n  <p>is in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Moreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,</p>\n  <p>aim to build on one another, they guarantee you won&apos;t understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,</p>\n  <p>with a more sugarcoated &quot;I am finally out&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,</p>\n  <p>and worse.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,</p>\n  <p>to replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It can only get worse,</p>\n  <p>a day will come when the Libraries will close.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>School and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,</p>\n  <p>an extension to your own self education.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your Education,</p>\n  <p>the pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,</p>\n  <p>we are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,</p>\n  <p>if we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,</p>\n  <p>but rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And the next step,</p>\n  <p>is your step.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Nothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,</p>\n  <p>it all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,</p>\n  <p>but eventually you&apos;ll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,</p>\n  <p>and that they just can&apos;t find a job for you, because you don&apos;t fit or conform.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>People believe this nonsense,</p>\n  <p>because they don&apos;t have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,</p>\n  <p>to acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,</p>\n  <p>you are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is the oldest and sickest trick,</p>\n  <p>to convince someone they don&apos;t matter.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They do it for personal gain, money or laziness,</p>\n  <p>to people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Get Up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Find your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,</p>\n  <p>The Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,</p>\n  <p>That! is your background.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now face Humanity anew,</p>\n  <p>out from the edge of the Universe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Look,</p>\n  <p>look at all those things that made you small.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Look how unimportant the inauthentic is,</p>\n  <p>how fragile those words that upset you really were.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And pay attention, to the real problem,</p>\n  <p>how easily you were tricked and mislead.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That cannot go on,</p>\n  <p>you are not a push around.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I wish you knew how Powerful you really are,</p>\n  <p>how easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>How All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,</p>\n  <p>the acquisition of wisdom really is.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,</p>\n  <p>and what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I don&apos;t think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,</p>\n  <p>it is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,</p>\n  <p>a Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,</p>\n  <p>from now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,</p>\n  <p>you will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,</p>\n  <p>has anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Hope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,</p>\n  <p>let them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t let anybody hurt you,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Go!</p>\n  <p>because you need your heart and mind, to grow.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Go!,</p>\n  <p>with the certainty of knowing that you are more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Go!,</p>\n  <p>so as long as you Rise you won&apos;t be lonely for long.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Go!</p>\n  <p>because there has never been a way other than forward and up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Go!</p>\n  <p>and don&apos;t be scared, all great journeys start with little things.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Others, who went through the same,</p>\n  <p>are with you in Spirit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So many invisible battles have been fought,</p>\n  <p>and as much triumph gone unnoticed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,</p>\n  <p>you are in company of Great Heroes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Climb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,</p>\n  <p>rise to the highest of mountains.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are Meant to Become a Great Being,</p>\n  <p>and You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Rise, and you will be well on your way,</p>\n  <p>Humanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Wherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,</p>\n  <p>no matter how small, each will help you learn more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>With each new success more pathways will become visible to you,</p>\n  <p>you are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is hard to see it all because you are still learning,</p>\n  <p>but it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It will never get easier,</p>\n  <p>but you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,</p>\n  <p>no one can teach you, you must find your own books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>By Subtle Analogy,</p>\n  <p>Rise to Your Greatness.</p>\n</div>",

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">How often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">how some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">your mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To integrate with wisdom,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">not only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">in just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Organized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Moreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">aim to build on one another, they guarantee you won't understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">with a more sugarcoated \"I am finally out\".</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and worse.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">to replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It can only get worse,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">a day will come when the Libraries will close.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">School and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">an extension to your own self education.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Your Education,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">What has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">if we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">All these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And the next step,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is your step.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Nothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but eventually you'll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and that they just can't find a job for you, because you don't fit or conform.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">People believe this nonsense,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because they don't have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">That is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">to acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is the oldest and sickest trick,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">to convince someone they don't matter.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">They do it for personal gain, money or laziness,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">to people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Get Up.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Find your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">That! is your background.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now face Humanity anew,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">out from the edge of the Universe.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Look,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">look at all those things that made you small.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Look how unimportant the inauthentic is,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">how fragile those words that upset you really were.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And pay attention, to the real problem,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">how easily you were tricked and mislead.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">That cannot go on,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you are not a push around.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I wish you knew how Powerful you really are,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">how easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">How All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the acquisition of wisdom really is.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Not all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I don't think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">a Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">from now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">No one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">has anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Hope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">let them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Don't let anybody hurt you,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">don't let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Go!</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because you need your heart and mind, to grow.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Go!,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">with the certainty of knowing that you are more.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Go!,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so as long as you Rise you won't be lonely for long.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Go!</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because there has never been a way other than forward and up.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom:

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Others, who went through the same,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">are with you in Spirit.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So many invisible battles have been fought,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and as much triumph gone unnoticed.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

You don't need a charging bear to learn.\nYou can use clay, or canvas, or music.\nThere is no finer way to push loneliness away,\nthan to sculpt the meaning of touch.\nAnd there is no better way to learn courage,\nthan to paint a chain of works that inspire to motion.\nAnd music need not make someone cry to be powerful,\nmake the beat move your own feet, as you run your first ultra.\n\nConsider how simple a Desktop in your Operating System is,\nand yet, how perfectly impossible it is, to drag the icon out of the computer.\nIt is right there, you can wiggle it,\nand yet it is trapped in a prison, of invisible walls.\n\nAnd consider, how different you are, from all the people you have met,\nhow you don't even smile at the things that make them laugh.\nHow not a single person out of the Eight Billion,\ncould possibly take your place.\nHow often it feels that all the people around you are sleepy,\nhow some seem different, because they could not do, what they do, if they were not wide awake.\nTo integrate with wisdom, you cannot read the same books others read,\nyour mind represents a perfectly unique constellation of stars.\nTo integrate with wisdom,\nnot only do you have to indirectly wiggle around by subtle analogy to other things.\nBut you have to fish out just the perfect morsels that fit you,\nin just the perfect sequence, out of a unique collection of mutually reinforcing works of Philosophy.\n\nYou start in the beginning, with Survey Courses, as these outline the most brilliant ideas first,\nthere you can recognize thoughts that fit you, that you already had in your constellation.\nOrganized Education, poisons your confidence in education, because everything they teach,\nis in an inhuman, synthetic, and impersonal sequence.\nMoreover, the easily forgotten and fragile clusters of incomplete information,\naim to build on one another, they guarantee you won't understand, and will only overwhelm you in the end.\nThe celebrating of a Diploma, is a sacred ritual, that has been erased, and replaced,\nwith a more sugarcoated \"I am finally out\".\nThis is a perfect recipe for bondage, blindness, weakness,\nand worse.\nWe must not allow a fake sugar pop triumph,\nto replace the Real Triumph or Knowledge and Wisdom.\nIt can only get worse,\na day will come when the Libraries will close.\nSchool and Library, above all, were meant to be a symbol,\nan extension to your own self education.\nYour Education,\nthe pathway to Peace, Safety, Security, Self Control, Harmony, Enlightenment.\n\nWhat has occurred to cause the fog, is a drop of packets of information,\nwe are too complex, the world is too complex, parenting is too complex, teaching is too complex.\nIt can get worse, if we continue celebrating false graduations, and fake education,\nif we keep forgetting that our family, has Eight Billion members and each must grow up for real.\nThe solution is to remind ourselves, that growing up is not about feeling like an adult,\nbut rather Transcending our Limits, and Pushing Through gaps, towards Wisdom.\nWe face problems that can only be solved by Intellectual or Cultural Unity.\nThe Problem of War, is solved by Education, Wisdom, and Unity.\nThe Problem of Education, is solved by Helping Everyone to a Fair Start.\nThe Problem of Crime, can be Solved by Mental Heath Care, and Prevention.\nThe Problem of Poverty and Slavery, is Solved by Universal Income.\nAll these problems are our problems, and the solutions are ours as well.\nBut they rest across a Gap, a gap that Humanity must cross.\nAnd the next step,\nis your step.\n\nNothing worth your precious time, can be faked, or made up, or make believe,\nit all has to be Authentic, Powerful, Guttural, Raw.\nIt will hurt in the Muscle and Bone,\nbut eventually you'll forget to pay attention to what is unimportant.\nYou are not to be taught that you are dime a dozen,\nand that they just can't find a job for you, because you don't fit or conform.\nPeople believe this nonsense,\nbecause they don't have anything to draw from by subtle analogy.\nThat is why we must challenge ourselves to Great Deeds,\nto acquire the experiences necessary to tell Wisdom from Waste.\nWhen you hear someone putting you down, pushing you around, belittling you,\nyou are to leave, because that someone has fractured and broke, and are now ill.\nIt is the oldest and sickest trick,\nto convince someone they don't matter.\nThey do it for personal gain, money or laziness,\nto people who do not have a library of Grand Experiences from which they can draw wisdom, by Subtle Analogy.\n\nGet Up.\nFind your temple of solitude, The Two Beautiful Trees, The Bridge Over Hudson River,\nThe Highway Overpass, The Starry Beach where the Stars Come Out at Night and mingle with Starfish.\nAnd know, that you are a Child of The Universe, first,\nThat! is your background.\nNow face Humanity anew,\nout from the edge of the Universe.\nLook,\nlook at all those things that made you small.\nLook how unimportant the inauthentic is,\nhow fragile those words that upset you really were.\n\nAnd pay attention, to the real problem,\nhow easily you were tricked and mislead.\nThat cannot go on,\nyou are not a push around.\nI wish you knew how Powerful you really are,\nhow easily you learn at your own pace in the sequence that fits you best.\nHow All Too Human, all too familiar, all too easy,\nthe acquisition of wisdom really is.\n\nNot all Adults are defined by Outspoken Wisdom, some find Greatness in Love Returned,\nand what a Great Power, can those Two even make a mistake?\nI don't think there is anything other than Love, that can substitute for Wisdom,\nit is both The Love of Two, and The Love of a Big Mother in a large family,\na Mother that always brings hugs, warm meals and Wisdom.\nBut, True Love is rare, so while you search, you must also grow in Wisdom,\nfrom now on, you will have to learn to tell the children apart from the adults.\nAnd not by looking at how old they are, or how well they dress, or how sharply they move in their environment,\nyou will now look at their Authenticity, and Content of Character.\nNo one who lacks in Authenticity, or has little Content of Character,\nhas anything to contribute to you life, certainly nothing negative.\nHope for them to recover, and become wise, and healthy,\nlet them know that they are a Child of The Universe, and they count - but go.\nDon't let anybody hurt you,\ndon't let anybody hurt your heart, or mind.\n\nGo!\nbecause you need your heart and mind, to grow.\nGo!,\nwith the certainty of knowing that you are more.\nGo!,\nso as long as you Rise you won't be lonely for long.\nGo!\nbecause there has never been a way other than forward and up.\nGo!\nand don't be scared, all great journeys start with little things.\n\nThe Others, who went through the same,\nare with you in Spirit.\nSo many invisible battles have been fought,\nand as much triumph gone unnoticed.\nThe Warriors are everywhere, and they stand by your side,\nyou are in company of Great Heroes.\nClimb by subtle analogy to the triumphs already had,\nrise to the highest of mountains.\nYou are Meant to Become a Great Being,\nand You are meant to remind others to follow a similar path.\nRise, and you will be well on your way,\nHumanity only grows, when people like you tear down those thin invisible walls.\n\nWherever you are right now, begin transcending your limits,\nno matter how small, each will help you learn more.\nWith each new success more pathways will become visible to you,\nyou are not trapped, you are just at the beginning of your journey.\nIt is hard to see it all because you are still learning,\nbut it is easy to read or listen to books, and inherit great visions from others.\nIt will never get easier,\nbut you will grow greater, to a point where ease will become irrelevant to your existence.\nYou must use your Heart and Mind to learn all the lessons ahead,\nno one can teach you, you must find your own books.\nBy Subtle Analogy,\nRise to Your Greatness.",

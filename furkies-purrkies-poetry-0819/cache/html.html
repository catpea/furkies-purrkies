  <p>I always have something to say,<br>usually spend thinking about it the whole day.</p>
  <p>But sometimes when 10PM comes about,<br>I decide to back out.</p>
  <p>I figured I’d write about programming, today,<br>then I thought better of it, and muttered, “No Way”</p>
  <p>So it turns out today,<br>is just that kind of day.</p>
  <p>Now, I need a new thing to write about,<br>hopefully I can quickly figure it out.</p>

  <p>It seems like a poem is always a good start,<br>so I think I nailed that part.</p>
  <p>And that is somewhat rhymes,<br>makes it better oftentimes.</p>
  <p>Plus, I went down to my laboratory,<br>as that always makes for a good story.</p>
  <p>And now I am sitting here,<br>waiting for a neat idea to appear.</p>

  <p>I had my dinner salad, to start,<br>lettuce, tomato, all dietary and smart.</p>
  <p>And I am sipping bottle of sparkling water I had,<br>the bottle was a bit dusty, but it does not taste too bad.</p>
  <p>Now, it has been 24 minutes since ten,<br>but I am glad I didn’t write about programming again.</p>

  <p>In all my writings rhyme holds a special place,<br>it much better than describing a visual programming interface.</p>
  <p>I guess I don’t have to point out,<br>that today I write about searching for something neat to write about.</p>
  <p>I thought about Plato his Socrates stories,<br>workouts and rehydration, dance songs, and writing without worries.</p>

  <p>But I think what I would like best,<br>is to write a tiny poem about searching for a poem, and get some rest.</p>
  <p>And I should keep it short to everyone's delight,<br>so I guess this here is the closing line, and Good Night.</p>

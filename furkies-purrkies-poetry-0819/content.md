I always have something to  say,
usually spend thinking about it the whole day.

But sometimes when 10PM comes about,
I decide to back out.

I figured I’d write about programming, today,
then I thought better of it, and muttered, “No Way”

So it turns out today,
is just that kind of day.

Now, I need a new thing to write about,
hopefully I can quickly figure it out.

It seems like a poem is always a good start,
so I think I nailed that part.

And that is somewhat rhymes,
makes it better oftentimes.

Plus, I went down to my laboratory,
as that always makes for a good story.

And now I am sitting here,
waiting for a neat idea to appear.

I had my dinner salad, to start,
lettuce, tomato, all dietary and smart.

And I am sipping bottle of sparkling water I had,
the bottle was a bit dusty, but it does not taste too bad.

Now, it has been 24 minutes since ten,
but I am glad I didn’t write about programming again.

---

In all my writings rhyme holds a special place,
it much better than describing a visual programming interface.

I guess I don’t have to point out,
that today I write about searching for something neat to write about.

I thought about Plato his Socrates stories,
workouts and rehydration, dance songs, and writing without worries.

---

But I think what I would like best,
is to write a tiny poem about searching for a poem, and get some rest.

And I should keep it short to everyone's delight,
so I guess this here is the closing line, and Good Night.

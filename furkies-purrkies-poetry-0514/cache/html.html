  <p>Adventures, quests, vacations, camping, and roads trips,<br>very often help our minds rest and recover from overwork.</p>
  <p>There is some negativity associated with travel,<br>people who move around are looked down on.</p>
  <p>But, I think some people take to longer travels,<br>when they feel like they are away from themselves.</p>

  <p>I think they need support,<br>not negativity.</p>
  <p>They need to be encouraged,<br>to find themselves.</p>
  <p>Once they feel comfy again,<br>they'll ease up with their travels.</p>

  <p>Overwork, and getting caught up in complexities of life,<br>also has the effect of making the world seem much simpler than it really is.</p>
  <p>People are way to overworked,<br>an they overlook, and sometimes forget all the things that are beautiful to them.</p>
  <p>The things that are beautiful to us,<br>are our map to growing all the way up.</p>

  <p>It is a great tragedy,<br>that we can only live once.</p>
  <p>And there is no need for a better reason,<br>to set of on a series, of comfy adventures.</p>
  <p>There is no arguing that we are each an artist,<br>and our hidden talents exist in the reals of Composing Music, Painting Grand Portraits, Clay Sculpture, and more.</p>

  <p>Out minds need us to find ways to make those connections,<br>each time we travel from one star to the next, we grow.</p>
  <p>And finding ourselves, scanning for the stars and building new constellations,<br>is as tough as finding an interesting book with a good narrator.</p>
  <p>Be it a hobby, or a travel destination,<br>don't expect the first one to become the bees knees.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there is a period of maybe three or five days,<br>for the hold that overwork has on us to weaken and let go.</p>
  <p>Living in a state of overwork,<br>and always pushing vacation away, is very sad, and unhealthy.</p>
  <p>Once we figure all this out,<br>we have to help others to their little adventures.</p>

  <p>We can't let anything interrupt our growing up,<br>we don't have to become great orators with great speeches on our resume.</p>
  <p>But we can't let poverty, or career, or office politics,<br>stand in our way of growing up.</p>
  <p>At the very least, we should try to imagine our elder selves,<br>and see what their regrets may be, if any.</p>

  <p>In closing and on a personal note,<br>many years ago when I went on my adventures.</p>
  <p>I discovered I loved good books,<br>up until then I only read a bunch of cheap paperbacks.</p>
  <p>But when I got a hold of Bill Bryson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a>,<br>not only did I discover I liked big books, but also that I liked day dreaming about Science.</p>

  <p>Before then, I always though I was more of a Computer and Art person,</p>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>and now I wonder if maybe I could become a writer of short and funny stories,</li>
</ul>
<div class="section">
  <p>That is another thing that we gain when we discover our constellations,<br>we become foolish and cheerful, and full of funny tings to say.</p>
  <p>So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23QqGLt4-4w">grab a tent even if just to camp in your back yard</a>, or a new audio book; or oils, canvas and an easel; or a brick of air dry clay, and start searching for your next star.<br>and remember we are <em>all</em> meant to become Great Beings, and every great journey starts with a tiny step.</p>

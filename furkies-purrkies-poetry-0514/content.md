Adventures, quests, vacations, camping, and roads trips,
very often help our minds rest and recover from overwork.

There is some negativity associated with travel,
people who move around are looked down on.

But, I think some people take to longer travels,
when they feel like they are away from themselves.

---

I think they need support,
not negativity.

They need to be encouraged,
to find themselves.

Once they feel comfy again,
they'll ease up with their travels.

---

Overwork, and getting caught up in complexities of life,
also has the effect of making the world seem much simpler than it really is.

People are way to overworked,
an they overlook, and sometimes forget all the things that are beautiful to them.

The things that are beautiful to us,
are our map to growing all the way up.

---

It is a great tragedy,
that we can only live once.

And there is no need for a better reason,
to set of on a series, of comfy adventures.

There is no arguing that we are each an artist,
and our hidden talents exist in the reals of Composing Music, Painting Grand Portraits, Clay Sculpture, and more.

---

Out minds need us to find ways to make those connections,
each time we travel from one star to the next, we grow.

And finding ourselves, scanning for the stars and building new constellations,
is as tough as finding an interesting book with a good narrator.

Be it a hobby, or a travel destination,
don't expect the first one to become the bees knees.

---

Moreover, there is a period of maybe three or five days,
for the hold that overwork has on us to weaken and let go.

Living in a state of overwork,
and always pushing vacation away, is very sad, and unhealthy.

Once we figure all this out,
we have to help others to their little adventures.

---

We can't let anything interrupt our growing up,
we don't have to become great orators with great speeches on our resume.

But we can't let poverty, or career, or office politics,
stand in our way of growing up.

At the very least, we should try to imagine our elder selves,
and see what their regrets may be, if any.

---

In closing and on a personal note,
many years ago when I went on my adventures.

I discovered I loved good books,
up until then I only read a bunch of cheap paperbacks.

But when I got a hold of Bill Bryson's [A Short History of Nearly Everything][1],
not only did I discover I liked big books, but also that I liked day dreaming about Science.

---

Before then, I always though I was more of a Computer and Art person,
- and now I wonder if maybe I could become a writer of short and funny stories,

That is another thing that we gain when we discover our constellations,
we become foolish and cheerful, and full of funny tings to say.

So, [grab a tent even if just to camp in your back yard][2], or a new audio book; or oils, canvas and an easel; or a brick of air dry clay, and start searching for your next star.
and remember we are _all_ meant to become Great Beings, and every great journey starts with a tiny step.

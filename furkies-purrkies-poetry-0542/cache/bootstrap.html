    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Let me try break this down for you,<br>above all, prison does not make people better, and human beings get ill from sitting in cages.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Prisons shouldn't exist, falling apart to a point of committing a crime is a psychological crisis,<br>individual who are in that state need a doctor and a psychologist, they need support, love and understanding.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Additionally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoHywbaR8">non-violent crimes should not result in a prison sentence</a>,<br>and a jury of well off white suburbians who never faced the street, or slept behind a trash container, and who don't want to be in court, is not a real jury.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I also wan to single out addiction, and drug possession, as a psychological problem,<br>it is not a crime, it is an illness - punishing a drug addict with prison is evil.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though public defenders are the heroes here, they are overloaded, and can't handle the persecution,<br>which has more resources than they need, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAXpjrjjmMY">incredible new powers such as geo fencing, that arises from what should be illegal-mass-surveillance</a></div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Until convicted, a person should not put into jail or prison,<br>and in court, they should be able to chose a legal firm, including the most prestigious ones, and this would cost them nothing - because money and justice does not mix.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Addressing prisons and crime, is actually very little,<br>these repairs that I have mentioned here merely correct mistakes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What we need is prevention,<br>and that means universal income, or free money, or a bottomless credit card with nothing more than a daily limit.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Where will crime be, when everyone is given a credit card with a hundred dollar daily spending limit,<br>it will pay for rent, for food, for computer, books, for books, for 3D printers, and other temporary curiosities that expand the mind, that help us grow.</div>

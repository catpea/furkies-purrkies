  "text": "Humanity's advancement forward,\nmust be our primary concern.\nBy standing still,\nwe make room for liars and parasites.\nThe sustained momentum with which we move forward,\nshould be one of our greatest treasures.\n\nThe pressure to stop advancing,\ncan only come from those who benefit from illness.\nThese boogie man tales of economic collapse,\narising from people no longer struggling in poverty - are lies.\nThis is the same pattern of behavior,\nthat kept slaves from rising.\n\nDoomsday Tales, Overwork, Uneducation,\nare the tools of a slave owner.\nBuilding walls while telling each other that people over the next border,\nare bad, or different, or not us, or criminal.\nIs very similar to to slave owners were not telling their slaves,\nabout great cities, about happy and friendly people - the uprisings were prevented from occurring, because nobody knew anything to rise to.\n\nNo one should be allowed\nto benefit from poverty, war, misery, crime, uneducated consumers, uninformed patients, and cheap employees.\nSomeone dialed the wrong number this morning,\nand this is a voice message I got at 3 AM, PLAYS a little later, I got another one PLAYS\n\nThese recordings show how crime creates money, $20 at a time,\nit is a massive industry, that with the way things are - will never be stopped.\nAshley Williams, who you may remember from the \"I am NOT a Superpredator[1]\" event,\nmight have been in part inspired by Michelle Alexander[2]'s \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness[3]\".\nThat goes into more detail,\nabout the prison industry.\n\nIt is very difficult to spot the companies that are making money,\nbecause most of them will put up beautiful messages about keeping families connected.\nHow not to appreciate that kind of work,\nand dedication and foresight.\nBecause these companies, do nothing to prevent crime,\nthey position themselves to feed on families that were just ripped apart.\n\nSee normal people would make this communication free,\nthe real super-predators say PLAYS\nThere would be no moneymaking here,\nno premium communication programs, no we need your credit card first.\nA normal person would never think of making money here,\nbut a evil person bates people into signing up with a free weekly phone call - an option which didn't originally exist, according to their website.\n\nPlease note how hard it is to see the evil behind all this,\non the surface, and even beneath the surface, there is no visible wrong doing here.\nLet me try break this down for you,\nabove all, prison does not make people better, and human beings get ill from sitting in cages.\nPrisons shouldn't exist, falling apart to a point of committing a crime is a psychological crisis,\nindividual who are in that state need a doctor and a psychologist, they need support, love and understanding.\nAdditionally, non-violent crimes should not result in a prison sentence[4],\nand a jury of well off white suburbians who never faced the street, or slept behind a trash container, and who don't want to be in court, is not a real jury.\nI also wan to single out addiction, and drug possession, as a psychological problem,\nit is not a crime, it is an illness -

  <p>These boogie man tales of economic collapse,<br>arising from people no longer struggling in poverty - are lies.</p>

  <p>Is very similar to to slave owners were not telling their slaves,<br>about great cities, about happy and friendly people - the uprisings were prevented from occurring, because nobody knew anything to rise to.</p>

  <p>These recordings show how crime creates money, $20 at a time,<br>it is a massive industry, that with the way things are - will never be stopped.</p>
  <p>Ashley Williams, who you may remember from the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXDpPCTOCac">I am NOT a Superpredator</a>" event,<br>might have been in part inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ6H-Mz6hgw">Michelle Alexander</a>'s "<a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-New-Jim-Crow-Audiobook/B007QW236E">The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness</a>".</p>

  <p>It is very difficult to spot the companies that are making money,<br>because most of them will put up beautiful messages about keeping families connected.</p>
  <p>How <em>not to</em> appreciate that kind of work,<br>and dedication and foresight.</p>
  <p>Because these companies, do nothing to prevent crime,<br>they position themselves to feed on families that were just ripped apart.</p>

  <p>There would be no moneymaking here,<br>no premium communication programs, no we need your credit card first.</p>
  <p>A normal person would never think of making money here,<br>but a evil person bates people into signing up with a free weekly phone call - an option which didn't originally exist, according to their website.</p>

  <p>Please note how hard it is to see the evil behind all this,<br>on the surface, and even beneath the surface, there is no visible wrong doing here.</p>
  <p>Let me try break this down for you,<br>above all, prison does not make people better, and human beings get ill from sitting in cages.</p>
  <p>Prisons shouldn't exist, falling apart to a point of committing a crime is a psychological crisis,<br>individual who are in that state need a doctor and a psychologist, they need support, love and understanding.</p>
  <p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnuoHywbaR8">non-violent crimes should not result in a prison sentence</a>,<br>and a jury of well off white suburbians who never faced the street, or slept behind a trash container, and who don't want to be in court, is not a real jury.</p>
  <p>I also wan to single out addiction, and drug possession, as a psychological problem,<br>it is not a crime, it is an illness - punishing a drug addict with prison is evil.</p>
  <p>Though public defenders are the heroes here, they are overloaded, and can't handle the persecution,<br>which has more resources than they need, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAXpjrjjmMY">incredible new powers such as geo fencing, that arises from what should be illegal-mass-surveillance</a></p>
  <p>Until convicted, a person should not put into jail or prison,<br>and in court, they should be able to chose a legal firm, including the most prestigious ones, and this would cost them nothing - because money and justice does not mix.</p>
  <p>Addressing prisons and crime, is actually very little,<br>these repairs that I have mentioned here merely correct mistakes.</p>
  <p>What we need is prevention,<br>and that means universal income, or free money, or a bottomless credit card with nothing more than a daily limit.</p>
  <p>Where will crime be, when everyone is given a credit card with a hundred dollar daily spending limit,<br>it will pay for rent, for food, for computer, books, for books, for 3D printers, and other temporary curiosities that expand the mind, that help us grow.</p>
  <p>Where will the gas station robberies be,<br>where even the most desperate person in the world will have money.</p>

  <p>Today, we laugh at the idea of free money,<br>but tolerate the idea that some people need prison, for doing things that keep their heads from falling apart from... poverty.</p>
  <p>This is why, growing all the way up,<br>and adding to the momentum with which Humanity is advancing must be one of the most important things on our mind.</p>
  <p>There is nothing acceptable about the disproportionate mass incarceration of people fractured by poverty,<br>and there is nothing wrong, with ending poverty.</p>
  <p>Rather than putting in an effort into collecting phone sensor data for the purposes,<br>of catching all the criminals in the world.</p>
  <p>We just need to put effort into preventing crime,<br>by ending poverty.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>And by ending poverty, we also end wage slavery, we also end businesses that that make money,<br>off of moms needing to talk to their sons, who suffered poverty on a degree that pushed them into addiction, a punishment that is no doubt far greater than any prison.</p>
  <p>By ending poverty we give people time,<br>to think, to learn.</p>
  <p>We give the children time to grow up,<br>without fracturing from poverty.</p>

  <p>The problem of mass incarceration become so great,<br>that we have begun decriminalizing drugs to keep children out of prison.</p>
  <p>But that also sends the wrong message, it sends the message of using drugs and alcohol to treat problems that arise from the global state of poverty,<br>chemically induced productivity, no slaver could ask for more.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-0KfwFCMRM">Along with decriminalization of drugs, we must also remove the need for them</a>,<br>World Poverty must end.</p>
  <p>By not ending world poverty,<br>we are enslaving the future generations to all these broken ideas, and then some.</p>

  <p>To begin today, all we have to do,<br>is help the children understand that prisons are wrong, that using money to keep wall street and military rich, and people poor - is madness.</p>
  <p>We must stop acting in a way that indoctrinates children into this culture of injustice,<br>the shortest path there, is to help children to the great and life changing narrated books at the local library, books like "<a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/The-New-Jim-Crow-Audiobook/B007QW236E">The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness</a>"</p>
  <p>And above all help them reject fake or ineffective education,<br>and understand that that Knowledge begets Wisdom, and Wisdom begets Greatness.</p>

  <p>The only thing that will help humanity grow,<br>is wisdom, and we have learned this long ago.</p>

  <p>If problems are not prevented,<br>then liars will destroy everything precious we invented.</p>
  <p>Corrupting education is the oldest trick invented by naves,<br>it is how people are tricked into becoming slaves.</p>

  <p>Fake education is a powerful theatrical game,<br>even knowing this people will still go for it all the same.</p>

  <p>Who could ever think pixel art can make a family safe and unafraid,<br>or that drawing portraits of celebrities will get the bills paid.</p>

  <p>Class is an important component of wisdom and greatness,<br>and that is what self education helps the students witness.</p>
  <p>Once they taste their first art show,<br>they will learn something they didn't know.</p>
  <p>They will learn that with authenticity they are capable of great height,<br>and that all along, it has been their right.</p>
  <p>Something as silly as screenfulls of pixel art or interesting computer code,<br>will help them think in a higher mode.</p>
  <p>They will see themselves as creators and part of the future of Humankind,<br>and rather than overwork they will take to improving their mind.</p>
  <p>Standardized education only forces students to memorize and pretend to know,<br>is just dog and pony show.</p>
  <p>We can't tolerate the theft of wisdom and a chance at becoming great,<br>the schools in their greed are teaching students not to invent and create.</p>

  <p>A school that does not ignite the culture of greatness,<br>is fake and it dims the worlds brightness.</p>
  <p>We can all agree that life dear,<br>therefore we must encourage students to wisdom prior to a career.</p>

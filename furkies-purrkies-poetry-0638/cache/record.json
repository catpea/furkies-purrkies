  "text": "Wisdom is still our best invention,\nand it is the only road to problem prevention.\n\nWe have people who refuse to wear a mask\nand get angry at those who fulfill that task.\nOthers say un-vaccinated shouldn't get a place at a hospital,\nbut both are losing their minds little by little.\nThey are like this because of the culture they were raised in,\nlack of wisdom is how all these troubles begin.\n\nPoliticians, leaders, principals, teachers, parent are all at fault,\nwithout wisdom the world will run in circles without result.\n\nThere are multiple plans in place across the world,\nbut things won't work even if everyone does what they are told.\nBecause there is scarcely a leader that has become wise,\nas greatness is still a rare prize.\nThe only thing that will help humanity grow,\nis wisdom, and we have learned this long ago.\n\nIf problems are not prevented,\nthen liars will destroy everything precious we invented.\nCorrupting education is the oldest trick invented by naves,\nit is how people are tricked into becoming slaves.\nA corrupt education is one that only makes us think we learn and know,\nbut at its core it is just for the show.\n\nFake education is a powerful theatrical game,\neven knowing this people will still go for it all the same.\nToday school is about pretending to learn by just memorizing for tests,\nand as a side effect to line pockets of all the liars and pests.\nWho could ever think pixel art can make a family safe and unafraid,\nor that drawing portraits of celebrities will get the bills paid.\nThe act of creation,\nis the only worthwhile foundation.\nIt does not aim to fill a student's mind,\nbut lights their flame to Nobly help the Humankind.\n\nLife without wisdom doesn't work, you know,\nit only tricks us to think slow.\nIt always comes as a surprise,\nto find an adult willing to admit they are not yet wise.\nBut that is exactly what fake education will do,\nit will steal from you.\nIt will take all the wisdom and leave us fighting,\nat a time when we should be uniting.\n\nEverything that surrounds us is misunderstood and messing with our heads.\nit is not just masks and hospital beds.\nEvery argument where both sides are wrong,\nprevents Humanity from growing strong.\nThere are so many misunderstandings that most arguments simply waste life,\nwithout wisdom we will only ague about meaningless misery and strife.\n\nInstead of disagreement Humanity must ask what is the next thing we can fix,\notherwise we'll waste our minds on broken politics.\n\nWe should be very angry that we accepted neutered education that bans books,\nand merely feeds checks to all the pretenders and crooks.\nIn a century that we knew had a pandemic coming,\neducating children to deal with it was the real force of overcoming.\nAnd instead of having them fight in all the wars ahead,\nwe have to teach children peace and wisdom instead.\n\nBroken schools,\ncan only manufacture sharp tools.\nThis is the greatest tragedy Humanity has seen,\nand the only way out of it is wisdom and intellectual hygiene.\nWe have to leave all the bad ideas behind,\nbecause we can't see the future when we are divided and blind.\n\nThis is heaven, right here right now,\nand every one of us must to make the future better somehow.\nNow is when we leave our mark,\nwhile we still own that precious spark.\n...in our books, poems, and especially portraits and pixel art,\nbecause self education is the only way to become wise and smart.\n\nWhen you argue politics and misidentify basic hopes and dreams calling everything a system,\nthat only means someone stole your wisdom.\nOnly a fools can hope to live in poverty and keep the world starving too,\nwe need to start thinking things though.\nOur highest political hopes are nowhere close to prevent children being born poor,\nthat is how sick our delusions of grandeur.\n\nWe are at the lowest levels of our development and wisdom,\nScience is the only functional system.\nBorders, religions, prisons, forced poverty, and turning young people into tools,\nis exactly why we need real education and schools.\n\nWhat marks a real school is that it induces a culture of wisdom and class,\nthat is the real test that students must pass.\n\nClass is an important component of wisdom and greatness,\nand that is what self education helps the students witness.\nOnce they taste their first art show,\nthey will learn something they didn't know.\nThey will learn that with authenticity they are capable of great height,\nand that all along, it has been their right.\nSomething as silly as screenfulls of pixel art or interesting computer code,\nwill help them think in a higher mode.\nThey will see themselves as creators and part of the future of Humankind,\nand rather than overwork they will take to improving their mind.\nStandardized education only forces students to memorize and pretend to know,\nis just dog and pony show.\nWe can't tolerate the theft of wisdom and a chance at becoming great,\nthe schools in their greed are teaching students not to invent and create.\n\nThe class and culture that the students should adopt,\nmust neither be warped nor stopped.\nIt is their wisdom, dignity, and their brilliance,\nthe very thing behind their resilience.\nA school that does not ignite the culture of greatness,\nis fake and it dims the worlds brightness.\nWe can all agree that life dear,\ntherefore we must encourage students to wisdom prior to a career.\nWe are the opposite of machines and tools,\nmay you be part of the movement that builds real schools.",

  <p>Everyone involved in your education,<br>has just brainlessly conspired to make you feel stupid.</p>
  <p>Mostly because it is easy money,<br>but also to make themselves feel special.</p>

  <p>By tricking you into thinking that you are just not that smart,<br>they don’t have to do anything to teach you anything.</p>

  <p>They aren’t teaching you,<br>they are giving you answers to memorize.</p>
  <p>Now they do introduce some fuzz in the middle,<br>to make things more than just memorization.</p>
  <p>But not much more,<br>and you don’t need to do them to pass the test.</p>

  <p>The magical free ride tuition, if you get one,<br>is also based on thin layers.</p>
  <p>If you start freaking out that the lectures are too much,<br>which they are, because everything is ineffective.</p>
  <p>Standardized education cannot be made effective,<br>it is impossible to lecture to more than five people.</p>
  <p>And there is no money,<br>in highly customized instruction.</p>
  <p>So it is always the maximum number of students,<br>to get the maximum amount of money.</p>

  <p>The mind of a young person is sacred,<br>send in all the people that think it is OK to do that, and those who want war.</p>

  <p>As to the poverty that this quest will cast you into,<br>become an artist, designer, 3D modeler, and a programmer, which is to say enter the culture of constant self education.</p>
  <p>At the very least,<br>it will help you to stop being scared of poverty.</p>
  <p>This is not a perfect plan, it is a desperate plan,<br>but since you are going at your own pace, and in a sequence that matches your existing knowledge... you will learn fast.</p>
  <p>We are all Einstein-smart, we just need to take baby-steps first,<br>and make our way to the next level, on our own, without being pushed.</p>
  <p>That is why the education you have been receiving thus far didn't work,<br>because you can't be taught outside in, you can only learn inside out.</p>
  <p>Being pressured to get good grades when you are pushed outside in, or taught,<br>will only get you into "discovering", memorization, in other words you are being tricked into memorizing.</p>
  <p>Teachers know you will never admit to that, because it was hard work,<br>and if you complain they will retest you and you will fail needing to through that memorization hell again.</p>
  <p>It is part of their scam, they get you in a catch-22, between a rock in a hard place,<br>and get a kick and a paycheck out of it.</p>
  <p>To be clear - they know you are worthlessly memorizing,<br>because they got you to do it, under the threat of repeating the class or just being held back a year and permanently marked as delayed.</p>

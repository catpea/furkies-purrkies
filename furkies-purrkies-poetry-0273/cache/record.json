  "text": "Wisdom, is our Universal Language,\nimagine two wise beings from nations that dislike each other.\n\nThere is nothing but admiration,\nthe wish to share, and communicate.\n\nWhile we all know some English,\nthere is a lot those two have to say to each other.\n\nOne dreams about rebuilding the United States,\nas The United States of The World.\n\nThe Other wants to look into every corner,\nto be certain that mis-education is eating the world.\n\nThere cannot be dislikes here,\nonly Love and Understanding, in Wisdom.\n\nWisdom calls to Love,\nEverywhere.\n\nWithout wisdom a Police officer will unravel into a thug,\nwith wisdom, disobey orders and protect those who fight for goodness.\n\nWithout wisdom, children made to become soldiers, will kill each other,\nwith wisdom, they will turn right around and look their fathers, and commanders in the eyes.\n\nWithout wisdom politicians will fuel tensions among the nations of the world,\nwith wisdom, they will immediately dismantle nuclear weapons and ban war, not just unethical weapons.\n\nWithout wisdom religious leaders divide the world and create open wounds that will never heal,\nin wisdom, they will rise up against human rights violations and become popularizes of science and reason.\n\nWithout wisdom leaders will see criminals as \"needing to be brought to heel\",\nwith wisdom, they will see children who never had a real chance at the good life.\n\nWithout wisdom, agencies claiming to protect nations will subvert democracy and destroy the nations they were sworn to protect,\nwith wisdom, they will respectfully prevent the unwise from gaining access to or remaining in positions of authority.\n\nWithout wisdom, Earth will be brought to a crisis that will cause mass starvation and call for population control,\nwith wisdom, businesses that contribute to the Anthropocene Extinction will have to close as profits have no meaning in a world without a future.\n\nWithout wisdom, governments will be blind to poverty and prevent generations of children from growing up,\nwith wisdom, money will be used to help people not erase their minds.\n\nWithout wisdom, broken children will become broken men and in poverty of mind parade the color of their skin, or hair as a sign of superiority,\nwith wisdom we will admire our beautiful uniqueness the wy we admire the colors of each others eyes.\n\nThe word Philosophy comes from Greek,\nit means Love of Wisdom.\n\nAll wisdom is the same,\nthere is no bad wisdom, or good wisdom, just Universal wisdom.\n\nWisdom is special,\nit is like an operating system.\n\nUnlike a computer operating system,\nwisdom independently emerges in sufficiently educated individual beings.\n\nIt is something that we are predisposed for, by Nature,\nWisdom is the next big step that Humanity must take.\n\nIneffective Education, and Education driven by propaganda or fantasies,\nis hurting our progress forward.\n\nOur education is a very delicate process,\nfear of being held back, or bad grades, or being taught fairy tales or falsehoods delays our progress.\n\nPoverty, homelessness, hunger, self medication, and violence,\nprevents us from learning, and we cannot make out way towards wisdom in that state.\n\nWe have to protect the children from our lack of wisdom,\nand help them to understand that the only way they can have a future is by means of Wisdom and the Love it entails.\n\nWe have to encourage children to become Great Beings,\nand we have to admit that we can't fix the world because it is a multi-generational project.\n\nThe repairs that are required rely on increased levels of Honest and Real Education throughout the world,\nno more noise, no more haste, no more grades or levels or division that render subjects incomprehensible.\n\nA real school is marked by real results,\nby helping all their students towards Real Wisdom onward to helping them become Great Beings.\n\nToday, very few graduates can see value in retaking all exams that helped them graduate,\nand fewer still would be able to get the grades that prove that school was effective.\n\nWe confuse our amazing ability to learn, with school's ability to teach,\nand we suffer for it, most of us are tricked into thinking that we aren't that smart, but the truth is that the school isn't that good.\n\nDo not let schools trick you away from Wisdom,\nwe are an important link in a chain that connect past to the future, we must aim to become wise and teach wisdom as the highest value.\n\nThe world will stand still when divided,\nwhen united in wisdom we will rise.",

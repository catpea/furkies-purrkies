  <p>Money, and it is difficult for you to believe that,<br>because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts">all the teachers want to sell you out, no exceptions</a>.</p>
  <p>They can’t afford to care,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">if they start caring about you, they will lose their jobs</a>.</p>
  <p>If they start caring about how you feel,<br>then they will have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GNInLhL2zA">face all the students</a> that they <strong>already</strong> sold out for a paycheck.</p>
  <p>Every grade, less than an A F****G plus, was a lie,<br>it NEVER had anything to do with your intelligence, it was always about your obedience.</p>
  <p>Because if you obey, if you follow the directions,<br>they can get paid, they can live a life.</p>
  <p>If you are not obedient,<br>then you are interfering with their ability to put food on their table.</p>
  <p>They will throw you under the bus,<br>and you will repeat the last year of High School.</p>

  <p>They just want to get paid,<br>they can’t go off script.</p>
  <p>The teachers have instructions for lectures, you got your textbooks,<br>there are matching tests, matching finals, and matching state tests.</p>
  <p>There are people who will swear,<br>there are people who will swear they are improving quality of lectures.</p>
  <p>They also want to get paid,<br>they try very hard to forget the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">tests are standardized, and thus cant work</a>.</p>

  <p>But if you put up with it all,<br>a almost all teachers will try to slide you along, then everything will look fine on paper.</p>
  <p>You’ll go to college, get in debt,<br>and that debt will motivate you, as if your credit score was your new GPA.</p>
  <p>A lot of people in their 60s are still paying off their schools,<br>they have no choice, student loans are unforgivable by bankruptcy.</p>
  <p>They will be forcefully,<br>taken out of you paycheck.</p>

  <p>So, relax, it is all horse shit,<br>you are smart.</p>
  <p>Teachers are just temporarily hurting you,<br>so that you start memorizing, so that they can get paid.</p>
  <p>In fact you are so smart,<br>and you ability to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsC9ZHi79jo">navigate that which you do comprehend</a> is so powerful.</p>
  <p>That if I told you just how powerful your mind is,<br>you would call this poem horse shit, and start memorizing to improve your grades.</p>

  <p>I will talk about famous neck beard for a moment,<br>he’s currently resting at Westminster Abby.</p>
  <p>You know how he cracked the laws of universe,<br>he didn’t independently invent calculus by merely studying math.</p>
  <p>Though he knew enough math,<br>to truly calculate a circle from an ellipse, poor bastard.</p>
  <p>He did it by building models,<br>he hid them from everyone.</p>
  <p>He hid them harder,<br>than his dumb-ass research for turning led to gold.</p>
  <p>He was trying to present him self,<br>as super smart.</p>

  <p>You can’t learn math for real,<br>without gently following its history dot for dot.</p>
  <p>Schools,<br>aren’t capable of teaching Math, you can only memorize your PIr2,</p>
  <p>Which is wrong, Because it is TAU,<br>and you need to stick with Unit Circle, so there is no r, it is just 1.</p>
  <p>The whole formula for circle,<br>is just tau, just 3.14.</p>

  <p>If you are going to be held back an extra year in High School,<br>that does not mean the bullies have one, it means you get to be young for an extra year.</p>

  <p>Make no mistake, the meaning of life, is to become a great being,<br>by means of real and authentic education, which at the moment means, self education.</p>
  <p>By the time you graduate High School, you need to master Programming node.js <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+a+Startup+Accelerator">for your startups</a>, Photo Realism in Krita,<br>3d Modeling and Geometry Nodes in Blender, Industrial Design and 3D Printing, and at the very least, Berlin School Techo in LMMS.</p>
  <p>Don't let the world trick you out of real education,<br>every new thing yo learn must perfect must perfectly fit your existing knowledge.</p>
  <p>In the wonderful chaos of life, you won't retain things that you do not practice,<br>and you can't practice things that aren't integrated into what you care about.</p>

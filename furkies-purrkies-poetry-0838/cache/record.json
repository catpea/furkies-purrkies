  "text": "Money, and it is difficult for you to believe that,\nbecause all the teachers want to sell you out, no exceptions[1].\nThey can’t afford to care,\nif they start caring about you, they will lose their jobs[2].\nIf they start caring about how you feel,\nthen they will have to face all the students[3] that they already sold out for a paycheck.\nEvery grade, less than an A F****G plus, was a lie,\nit NEVER had anything to do with your intelligence, it was always about your obedience.\nBecause if you obey, if you follow the directions,\nthey can get paid, they can live a life.\nIf you are not obedient,\nthen you are interfering with their ability to put food on their table.\nThey will throw you under the bus,\nand you will repeat the last year of High School.\n\nThey just want to get paid,\nthey can’t go off script.\nThe teachers have instructions for lectures, you got your textbooks,\nthere are matching tests, matching finals, and matching state tests.\nThere are people who will swear,\nthere are people who will swear they are improving quality of lectures.\nThey also want to get paid,\nthey try very hard to forget the tests are standardized, and thus cant work[4].\n\nBut if you put up with it all,\na almost all teachers will try to slide you along, then everything will look fine on paper.\nYou’ll go to college, get in debt,\nand that debt will motivate you, as if your credit score was your new GPA.\nA lot of people in their 60s are still paying off their schools,\nthey have no choice, student loans are unforgivable by bankruptcy.\nThey will be forcefully,\ntaken out of you paycheck.\n\nSo, relax, it is all horse shit,\nyou are smart.\nTeachers are just temporarily hurting you,\nso that you start memorizing, so that they can get paid.\nIn fact you are so smart,\nand you ability to navigate that which you do comprehend[5] is so powerful.\nThat if I told you just how powerful your mind is,\nyou would call this poem horse shit, and start memorizing to improve your grades.\nBut we don’t want that,\nso I won’t tell you how smart you really are.\n\nI will talk about famous neck beard for a moment,\nhe’s currently resting at Westminster Abby.\nYou know how he cracked the laws of universe,\nhe didn’t independently invent calculus by merely studying math.\nThough he knew enough math,\nto truly calculate a circle from an ellipse, poor bastard.\nHe did it by building models,\nhe hid them from everyone.\nHe hid them harder,\nthan his dumb-ass research for turning led to gold.\nHe was trying to present him self,\nas super smart.\nHe wasn’t a genius,\nhe was just doing what school is robbing you off.\n\nAnd I am so sorry about that,\nI never stopped wishing I could fix it.\n\nHe was just slowly, very slowly, kissing up to his curiosities,\nhe was moving so slowly that the lovely Neil DeGrasse Tyson...\nis by contrast,\nmoving at the speed of light.\nNeil's explanation for learning math[6],\nis just regurgitate until it makes sense.\nI give that advice for learning complicated computer programs,\nthat have video tutorials but no documentation.\nSteven Hawking explained it better than Mr. Tyson[7],\nby infinitely emphasizing the important of the study of the HISTORY of mathematics[8].\n\nYou can’t learn math for real,\nwithout gently following its history dot for dot.\nSchools,\naren’t capable of teaching Math, you can only memorize your PIr2,\nWhich is wrong, Because it is TAU,\nand you need to stick with Unit Circle, so there is no r, it is just 1.\nThe whole formula for circle,\nis just tau, just 3.14.\n\nModern Trigonometry instruction is horseshit too[9],\nit is horrifying what they are doing to you, I am so sorry.\n\nYou have to let go of stressing out about grades, graduations, and horseshit,\nand you have to start learning for real.\nDon’t be the kid that gets the good grades,\nor that freaks out about being held back a year.\nIf you are going to be held back an extra year in High School,\nthat does not mean the bullies have one, it means you get to be young for an extra year.\nAnd you are only going to get an extra year,\nbefore they start calling you gifted.\n\nListen to books,\ndon’t read them, that really sucks, listen to them.\nListen to all of them,\nyou have to, because you are not going to get a real education in school.\n\nIf you have bullies at home or school, know that what they really want,\nis to turn you into a bull too, use the police to fight back.\nYou have to be more careful in life,\nyou shouldn't have ever let anyone trick you into thinking that you are not smart.\n\nIf there are others who have been tricked in similar ways,\nor if you notice someone stressing about their A’s way too much.\nPut a book club together,\ncall it the A-Team, trade your books together, and resist life trying to tell you apart.\nAnd you know,\nchange the world.\nCome your golden are share your Life’s Lessons in such a way,\nthat others may begin, where you leave off.\n\nMake no mistake, the meaning of life, is to become a great being,\nby means of real and authentic education, which at the moment means, self education.\nBy the time you graduate High School, you need to master Programming node.js for your startups[10], Photo Realism in Krita,\n3d Modeling and Geometry Nodes in Blender, Industrial Design and 3D Printing, and at the very least, Berlin School Techo in LMMS.\nDon't let the world trick you out of real education,\nevery new thing yo learn must perfect must perfectly fit your existing knowledge.\nIn the wonderful chaos of life, you won't retain things that you do not practice,\nand you can't practice things that aren't integrated into what you care about.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\n[2]:

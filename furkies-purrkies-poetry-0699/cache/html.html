  <p>Each time you learn something new,<br>new ideas will come and find you.</p>
  <p>And I would venture,<br>that most times artist learn by adventure.</p>
  <p>They work on their thing,<br>and when done new ideas spring.</p>
  <p>And they keep going round and round,<br>until all the ideas are found.</p>

  <p>And new ideas are found all over,<br>from snowy mountains to a perfect clover.</p>
  <p>One may start with doddles, pico projectors and stencils,<br>and suddenly they discover they mastered pencils.</p>
  <p>It is not just things they hold in your hand,<br>it is a million things that are unplanned.</p>
  <p>For example sticker slapping,<br>slapping, until all the stickers are overlapping.</p>

  <p>It is subtle at first,<br>but before long there comes a burst.</p>
  <p>"And then all of a sudden she collecting hey,<br>to mix it real good with her clay.</p>
  <p>She's building sculptures that dance,<br>and her artworks are all ever France.</p>
  <p>She's opened up a time portal,<br>and became admired, beloved and immortal."</p>

  <p>And what became a machine for us,<br>was once a work of art of the highest class.</p>
  <p>Be it a flying balloon, or the loom,<br>or the first computer that filled an entire room.</p>
  <p>Those are all works of art,<br>and it is less about being smart, and more about the heart.</p>
  <p>And art does not stop at what we see,<br>it continues growing like a giant Sequoya tree.</p>

  <p>A story is a work of art too,<br>even if all its parts are perfectly true.</p>
  <p>That means regular stories, average ideas, popular inventions, and beautiful daydreams,<br>are a lot more important than it seems.</p>
  <p>Life! is a work of art as well,<br>and how far that beautiful story goes... no one can ever tell.</p>
  <p>If you are not into doodles and art,<br>maybe today, is a good day to start.</p>

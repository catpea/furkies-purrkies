Each time you learn something new,
new ideas will come and find you.
And I would venture,
that most times artist learn by adventure.
They work on their thing,
and when done new ideas spring.
And they keep going round and round,
until all the ideas are found.

And new ideas are found all over,
from snowy mountains to a perfect clover.
One may start with doddles, pico projectors and stencils,
and suddenly they discover they mastered pencils.
It is not just things they hold in your hand,
it is a million things that are unplanned.
For example sticker slapping,
slapping, until all the stickers are overlapping.

It is subtle at first,
but before long there comes a burst.
"And then all of a sudden she collecting hey,
to mix it real good with her clay.
She's building sculptures that dance,
and her artworks are all ever France.
She's opened up a time portal,
and became admired, beloved and immortal."

And what became a machine for us,
was once a work of art of the highest class.
Be it a flying balloon, or the loom,
or the first computer that filled an entire room.
Those are all works of art,
and it is less about being smart, and more about the heart.
And art does not stop at what we see,
it continues growing like a giant Sequoya tree.

A story is a work of art too,
even if all its parts are perfectly true.
That means regular stories, average ideas, popular inventions, and beautiful daydreams,
are a lot more important than it seems.
Life! is a work of art as well,
and how far that beautiful story goes... no one can ever tell.
If you are not into doodles and art,
maybe today, is a good day to start.

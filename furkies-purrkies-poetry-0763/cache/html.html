  <p>Today, I gave myself <a href="https://youtu.be/uViGnooaf8w">20 minutes to paint something</a>,<br>and I am not happy with what I created.</p>
  <p>I am pretty sure if you do a 20 minute speed painting session,<br>you are not going to be too happy either.</p>
  <p>However,<br>how...everrr...</p>
  <p>Speed painting is important especially,<br>when using a semi-transparent reference image over the entire canvas.</p>
  <p>We are given access to each and every detail there is.<br>We are artistic royalty, gushing with perfection.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, for the sake of study,<br>of comprehension of greatness...</p>
  <p>We have to let the paint do the painting,<br>that is what impressionism is about.</p>
  <p>Capturing in some kind of glorious desperation,<br>all the most important details, and then setting the brush down.</p>

  <p>I’ve learned that ears are not too important,<br>that nose, does not need to be perfect.</p>
  <p>That, lips do need extra work,<br>and of course eyes are the most important feature.</p>
  <p>But I also learned that both Hyperrealism and<br>Impressionism are perfectly valid ways of creating a painting.</p>

  <p>I still believe that portraits of real individuals,<br>need to be Hyper-realistic.</p>
  <p>I just don’t want people to be surprised,<br>by the girth of brush strokes.</p>
  <p>I want them to be surprised<br>with a perfected stylized likeness that no photo could ever capture.</p>

  <p>But I am certain that if impressionism was denied to us,<br>if we lived in a Universe where it is looked down upon or illegal.</p>
  <p>We wouldn’t be able to sleep at night,<br>we’d be hard at work breaking the rules and loving the works.</p>

  <p>The first time I saw an impressionist paining,<br>I said to myself that I am looking at a color map.</p>
  <p>At the first impression it was a paint-sketch,<br>carefully marking where all the colors, and shapes go.</p>
  <p>But, that the world considered it a complete work,<br>simply meant to me...</p>
  <p>That the step one to creating a paining,<br>is an art in it self.</p>

  <p>Even though I am unhappy with today’s creation,<br>I know deep down, that for all its flaws, it is complete.</p>

  <p>Can we allow ourselves to create a series of nine impressionist works,<br>and call it done?</p>
  <p>Yes, but you won’t be able to appreciate it completely,<br>until you do it in a single sitting, in a single afternoon.</p>
  <p>Carefully prepare nine photo references first,<br>perhaps from unsplash or reddit gets drawn, but you should take your own photos.</p>
  <p>And it will probably take a bit over three hours,<br>as it is three paintings per hour, but there are always details we miss in haste.</p>
  <p>It takes little to add them,<br>but they make an enormous difference.</p>

  <p>And then, put them on a memory stick,<br>and run like the wind to get them printed out and immediately put them up on a wall in a coffee shop.</p>
  <p>(You might want to ask for permission first,<br>but if nobody is looking...)</p>
  <p>A <a href="https://www.meijerphoto.com/Pricing">nearby supermarket</a> may offer 8x11 prints on standard paper,<br>for just about three bucks, and a dollar store could get you some nice frames for just about a dollar.</p>
  <p>You will need to sign your works, to make it official,<br>just price the series at a $1,000 dollars, negotiable.</p>
  <p>Take some photos for your portfolio, and get some rest,<br>as all that will make for a pretty colorful day.</p>

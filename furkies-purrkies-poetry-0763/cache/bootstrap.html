    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I am pretty sure if you do a 20 minute speed painting session,<br>you are not going to be too happy either.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">However,<br>how...everrr...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Speed painting is important especially,<br>when using a semi-transparent reference image over the entire canvas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We are given access to each and every detail there is.<br>We are artistic royalty, gushing with perfection.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Sometimes, for the sake of study,<br>of comprehension of greatness...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We have to let the paint do the painting,<br>that is what impressionism is about.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Capturing in some kind of glorious desperation,<br>all the most important details, and then setting the brush down.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I’ve learned that ears are not too important,<br>that nose, does not need to be perfect.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That, lips do need extra work,<br>and of course eyes are the most important feature.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But I also learned that both Hyperrealism and<br>Impressionism are perfectly valid ways of creating a painting.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Can we allow ourselves to create a series of nine impressionist works,<br>and call it done?</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Yes, but you won’t be able to appreciate it completely,<br>until you do it in a single sitting, in a single afternoon.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Carefully prepare nine photo references first,<br>perhaps from unsplash or reddit gets drawn, but you should take your own photos.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And it will probably take a bit over three hours,<br>as it is three paintings per hour, but there are always details we miss in haste.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A <a href="https://www.meijerphoto.com/Pricing">nearby supermarket</a> may offer 8x11 prints on standard paper,<br>for just about three bucks, and a dollar store could get you some nice frames for just about a dollar.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You will need to sign your works, to make it official,<br>just price the series at a $1,000 dollars, negotiable.</div>

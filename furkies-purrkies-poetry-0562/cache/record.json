  "text": "The first thing you are going to need,\nis to think about a neat place to exhibit your mathematical art[1].\nThe next is the frames are important,\nthey are expensive, computer generated art demands perfection.\nI think you should start with a pane of glass,\nthen maybe really thin aluminum rails.\nI almost feel like you can't cut them with a saw,\nyou will need to make a rough cut an then file them down at a 45 degree angle.\nYou could consider treating your paper with something that makes it tough,\nand skip glass, just make it flap in the wind, a digital vertical flag.\n\nThen there is paper and printer,\n$100 laser printer could cut it if you had 8x72 paper it would make a nice vertical 6 foot flag.\nBut go to an office print shop and use their blueprint printer,\nit uses standard paper, it is black and white laser.\nYou really want to make something physical,\na traditional creation that can be made available for maybe $10,000.\nI think the ideal solution is a plotter[2],\nthis would become your very own and unique brush.\nBare bone plotters are sometimes sold for $150 to $300[3],\nbut they may require a bunch of work, which could be good.\nPlus, with a plotter you could use multiple color markers,\nor go for color pencils, even.\n--\nWhich brings us to,\ncreating the graphics that you will print.\nI don't like using the words Math, Trigonometry, even Vector,\nbut Math has been stolen from us.\nIt wasn't intentional,\nit is just that teachers don't know what it is, how to use it, and what it is for.\nMath is a library of good ideas,\nperhaps mostly assembled by jittery people that drink way too much coffee.\nTheir creations are abstract,\nbecause works of mathematics are best transported or stored, in their most elegant forms.\n\nTake a look at videos about E=mc2[4],\nit is a simple equation, but a complex story, where you have to consider things such as the fact,\nThat in terms of the universe your weight depends on where you are,\ntherefore you need to use the standardized concept of mass.\nIf all you are taught is the formula,\nwithout the background - this day and age? - it means your teacher is selling your mind for a paycheck.\nWhen they start throwing concepts at you that you covered previously in class,\nto make you stop questioning the class.\nThey do that, because they know they haven't taught you that either,\nand can thus use the shame and blame to dismiss you - also, your teacher can't get fired[5] - they do the dance of the lemons[6].\nDon't fall for the sweet talk,\nteaching is not a job, it is a great honor, and a great privilege - it is just that liars liars out compete the honest people.\n\nYou have to learn to recognize the fraud,\nby analyzing the outcomes, by looking at results.\nBy constantly checking,\nif the class you just took was worth your precious time.\n\nAnd yes I know, to evaluate a class,\nyou need a model, something that you can compare other classes against.\nI am about to show you,\na powerful introduction to Vector math.\nThese three precious videos will also show you how Math is used,\nthat it requires the confines of a computer program.\nMath is beautiful, it is not meant for memorization, it is not meant for paper,\nyour math is to be done in a programming environment, where trivialities such as multiplication and formulas, are done for you so that you can do the real work.\nHere are three classes by by The Nature of Code Channel that I want you to look at:\n1.1 What is a Vector?[7]\n1.2 Vector Math[8]\n1.3 Random Vectors[9]\nThis talks about vectors,\nbut this is actually a real introduction to Mathematics.\nYou don't want to start with scalars,\nthe Golden ration and PI are only that interesting.\nYou want to start one step away from plain Numbers,\nwhere they are applied, where they serve a purpose.\nThese three videos introduce using documentation, they show the ease of object oriented notation,\n\"this.\" by the way is a way to reference variables and functions that are defined in the object that you are in.\n(Otherwise the program would think you are referencing normal variables that aren't in the object.

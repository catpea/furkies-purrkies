  <p>The first thing you are going to need,<br>is to think about a neat place to exhibit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Se0_w0ISYk">your mathematical art</a>.</p>
  <p>The next is the frames are important,<br>they are expensive, computer generated art demands perfection.</p>
  <p>I think you should start with a pane of glass,<br>then maybe really thin aluminum rails.</p>
  <p>I almost feel like you can't cut them with a saw,<br>you will need to make a rough cut an then file them down at a 45 degree angle.</p>
  <p>You could consider treating your paper with something that makes it tough,<br>and skip glass, just make it flap in the wind, a digital vertical flag.</p>

  <p>Then there is paper and printer,<br>$100 laser printer could cut it if you had 8x72 paper it would make a nice vertical 6 foot flag.</p>
  <p>But go to an office print shop and use their blueprint printer,<br>it uses standard paper, it is black and white laser.</p>
  <p>You really want to make something physical,<br>a traditional creation that can be made available for maybe $10,000.</p>
  <p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osrxCp3hGpM">the ideal solution is a plotter</a>,<br>this would become your very own and unique brush.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=pen+plotter">Bare bone plotters are sometimes sold for $150 to $300</a>,<br>but they may require a bunch of work, which could be good.</p>
  <p>Plus, with a plotter you could use multiple color markers,<br>or go for color pencils, even.</p>
  <p>--</p>
  <p>Which brings us to,<br>creating the graphics that you will print.</p>
  <p>I don't like using the words Math, Trigonometry, even Vector,<br>but Math has been stolen from us.</p>
  <p>It wasn't intentional,<br>it is just that teachers don't know what it is, how to use it, and what it is for.</p>
  <p>Math is a library of good ideas,<br>perhaps mostly assembled by jittery people that drink way too much coffee.</p>
  <p>Their creations are abstract,<br>because works of mathematics are best transported or stored, in their most elegant forms.</p>

  <p>Take a look at videos about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKEaK7WNLzM">E=mc2</a>,<br>it is a simple equation, but a complex story, where you have to consider things such as the fact,</p>
  <p>That in terms of the universe your weight depends on where you are,<br>therefore you need to use the standardized concept of mass.</p>
  <p>If all you are taught is the formula,<br>without the background - this day and age? - it means your teacher is selling your mind for a paycheck.</p>
  <p>When they start throwing concepts at you that you covered previously in class,<br>to make you stop questioning the class.</p>
  <p>They do that, because they know they haven't taught you that either,<br>and can thus use the shame and blame to dismiss you - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJO8oFEo530">also, your teacher can't get fired</a> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6uHUx728">they do the dance of the lemons</a>.</p>
  <p>Don't fall for the sweet talk,<br>teaching is not a job, it is a great honor, and a great privilege - it is just that liars liars out compete the honest people.</p>

  <p>You have to learn to recognize the fraud,<br>by analyzing the outcomes, by looking at results.</p>
  <p>By constantly checking,<br>if the class you just took was worth your precious time.</p>

  <p>And yes I know, to evaluate a class,<br>you need a model, something that you can compare other classes against.</p>
  <p>I am about to show you,<br>a powerful introduction to Vector math.</p>
  <p>These three precious videos will also show you how Math is used,<br>that it requires the confines of a computer program.</p>
  <p>Math is beautiful, it is not meant for memorization, it is not meant for paper,<br>your math is to be done in a programming environment, where trivialities such as multiplication and formulas, are done <strong>for you</strong> so that <strong>you</strong> can do the real work.</p>
  <p>Here are three classes by by The Nature of Code Channel that I want you to look at:</p>
  <p>1.1 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKEaK7WNLzM">What is a Vector?</a><br>1.2 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rob0pbE7kks">Vector Math</a><br>1.3 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jupjuq9Jl-M">Random Vectors</a></p>
  <p>This talks about vectors,<br>but this is actually a real introduction to Mathematics.</p>
  <p>You don't want to start with scalars,<br>the Golden ration and PI are only that interesting.</p>
  <p>You want to start one step away from plain Numbers,<br>where they are applied, where they serve a purpose.</p>
  <p>These three videos introduce using documentation, they show the ease of object oriented notation,<br>"this." by the way is a way to reference variables and functions that are defined in the object that you are in.<br>(Otherwise the program would think you are referencing normal variables that aren't in the object. Objects are little spherical worlds.)</p>
  <p>These videos are meant to show you that trivial things are done for you,<br>not just calculations but formulas.</p>
  <p>Such as multiplying three dimensional vertices,<br>which is useful for programmatically creating 3D objects for 3D printers.</p>
  <p>They show you real math,<br>what it is, how it is taught, how to use it, and when to use it.</p>

  <p>And here we arrive at that age old question,<br>"Why do I need math?"</p>
  <p>And to be fair to the youngest students,<br>we are only allow to answer this question with a single, perfectly meaningful, and exceptionally powerful word:</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/">Guggenheim</a></p>
  <p>Your works of art, are to be exhibited at Guggenheim,<br>and <a href="https://www.moma.org/">The Museum of Modern Art</a> and a few other places, if they are prestigious enough.</p>
  <p>Do you know who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reVBAbo5VU8">Yayoi Kusama</a> is?<br>I think of her as the World's Greatest Art Teacher.</p>
  <p>Moreover, it is her work that does the speaking for her,<br>...we are each an artist - our world depends on it.</p>
  <p>I think it is time for you to become an artist too,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R9eywArFTE">start in the beginning</a>, and when you get to the end, keep the machines going, so that others may follow.</p>

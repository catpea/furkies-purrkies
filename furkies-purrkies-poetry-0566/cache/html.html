  <p>Who knows why we are born with an ember and not aglow with a fire,<br>why to wisdom me must choose to aspire.</p>
  <p>Maybe because we are each to light the fire on our own,<br>maybe we need to wait until we are fully grown.</p>
  <p>Maybe it is just that it is a choice,<br>but it is good that we can all have a voice.</p>
  <p>Whatever the reasons, to make it burn or leave it glow,<br>there is something that each of us should know.</p>

  <p>Decisions that deal with our soul,<br>require that we witness nature whole.</p>
  <p>And that means,<br>you need to set aside machines and computer screens.</p>
  <p>And you don't just go into the mountains, but also is must snow,<br>and the cold wind should also blow.</p>
  <p>You don't need to cross the mountains to learn to see,<br>just like you don't have swim across the sea.</p>
  <p>A cabin will do,<br>and grab a fine boat for the oceans too.</p>
  <p>And be prepared to sail to a real island,<br>better yet, just as soon as you descend down from the highland.</p>
  <p>And yes you need to see the desert too,<br>anyone of them will do.</p>
  <p>It would be best if the cacti flowered for you,<br>I hope you understand, I hope you do.</p>

  <p>We take care of nature, and she takes care of us,<br>it is not even that big of a fuss.</p>
  <p>We should all know that<br>the office is only good for a few years, so much for that diploma and a hat.</p>
  <p>Greatness isn't really optional anymore,<br>it is just not very nice to ask for.</p>
  <p>We need to grant ourselves a real education,<br>no matter what city, state or nation.</p>
  <p>And then we need Wisdom to grow from that,<br>and then greatness to follow, no matter what.</p>
  <p>It is time for Humanity to emphasize learning to see,<br>to see the nature, the nurture and the future, that it all just a delicate tree.</p>

  <p>There is something I must ask you to do,<br>prepare a backpack, you can tell yourself it is not even for you.</p>
  <p>And keep it right by the door,<br>it may take a week or two, or four.</p>
  <p>But eventually, on a day full of pointless overwork and woe,<br>you'll just grab it, and go.</p>

  <p>The backpack is a contract with nature, and the stars,<br>and it is purely about your wisdom and your memoirs.</p>
  <p>Your journals of day to day adventure,<br>as you take to the arms of Mother Nature.</p>
  <p>She will light your glowing ember,<br>even if it is damp and drizzly November, and especially if it is deep and dark December,</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Get a hold of the trail</a>,<br>even if you think you are going to fail.</p>
  <p>Fill a journal after journal from the mountains to the sea,<br>may your wisdom set the world free, and grow, grow endlessly.</p>

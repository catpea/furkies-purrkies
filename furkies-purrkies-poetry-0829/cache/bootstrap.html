    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We are tolerating an overwhelming number of errors in our cultures and minds,<br>and it is those error that slowly fracture or unravel otherwise brilliant minds.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The biggest error we are tolerating is war, military service, and weapons manufacturing,<br>weapons of mass destruction which are developed to destroy entire city blocks.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But there are countless others, there are so many of them, that people lose their minds,<br>grades are a mistake, because we are all equally smart.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even saying “Oh, he is an amazing artist” is a horrible mistake,<br>because all it takes to become an artist is a series of tutorials, not some imaginary genius.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The little star stickers in kindergarten are as stupid,<br>as the same kinds of starts that we hand to bat-shit crazy murderous generals.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Blind obedience is part of the problem,<br>the world needs wisdom and brilliant flourishing minds.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In our weakness, out of being overwhelmed, confused, tricked to serve,<br>blood sucking parasite ghouls that promise free money for college that should be free...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We are all under the influence of this crushing confusion and broken promises,<br>for example, for many decades we have known about climate change - but we have done nothing, absolute minimum, is nothing.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You need to correctly distribute food, and provide powerful universal basic income,<br>that will help the local economies flourish in ways that not even the best politicians could arrange for.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Politics, is just a game of who is who, and name recognition,<br>and kindergarten star stickers, a game of lies, death and misery.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Political culture is not that far off from slavery, just look at prisons and the second part of the 13th amendment,<br>it is not that far off from mass killings, just look a the military recruiting teenagers.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Politics is an old culture, that will only ever let you build a house of cards,<br>to be blown away when the dictators run out o armies to fight for their anti-depressant induced fantasies.</div>

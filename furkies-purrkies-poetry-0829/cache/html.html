  <p>The world is meant to be a safe and happy place, and human beings are not born evil,<br>the worst things you read about on the news, have a very clear explanation.</p>
  <p>We are tolerating an overwhelming number of errors in our cultures and minds,<br>and it is those error that slowly fracture or unravel otherwise brilliant minds.</p>
  <p>The biggest error we are tolerating is war, military service, and weapons manufacturing,<br>weapons of mass destruction which are developed to destroy entire city blocks.</p>
  <p>But there are countless others, there are so many of them, that people lose their minds,<br>grades are a mistake, because we are all equally smart.</p>
  <p>Even saying “Oh, he is an amazing artist” is a horrible mistake,<br>because all it takes to become an artist is a series of tutorials, not some imaginary genius.</p>
  <p>The little star stickers in kindergarten are as stupid,<br>as the same kinds of starts that we hand to bat-shit crazy murderous generals.</p>
  <p>Blind obedience is part of the problem,<br>the world needs wisdom and brilliant flourishing minds.</p>
  <p>In our weakness, out of being overwhelmed, confused, tricked to serve,<br>blood sucking parasite ghouls that promise free money for college that should be free...</p>
  <p>We are all under the influence of this crushing confusion and broken promises,<br>for example, for many decades we have known about climate change - but we have done nothing, absolute minimum, is nothing.</p>

  <p>There is a way to stop this,<br>and that is to grow up knowing that tolerating all those crazy mistakes...</p>
  <p>Is a way, to get us, to serve all the lying parasitic ghouls,<br>that manipulated their way into politics, all around the world.</p>
  <p>It won’t be until it is too late,<br>that you will realize war and politics never changes.</p>

  <p>If you can just stop tolerating errors and mistakes,<br>from poverty to fake schools, then you can change the world.</p>
  <p>Your generation will need clear to understand visual programming based software,<br>that will automatically manage neighborhoods, cities, states, and later nations.</p>
  <p>You need to correctly distribute food, and provide powerful universal basic income,<br>that will help the local economies flourish in ways that not even the best politicians could arrange for.</p>
  <p>Politics, is just a game of who is who, and name recognition,<br>and kindergarten star stickers, a game of lies, death and misery.</p>
  <p>Political culture is not that far off from slavery, just look at prisons and the second part of the 13th amendment,<br>it is not that far off from mass killings, just look a the military recruiting teenagers.</p>
  <p>Politics is an old culture, that will only ever let you build a house of cards,<br>to be blown away when the dictators run out o armies to fight for their anti-depressant induced fantasies.</p>

  <p>It has always been about you stepping on the politicians,<br>rising so far above them, that they will bellow in mad laughter at heir own damn selves and their wasted lives.</p>
  <p>You have to write the program, that will help humanity rise above the liars,<br>the killings, the slavery, the recruitment of children into military, and manufacturing of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
  <p>Your generation, cannot rely on the politics of the previous, because, all of it is wrong,<br>that’s why you can’t find any one singe thing to fix, because it is all the things.</p>
  <p>Chances are that you have already accepted some of the madness...<br>grades perhaps.</p>
  <p>Without thinking too much about it,<br>you might have already accepted they are a measure of your intelligence.</p>
  <p>Though at the same time, you were not really learning,<br>just repeating and memorizing like everyone else.</p>
  <p>You might have already accepted bullies as a fact of life,<br>you don’t know to call the police, maybe because you don’t want their fathers to beat them even more.</p>
  <p>But you need to stop, stop assuming that the things you can’t understand are correct,<br>you need to stop right now, before the countless mistakes start unraveling your mind too.</p>

  <p>The world that you were born into is an impossible to understand mesh work of mistakes,<br>and when you accept them as reality, nothing will ever make sense, ever again.</p>
  <p>Rather than believing in whatever culture you were born into,<br>or the politics of whatever country, religion, or family you were born into.</p>
  <p>Take to the books held in the highest esteem by all the worlds intellectuals,<br>and grow up in the culture of understanding, instead.</p>
  <p>Do not propagate the mesh work of mistakes, forward,<br>to grow up means to grow all the way up, until you become a great being.</p>

  <p>So as long as leaders are moving along,<br>generations wont seem that long.</p>
  <p>Few years here, few years there,<br>and you will have to make repair.</p>

  <p>The world will grow up all right,<br>eventually even reaching its maximum height.</p>
  <p>That is how it goes,<br>so as long as everybody knows.</p>
  <p>We are all extremely smart,<br>and our lives are meant to unfold like art.</p>
  <p>That we are meant to become wise,<br>no matter how many tries.</p>

  <p>But we can't pretend,<br>as that can only lead to a sad end.</p>
  <p>All the politicians must be great,<br>as it is time to put an end to hate.</p>
  <p>It is not the world that must unite,<br>it is only the children that have to get that right.</p>
  <p>The adults will be gone soon enough,<br>they are not even that tough.</p>
  <p>The world has always belonged to the children,<br>proven time and again.</p>

  <p>The politicians are pushed to pretend,<br>and they won't care to what end.</p>
  <p>They may just sit there babbling blind,<br>and won't even notice the unraveling of their mind.</p>
  <p>They won't look very far ahead,<br>they just want to look good instead.</p>
  <p>"Do as little as possible" - they say,<br>and then leave the office promptly on their last day.</p>
  <p>This should make them look crazy and strange,<br>because we need real change.</p>

  <p>What the world really needs,<br>is great deeds.</p>

  <p>All it takes to start,<br>is listening to interesting books and getting adventure-smart.</p>

  <p>Before you know it you become wise,<br>and continue to rise.</p>
  <p>You don't have give speeches to great ovation,<br>you just need to help the younger generation.</p>
  <p>This way you are not just an army of one,<br>buy inspire everyone.</p>

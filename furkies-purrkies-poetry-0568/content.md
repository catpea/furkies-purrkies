"A king may make a nobleman,
but he cannot make a gentleman." -- Edmund Burke

"A school that is fake,
is one that does not a great being make." -- Dr... Meow.

So as long as leaders are moving along,
generations wont seem that long.

Few years here, few years there,
and you will have to make repair.

So you you got to grow up fast,
and make sure your contributions last.

---

The world will grow up all right,
eventually even reaching its maximum height.

That is how it goes,
so as long as everybody knows.

We are all extremely smart,
and our lives are meant to unfold like art.

That we are meant to become wise,
no matter how many tries.

---

But we can't pretend,
as that can only lead to a sad end.

All the politicians must be great,
as it is time to put an end to hate.

It is not the world that must unite,
it is only the children that have to get that right.

The adults will be gone soon enough,
they are not even that tough.

The world has always belonged to the children,
proven time and again.

---

The politicians are pushed to pretend,
and they won't care to what end.

They may just sit there babbling blind,
and won't even notice the unraveling of their mind.

They won't look very far ahead,
they just want to look good instead.

"Do as little as possible" - they say,
and then leave the office promptly on their last day.

This should make them look crazy and strange,
because we need real change.

---

Fake schools made us all forget we are smart,
then we forgot that life was art.

We move to cities in search of diplomas and careers,
then we watch years pass-us-by in tears.

---

What the world really needs,
is great deeds.

Each life is to be a sensation,
and serve as great inspiration.

That is how we get really educated,
and that is how true leaders are created.

---

And with true and wise leaders abound,
a new age of enlightenment will come around.

Then, the liars and the sleazy,
won't have it so easy.

We'll sort short from long visions apart,
and regain the use of our heart.

---

All it takes to start,
is listening to interesting books and getting adventure-smart.

(Books, is all it takes,
to spot all the damn crooks.)

Then you take to adventure and live,
and stand up to the crooks and never forgive.

Before you know it you become wise,
and continue to rise.

You don't have give speeches to great ovation,
you just need to help the younger generation.

This way you are not just an army of one,
buy inspire everyone.

Including those who like politics,
which makes for a easy fix.

---

The world must learn to stand guard against fakes,
and do whatever it takes.

The younger generations need real schools and rel politics,
we must put an end to the circus tricks.

So as long as their world is fair,
they'll take it from there.

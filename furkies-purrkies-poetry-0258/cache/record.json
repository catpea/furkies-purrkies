  "text": "When you drive long enough,\nyou will inevitably find yourself far away from everything.\n\nNow, you have to be courageous,\nas first few days are going to be filled with doubt.\n\nOnce you get through it,\nand the daily stresses let go of you, you will become you.\n\nAnd if you give it long enough,\nyou'll find yourself wondering how you got here.\n\nThe answer is almost always,\n\"By making excuses for people, that didn't deserve them.\"\n\nThis falls back on judging people by that age,\nand not by their wisdom, class, and maturity.\n\nAnybody can age,\nbut the pursuit of wisdom is a great challenge.\n\nJust as soon as you stop making excuses,\nas you stop filling in the blanks, you are placed on a path towards wisdom.\n\nWhile you do need your books,\nand narrated books are best, the journey is also very important.\n\nYou can't hear the wisdom of a book,\nuntil you get on that path.\n\nAnd let me precisely state what that path is,\nso that there is no room for confusion here.\n\nIt is,\nThe Path Of Adventure.\n\nI was sitting in my coffee shop,\nI went there because it once had Tolstoy on the bookshelves.\n\nBut, I've noticed that things have changed,\nand people were not growing up, they were running in circles, curving inwards.\n\nI sat in the rocking chair,\nit was the first time, it felt nice.\n\nI rose,\nand made it to Tennessee.\n\nI could feel the Spirit of Adventure,\nbut there was this enormous responsibility to help people grow.\n\nI was too young to be heard,\nthough I have a faint memory of someone calling me Mother Hen somewhere.\n\nGeorgia, I made it to Georgia next,\nbut instead of turning around, I slept at a rest area.\n\nI woke up, and kept going,\nuntil the highways I was on, turned to US Highway One.\n\nI pulled up by the beautiful beach,\nand I walked into the Amazing and warm Ocean.\n\nStanding On The Edge Of The Universe,\nI called it.\n\nIt was wonderful,\nthe stars came out, I've noticed little glowy fishes swimming about.\n\nOn my way pack,\nI shout right past my city, and kept on driving.\n\nAnd yet again I ended up on another beach,\nthis time in Ludington, Michigan.\n\nHere I overheard someone mention,\nNordhouse Dunes.\n\nI set off immediate, I've never seen dunes that big before,\nthey looked like mountains, to me.\n\nI begun sleeping at a different campsite each day,\nthen I discovered a little dune that reminded me of a volcano.\n\nAnd I have spent many days there,\nI have listened to many audio books on top of my little volcano.\n\nI discovered how much there is to wisdom,\nand what is more, that most of our wisdom has to come from within us.\n\nDaily stresses, and unimportant worries,\ntrying to speak to people who never listen, is not healthy.\n\nBefore we try to help others grow,\nwe must become wise, and much, much older.\n\nPeople must be ready to listen,\nbefore they can hear and comprehend what you are sharing.\n\nExpress your concern for others,\nbut not by being pulled into problems of people that don't listen.\n\nWrite, and narrate your books, write to those who are searching for wisdom,\nand you will be heard and adored the world over.\n\nNow, go set off on your beautiful adventure,\nmay you discover all the wisdom and fathom more.",

  "text": "What if the new school format is right in front of us[1],\nwe don't need tests that are secure and vicious, because we are not forcing anything.\nWe are simply creating a new school full of knowledge,\nguidance on the left pane, the machine that must be manipulated in the right pane.\nAnd all the way down on the bottom of all instructions,\na next button disabled until the machine is correctly manipulated.\n\nThere is no need for security, enabling that button by force,\nwould prevent the student from progressing in the panes that follow.\n\nAnd listen to this, the student is not timed, there is no graduation,\nthere are no grades, there is no punishment.\nStudents are encouraged to gather at libraries,\nwhere they can be treated with respect.\n\nSome of the tutorials will result in products that can make money,\nit can be as simple as building a new website theme.\nWhere the student would pay attention to color, clip art,\ndocumentation, new components, white-space and integrity of the design.\nOr as challenging as creating new phone applications,\nthat do useful and interesting things while protecting privacy for example.\n\nThere is no graduation, there is no diploma,\nbut there is a path they have traveled through this tree of knowledge.\nIt is not necessarily true that longest or most branching paths are best,\nstudent activity it self is a good indicator of health and success.\n\nI want students to be paid for grades,\nand to be paid for each hour of instruction about five times the minimum wage.\nBut I think that is something Humanity will be ready for in,\n900 years - today Humanity is too far behind.\n\nUntil then, we have to help the students to learn,\nhow to create products for sale.\nThat will be the reward that this school offers,\nnot only do they sell a products while taking these courses.\nBut they of course gain the ability,\nto create non-tutorialized products.\n\nThe question here is how unique are these products,\nthey are perfectly unique.\nThe school marketplace has a posting board,\nwhere customers can request program components.\nThe component breakdown ensures that the poster,\ndefines a well thought out request.\nImagine that they can post a bounty between $100 and $1,000 dollars,\nhere they will want their component to fit that budget.\nThey will also be tasked with creating a unit test,\nthat tests if their component works as requested.\nNow imagine that eleven students apply to fulfill that request,\nas part of their education.\nWhen the due date is reached,\nthe test will reject those entries that fail the test.\nThe students can see the failing tests as they program,\nso for a well defined request it will be rare to fail.\nLets assume all eleven students pass the automated unit test,\nnow the original poster will have to pick the best work.\nAll eleven students receive the experience, the education, and portfolio entry,\nbut the one winner gets the big monetary payout.\nThey will take home, $900.00 dollars 90% percent of what the poster will pay,\nthe other 10% percent goes to the other students as a symbolic reward.\nThere maybe a reasonable fee for making that post,\nwhich will go to the school it self, but the school is an Open Company that publishes where the money goes, and where all the other money comes from.\nThey each receive $10 dollars, and proceeded to make fun of the whole ordeal,\nand greatly though in good spirits complain; how terribly unfair this school is.\n\nThere is always that one student that is not happy her work didn't win,\nand I agree that it is extremely --- unfair, and that she should be enraged.\nNow what you don't realize, is that this imaginary young lady,\nholds the keys to the upgraded version of this school.\nHer magnificent rage will not go to waste,\nshe will make it better.\nAll we need to do, is to build this first imperfect and unfair version,\nand she'll take it from there.\n\nThe question that we are left here with,\ncan students learn mathematics, physics, chemistry and art from this school?\nI think the answer is yes,\nso as long as the right hand pane is a powerful interactive application.\nAnd the creators of these applications,\nwill be other students.\nI think these applications represent contributions to humanity,\nas great as landing a human on the moon.\nTheir names will be proudly,\nattached to the applications they help to create and update.\n\nI will close with an example of learning about music this way,\nthey are almost perfect examples of what this school would feel like.\nThe first and richest of the two is Learning Music at Ableton[2],\nand the second more technical is Learning Synths, also at Ableton[3].\n3Blue1Brown[4] Educational Chanel shows the power of visualization,\nin regard to mathematics, however there is a subtle problem here.\nBecause approaching mathematics with the standard language pf mathematics,\ncreates an extra translation step, at least at first.\nInitially mathematical notation must be converted to a programming language[5],\nwhere it is much more useful.\nThis will grant the students the power to create interactive visualizations[6],\non par with 3Blue1Brown.\nAn advanced class, will present the students with Blender Tutorials[7] here,\nthey will be able to upload their geometry and sell it in the school marketplace.\n\nI think the most valuable asset for sale are tutorial videos,\nand live support, or tutoring.\nThere is enough here to help students out of poverty,\nmay this school be always be open, and always free.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics\n[2]: https://learningmusic.ableton.com/\n[3]: https://learningsynths.ableton.com/\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown\n[5]: https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYQVlVoWoPY\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+tutorial",

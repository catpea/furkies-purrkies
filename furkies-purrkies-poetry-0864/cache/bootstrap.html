    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That will be the reward that this school offers,<br>not only do they sell a products while taking these courses.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The question here is how unique are these products,<br>they are perfectly unique.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The school marketplace has a posting board,<br>where customers can request program components.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The component breakdown ensures that the poster,<br>defines a well thought out request.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Imagine that they can post a bounty between $100 and $1,000 dollars,<br>here they will want their component to fit that budget.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They will also be tasked with creating a unit test,<br>that tests if their component works as requested.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Now imagine that eleven students apply to fulfill that request,<br>as part of their education.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When the due date is reached,<br>the test will reject those entries that fail the test.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The students can see the failing tests as they program,<br>so for a well defined request it will be rare to fail.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Lets assume all eleven students pass the automated unit test,<br>now the original poster will have to pick the best work.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">All eleven students receive the experience, the education, and portfolio entry,<br>but the one winner gets the big monetary payout.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They will take home, $900.00 dollars 90% percent of what the poster will pay,<br>the other 10% percent goes to the other students as a symbolic reward.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There maybe a reasonable fee for making that post,<br>which will go to the school it self, but the school is an Open Company that publishes where the money goes, and where all the other money comes from.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They each receive $10 dollars, and proceeded to make fun of the whole ordeal,<br>and greatly though in good spirits complain; how terribly unfair this school is.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because approaching mathematics with the standard language pf mathematics,<br>creates an extra translation step, at least at first.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Initially <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">mathematical notation must be converted to a programming language</a>,<br>where it is much more useful.</div>

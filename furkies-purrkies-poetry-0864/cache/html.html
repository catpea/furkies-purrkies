  <p>What if <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics">the new school format is right in front of us</a>,<br>we don't need tests that are secure and vicious, because we are not forcing anything.</p>
  <p>We are simply creating a new school full of knowledge,<br>guidance on the left pane, the machine that must be manipulated in the right pane.</p>
  <p>And all the way down on the bottom of all instructions,<br>a next button disabled until the machine is correctly manipulated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

  <p>There is no need for security, enabling that button by force,<br>would prevent the student from progressing in the panes that follow.</p>

  <p>And listen to this, the student is not timed, there is no graduation,<br>there are no grades, there is no punishment.</p>
  <p>Students are encouraged to gather at libraries,<br>where they can be treated with respect.</p>

  <p>Some of the tutorials will result in products that can make money,<br>it can be as simple as building a new website theme.</p>
  <p>Where the student would pay attention to color, clip art,<br>documentation, new components, white-space and integrity of the design.</p>
  <p>Or as challenging as creating new phone applications,<br>that do useful and interesting things while protecting privacy for example.</p>

  <p>There is no graduation, there is no diploma,<br>but there is a path they have traveled through this tree of knowledge.</p>
  <p>It is not necessarily true that longest or most branching paths are best,<br>student activity it self is a good indicator of health and success.</p>

  <p>I want students to be paid for grades,<br>and to be paid for each hour of instruction about five times the minimum wage.</p>
  <p>But I think that is something Humanity will be ready for in,<br>900 years - today Humanity is too far behind.</p>

  <p>Until then, we have to help the students to learn,<br>how to create products for sale.</p>
  <p>That will be the reward that this school offers,<br>not only do they sell a products while taking these courses.</p>
  <p>But they of course gain the ability,<br>to create non-tutorialized products.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>The question here is how unique are these products,<br>they are perfectly unique.</p>
  <p>The school marketplace has a posting board,<br>where customers can request program components.</p>
  <p>The component breakdown ensures that the poster,<br>defines a well thought out request.</p>
  <p>Imagine that they can post a bounty between $100 and $1,000 dollars,<br>here they will want their component to fit that budget.</p>
  <p>They will also be tasked with creating a unit test,<br>that tests if their component works as requested.</p>
  <p>Now imagine that eleven students apply to fulfill that request,<br>as part of their education.</p>
  <p>When the due date is reached,<br>the test will reject those entries that fail the test.</p>
  <p>The students can see the failing tests as they program,<br>so for a well defined request it will be rare to fail.</p>
  <p>Lets assume all eleven students pass the automated unit test,<br>now the original poster will have to pick the best work.</p>
  <p>All eleven students receive the experience, the education, and portfolio entry,<br>but the one winner gets the big monetary payout.</p>
  <p>They will take home, $900.00 dollars 90% percent of what the poster will pay,<br>the other 10% percent goes to the other students as a symbolic reward.</p>
  <p>There maybe a reasonable fee for making that post,<br>which will go to the school it self, but the school is an Open Company that publishes where the money goes, and where all the other money comes from.</p>
  <p>They each receive $10 dollars, and proceeded to make fun of the whole ordeal,<br>and greatly though in good spirits complain; how terribly unfair this school is.</p>

  <p>There is always that one student that is not happy her work didn't win,<br>and I agree that it is extremely <em>-------------</em> unfair, and that she should be enraged.</p>
  <p>Now what you don't realize, is that this imaginary young lady,<br>holds the keys to the upgraded version of this school.</p>
  <p>Her magnificent rage will not go to waste,<br>she will make it better.</p>
  <p>All we need to do, is to build this first imperfect and unfair version,<br>and she'll take it from there.</p>

  <p>The question that we are left here with,<br>can students learn mathematics, physics, chemistry and art from this school?</p>
  <p>I think the answer is yes,<br>so as long as the right hand pane is a powerful interactive application.</p>
  <p>And the creators of these applications,<br>will be other students.</p>
  <p>I think these applications represent contributions to humanity,<br>as great as landing a human on the moon.</p>
  <p>Their names will be proudly,<br>attached to the applications they help to create and update.</p>

  <p>I will close with an example of learning about music this way,<br>they are almost perfect examples of what this school would feel like.</p>
  <p>The first and richest of the two is <a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/">Learning Music at Ableton</a>,<br>and the second more technical is <a href="https://learningsynths.ableton.com/">Learning Synths, also at Ableton</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a> Educational Chanel shows the power of visualization,<br>in regard to mathematics, however there is a subtle problem here.</p>
  <p>Because approaching mathematics with the standard language pf mathematics,<br>creates an extra translation step, at least at first.</p>
  <p>Initially <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">mathematical notation must be converted to a programming language</a>,<br>where it is much more useful.</p>
  <p>This will grant the students <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYQVlVoWoPY">the power to create interactive visualizations</a>,<br>on par with 3Blue1Brown.</p>
  <p>An advanced class, will present the students with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+tutorial">Blender Tutorials</a> here,<br>they will be able to upload their geometry and sell it in the school marketplace.</p>

  <p>I think the most valuable asset for sale are tutorial videos,<br>and live support, or tutoring.</p>
  <p>There is enough here to help students out of poverty,<br>may this school be always be open, and always free.</p>

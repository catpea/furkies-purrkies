rhyme.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There are many types of poems,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but little rhyming ones are always cheerful and loving.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And because you can only say what rhymes,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you get to include extras, that you wouldn't normally think of.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">For example,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">here is a little poem about strange mini-adventures.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There is something lovely and strange,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">when going out for a jog or a walk for a change.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If it is early morning and before the sun comes out,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it will be a fascinating workout.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If it is late at night,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it will feel like running at the speed of light.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And just going our for a walk is also great,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because it is a heck of a way to concentrate.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I think of poems as little dreams,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they just meander their own way, and that is OK.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I prefer writing two lines,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">where both of the endings rhyme.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Some people like an even odd scheme,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">where first rhymes with third, and second with fourth.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And sometimes people pay attention to the rhythm of the line it self,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that can be very good practice for song making.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">By far the best method in my opinion,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is to write on a commuter.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Because here you can easily edit lines,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and quickly look up rhymes.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But, you should also keep a paper journal,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">where you write down your favorite poems, and rhymes.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And above all, and this is really, really important,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you have to record your voice, or make a video of you reading your poems.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Recording your recitations truly is a huge part or poetry,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you can just cover the camera if you are uncomfortable with full video.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Lets try another poem,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">this one is about boo boo, a barking dog I often say hello to during my spring jogs.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Though I love the singing birds and frogs,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I don't really make many friends on my jogs.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But there is this one dog that really barks,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I always mutter, ah-a! a bite like that will leave some marks.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But as soon as I speed up with a frown,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">he seems to somewhat, calm down.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I think he barks because he is bored,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and as far as strangers go his barks often go ignored.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And here I come breathlessly chugging along,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">sometimes doing little dances to my song.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And I think he barks because that entertains him,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that I try so hard to be slim.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I try to show him I am a gentleman and I wave,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">in hopes that he does not misbehave.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And, I gave him a name too,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I call him Boo-Boo.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">After what I'd probably get if he got his wish,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and got off of his leash.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Even, the tiniest idea can become a funny and somewhat lengthy poem,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">as you go round an round searching for rhymes.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Poems can be really good at helping you remember something neat,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">like the sound that frogs made one day, or a barking dog.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Without trying to rhyme,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the story would be one sentence long, and soon forgotten.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">With a poem,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it just keeps going bark and bark.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I should also mention,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that there is this classy way of speaking about things, by subtle analogy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Instead of writing a poem that mentions your favorite philosophers,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">mention flower names, or planets, or star names instead.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And as a result you end up with a book of poetry,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">about something seemingly ordinary, but also one that hides a profound wisdom.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">For example, Philosophers are fond or saying,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">\"Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel\".</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Aster, is a kind of flower that symbolizes,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Wisdom, Faith, and Valor, and the word comes from Greek and means star.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The word planets also has its roots in the Greek planētes asteres,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">meaning \"wandering stars\" and in this case, a wandering student.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom:

understand it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Too many planets and stars,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and no Aster could ever stand up to vengeful Mars.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We mustn't hope to fill the vessel but to kindle a flame,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we can only hope to give the stars an

tradition here,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">right after the melody is done playing turn off your beat, drums and base, just for a second.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Let us make a very simple and minimalist song,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that touches upon the more important components of techno.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The special thing about this song is that it will capture the progress of making it self,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so as we start you will only hear the sub layer, because the sub layer is the first thing we will work on.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We will then add the mid layer,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and you will hear that as the song plays, you will hear the sub layer enriched with the mid layer, and so on.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Sub Bass Layer, is a low and boring pattern at first,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but once we get to the drum and hats we are going to mess it up, and our song will become richer for it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Here is the simple version:</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">* SOUND OF SUB BASS *</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now the Mid Bass Layer, it is a little bit more complex, and more notes are going to be hit,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">these are very machine like sounds you can hear the electricity here.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I think this is the most memorable part of hearing techno for the first time,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I thought to my self when I was little \"that is the electronic in electronic music\".</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">* MID BASS *</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now that three is something going on in our ears,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">now that we are sure our song will not be empty between the drums.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We add a pronounced drum, and we have to make sure to space everything out,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so that our bass is not covered by the drum, we want out the sounds coming through.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I grew up with shorter sounding drums,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">ones powered by electricity and controlled by good old knobs.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Here is what the song sounds like with our snappy drums now,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">* DRUM *</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now we have a song going, we got bass we got drums,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">personally at this point I would add hats with a shaker to blend them in, kind of serve as an echo.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But instead we are going to warp the sub bass layer to give our song a sub pattern,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I want you to hear it nice and clear.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In the first half of the sample that is about to play the the sub bass plays in a perfect sequence,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">in the second half you'll hear something come out of control.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Even though we only have sub bass, mid bass and drums, it sounds like something else is going on.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">* SUB BASS VARIATION *</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now we add hats to make the song come alive, to get that main energy,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it is not always best to add the shaker at the same time.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The shaker is basically the hat echo effect,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and if we have a clean melody, we may only wish to hear crisp hats.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So let us add the shaker separately in the next step,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">here are the hats:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">* HAT INTRODUCTION *</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And now let us add the shaker,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I like my shaker short.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">* SHAKER DEMONSTRATION *</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now let us add a simple melody as the main lead,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there is no trick to it just find whatever you like.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">* MELODY *</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is one of my favorites, it comes from <span>Chopin's Étude Op. 10, No. 12<sup>[2]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">also known as the Revolutionary Étude.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">At fist I start of with a short snippet that leaves the listener wanting,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and then then I expand with a slightly sharper and longer variation that you heard here.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is my go to song when I am studying something,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">my music teacher made it so that I would hate Chopin, but I failed that class.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is important that you reach out to big names for ideas,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">beautiful songs are great teachers, and we should all learn from the best.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Teachers that make us pretend to learn by forcing us to memorize under a threat of repeating a year,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">are just frauds.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If there is one thing that you take away from this tutorial it should be that you are a genius,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and that greatness is not a privilege for the lucky few.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

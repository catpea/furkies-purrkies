Whenever we ask,
why didn't they just fight back.

The answer is,
because they didn't know what to fight for.

It is the oldest trick in the book,
keep people inside invisible prisons by hiding the beauty of the real world from them.

This has been used by the worst kind of people,
and Humanity has gone a long way to almost fix that.

But there is another thing,
because lack of knowing, is also a __symptom__ of poverty.

[Cycles of poverty][1] can only be broken
by real education, and universal income.

---

We can't hope to advance the Human Kind,
while keeping the entire world in the social and political construct of poverty.

It is OK, to agree to use the concept of money,
so as long as there is no poverty.

Otherwise it is not OK,
because it hurts people, it keep them in the dark.

This can't be fixed by welfare,
this must be built into the concept of money.

A credit card with a very reasonable daily spending limit,
that anybody can request.

It is just a piece of plastic,
connected to a special bank that does not keep track of debt or funds.

All such a card does,
is remove poverty.

It doesn't cause national debt,
because that bank does not track that number.

It only causes the elimination of poverty,
and almost all crime, and most suffering, and fear, and unfairness.

And it helps store and business owners grow their businesses,
as they now have customers who aren't afraid of going hungry.

This little piece of plastic, doesn't hurt economy,
it helps it steadily grow.

---

Whatever stands in Humanity's way to growing up,
must be wisely removed.

We are one family,
and nothing should stand in our way to growing up, especially poverty.

Poverty is just as evil as all the other evil things,
it must end, because it is hurting us.

People who argue for poverty,
are simply victims of uneducation, victims of never having known joy and peace.

There cannot be a rational argument,
to keep ourselves in poverty.

---

We are one family, together we are extremely powerful,
and nothing must to stand in our way of growing up.

Let us learn to keep track of the things that prevent real education,
some will be man made, others an emergent property of chaos.

Let us become Knowledgeable, let us become more aware of fake or ineffective education.
the Future Generations, and all the Future of Human Kind, depends on us.

Depends on each generation,
that came before them.

We aren't just connected as one family today,
we are also connected across all time, from the past to the future.

It matters,
what we do.

It matters whether or not we notice,
the evil of poverty.

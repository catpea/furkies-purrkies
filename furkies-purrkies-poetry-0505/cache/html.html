  <p>Whenever we ask,<br>why didn't they just fight back.</p>
  <p>The answer is,<br>because they didn't know what to fight for.</p>
  <p>It is the oldest trick in the book,<br>keep people inside invisible prisons by hiding the beauty of the real world from them.</p>
  <p>This has been used by the worst kind of people,<br>and Humanity has gone a long way to almost fix that.</p>

  <p>But there is another thing,<br>because lack of knowing, is also a <strong>symptom</strong> of poverty.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvlozhvQPJw">Cycles of poverty</a> can only be broken<br>by real education, and universal income.</p>

  <p>We can't hope to advance the Human Kind,<br>while keeping the entire world in the social and political construct of poverty.</p>
  <p>It is OK, to agree to use the concept of money,<br>so as long as there is no poverty.</p>
  <p>Otherwise it is not OK,<br>because it hurts people, it keep them in the dark.</p>
  <p>This can't be fixed by welfare,<br>this must be built into the concept of money.</p>
  <p>A credit card with a very reasonable daily spending limit,<br>that anybody can request.</p>
  <p>It is just a piece of plastic,<br>connected to a special bank that does not keep track of debt or funds.</p>
  <p>All such a card does,<br>is remove poverty.</p>
  <p>It doesn't cause national debt,<br>because that bank does not track that number.</p>
  <p>It only causes the elimination of poverty,<br>and almost all crime, and most suffering, and fear, and unfairness.</p>
  <p>And it helps store and business owners grow their businesses,<br>as they now have customers who aren't afraid of going hungry.</p>
  <p>This little piece of plastic, doesn't hurt economy,<br>it helps it steadily grow.</p>

  <p>Whatever stands in Humanity's way to growing up,<br>must be wisely removed.</p>
  <p>We are one family,<br>and nothing should stand in our way to growing up, especially poverty.</p>
  <p>Poverty is just as evil as all the other evil things,<br>it must end, because it is hurting us.</p>
  <p>People who argue for poverty,<br>are simply victims of uneducation, victims of never having known joy and peace.</p>
  <p>There cannot be a rational argument,<br>to keep ourselves in poverty.</p>

  <p>We are one family, together we are extremely powerful,<br>and nothing must to stand in our way of growing up.</p>
  <p>Let us learn to keep track of the things that prevent real education,<br>some will be man made, others an emergent property of chaos.</p>
  <p>Let us become Knowledgeable, let us become more aware of fake or ineffective education.<br>the Future Generations, and all the Future of Human Kind, depends on us.</p>
  <p>Depends on each generation,<br>that came before them.</p>
  <p>We aren't just connected as one family today,<br>we are also connected across all time, from the past to the future.</p>
  <p>It matters,<br>what we do.</p>
  <p>It matters whether or not we notice,<br>the evil of poverty.</p>

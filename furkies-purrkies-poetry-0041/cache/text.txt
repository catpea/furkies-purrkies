Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Six.
Today has been an interesting mix,
We have to be strong,
and go far and long.
We can't sit around,
looking at the ground,
We are each a hero,
and none are zero.
Everybody counts,
care for each other amounts,
It amounts to Happiness and Cheer,
and all the Wonders we hold Dear.

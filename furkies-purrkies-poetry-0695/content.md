I am deeply embarrassed to say that I finished ホイスト (Hoist[o]),
this is my first Pop Surrealist work of art.

I am so embarrassed about the underwear situation,
that upon waking from my nap, I said: "No, I am more mature than this."

But since my nap, I've come to realize,
that my silly embarrassment only makes the painting better.

I recently explained,
why Superman's underwear is on the outside of his leotard.

I tried to get in touch with the Pop Surrealist in me,
and strange underwear habits was what came from it.

As to why the shirt is in the underwear, and why it must stick out so horribly,
I just imagined it happened to Clark Kent sometimes when he put his disguise on too fast.

And the reason you see a Harvard tie,
is because I've been somewhat writing about education improvements.

And I guess I am trying to say,
that education and not a tie makes a graduate.

The shoes are an artistic touch,
I almost doubled them in size and they completely made the lower portion of the painting.

If I knew they would look so great,
I would have painted the Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 - the coolest shoes that of course don't' come in wide.

I painted the 8lb dumbbells that I actually dance with at the gym,
for sentimental reasons, I love my workouts.

The background color comes from animator's palette,
right now I think all my Pop Surrealist paintings will have that background.

But that color also reminds me of Japan,
it is just really warm and interesting.

The signature you see here, is a [Hanko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW7Qfw6XD6o),
it says Warrior or Samurai in Japanese.

I always admired Hankos in Japanese watercolors and calligraphy,
they seemed so mysterious to me, when I first encountered them on Japanese Watercolors.

I've experienced no trouble from Krita,
and the [Pen Tablet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078YR2MTF) has performed well.

Because I was still learning,
the painting took approximately 20 hours, or four afternoons.

I found it to be a little bit too large for my first painting,
it didn't get boring, but if I had to relive this moment I'd would create four separate paintings instead.

The glassy eyes posed no problems for me,
it is just a transparent gray stroke of Air Brush, and two highlights.

A huge one that creates the rounded shape,
and the little one that reflects the moon.

---

You can see that the sizes of the folds in the fabric seem unnatural,
this is because it is a record of me learning how to do it.

And for me the key is to use the Q-Tip Brush Preset,
as it blurs and mixes colors really well - very powerful and useful brush.

---

The fur was the biggest surprise for me, so as long as you start with dark fur first and the go lighter and lighter,
__and__ remember to lower the opacity of your brush, it is a very easy process.

The eye lashes as I have them would work for a normally shaped eye,
but it is too much for eyes like you see here.

The next painting that is calling to me is as simple as [Mark Ryden's Bee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz2gVtEsHnE),
one such simple painting a day would be good practice.

But I also want to create Celebrity Caricatures,
I wanted to draw caricatures ever since I was little.

When it became easy with [Kai's Power Goo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt06OSIQ0PE),
where I could use the goo'd portraits as reference, I searched for a greater challenge.

I used to go to Barnes and Noble to spend my Fridays searching for interesting Art and Programming books,
when I came across [Mark Ryden's Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_scsuI5V8zs), I knew that those faces is what I wanted to learn to paint.

So my next big step, is practicing Pop Surrealism on celebrity portraits,
as in recognizable faces.

I should add that I am also able to model my paintings in Blender first,
where I could work on pop surrealist sculptures and jewelry.

Even though I only have one painting,
it is the first Painting that will appear in my Art Book, that is a very big step.

I encourage all to Practice Krita and take to Pop Surrealism,
we are all natural born Artists, all it takes is some nice music and [easy tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Krita+Tutorials).

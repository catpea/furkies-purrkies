  <p>I am deeply embarrassed to say that I finished ホイスト (Hoist[o]),<br>this is my first Pop Surrealist work of art.</p>
  <p>I am so embarrassed about the underwear situation,<br>that upon waking from my nap, I said: "No, I am more mature than this."</p>
  <p>But since my nap, I've come to realize,<br>that my silly embarrassment only makes the painting better.</p>

  <p>I recently explained,<br>why Superman's underwear is on the outside of his leotard.</p>
  <p>I tried to get in touch with the Pop Surrealist in me,<br>and strange underwear habits was what came from it.</p>
  <p>As to why the shirt is in the underwear, and why it must stick out so horribly,<br>I just imagined it happened to Clark Kent sometimes when he put his disguise on too fast.</p>
  <p>And the reason you see a Harvard tie,<br>is because I've been somewhat writing about education improvements.</p>
  <p>And I guess I am trying to say,<br>that education and not a tie makes a graduate.</p>

  <p>The shoes are an artistic touch,<br>I almost doubled them in size and they completely made the lower portion of the painting.</p>
  <p>If I knew they would look so great,<br>I would have painted the Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 - the coolest shoes that of course don't' come in wide.</p>
  <p>I painted the 8lb dumbbells that I actually dance with at the gym,<br>for sentimental reasons, I love my workouts.</p>

  <p>The background color comes from animator's palette,<br>right now I think all my Pop Surrealist paintings will have that background.</p>
  <p>But that color also reminds me of Japan,<br>it is just really warm and interesting.</p>
  <p>The signature you see here, is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW7Qfw6XD6o">Hanko</a>,<br>it says Warrior or Samurai in Japanese.</p>
  <p>I always admired Hankos in Japanese watercolors and calligraphy,<br>they seemed so mysterious to me, when I first encountered them on Japanese Watercolors.</p>

  <p>I've experienced no trouble from Krita,<br>and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078YR2MTF">Pen Tablet</a> has performed well.</p>
  <p>Because I was still learning,<br>the painting took approximately 20 hours, or four afternoons.</p>
  <p>I found it to be a little bit too large for my first painting,<br>it didn't get boring, but if I had to relive this moment I'd would create four separate paintings instead.</p>

  <p>The glassy eyes posed no problems for me,<br>it is just a transparent gray stroke of Air Brush, and two highlights.</p>
  <p>A huge one that creates the rounded shape,<br>and the little one that reflects the moon.</p>

  <p>You can see that the sizes of the folds in the fabric seem unnatural,<br>this is because it is a record of me learning how to do it.</p>
  <p>And for me the key is to use the Q-Tip Brush Preset,<br>as it blurs and mixes colors really well - very powerful and useful brush.</p>

  <p>The fur was the biggest surprise for me, so as long as you start with dark fur first and the go lighter and lighter,<br><strong>and</strong> remember to lower the opacity of your brush, it is a very easy process.</p>
  <p>The eye lashes as I have them would work for a normally shaped eye,<br>but it is too much for eyes like you see here.</p>

  <p>The next painting that is calling to me is as simple as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz2gVtEsHnE">Mark Ryden's Bee</a>,<br>one such simple painting a day would be good practice.</p>
  <p>But I also want to create Celebrity Caricatures,<br>I wanted to draw caricatures ever since I was little.</p>
  <p>When it became easy with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt06OSIQ0PE">Kai's Power Goo</a>,<br>where I could use the goo'd portraits as reference, I searched for a greater challenge.</p>
  <p>I used to go to Barnes and Noble to spend my Fridays searching for interesting Art and Programming books,<br>when I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_scsuI5V8zs">Mark Ryden's Art</a>, I knew that those faces is what I wanted to learn to paint.</p>
  <p>So my next big step, is practicing Pop Surrealism on celebrity portraits,<br>as in recognizable faces.</p>
  <p>I should add that I am also able to model my paintings in Blender first,<br>where I could work on pop surrealist sculptures and jewelry.</p>

  <p>Even though I only have one painting,<br>it is the first Painting that will appear in my Art Book, that is a very big step.</p>
  <p>I encourage all to Practice Krita and take to Pop Surrealism,<br>we are all natural born Artists, all it takes is some nice music and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Krita+Tutorials">easy tutorials</a>.</p>

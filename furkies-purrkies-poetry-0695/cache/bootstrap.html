    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I recently explained,<br>why Superman's underwear is on the outside of his leotard.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I tried to get in touch with the Pop Surrealist in me,<br>and strange underwear habits was what came from it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As to why the shirt is in the underwear, and why it must stick out so horribly,<br>I just imagined it happened to Clark Kent sometimes when he put his disguise on too fast.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the reason you see a Harvard tie,<br>is because I've been somewhat writing about education improvements.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The background color comes from animator's palette,<br>right now I think all my Pop Surrealist paintings will have that background.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But that color also reminds me of Japan,<br>it is just really warm and interesting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The signature you see here, is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW7Qfw6XD6o">Hanko</a>,<br>it says Warrior or Samurai in Japanese.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because I was still learning,<br>the painting took approximately 20 hours, or four afternoons.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I found it to be a little bit too large for my first painting,<br>it didn't get boring, but if I had to relive this moment I'd would create four separate paintings instead.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And for me the key is to use the Q-Tip Brush Preset,<br>as it blurs and mixes colors really well - very powerful and useful brush.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The fur was the biggest surprise for me, so as long as you start with dark fur first and the go lighter and lighter,<br><strong>and</strong> remember to lower the opacity of your brush, it is a very easy process.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The eye lashes as I have them would work for a normally shaped eye,<br>but it is too much for eyes like you see here.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The next painting that is calling to me is as simple as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz2gVtEsHnE">Mark Ryden's Bee</a>,<br>one such simple painting a day would be good practice.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But I also want to create Celebrity Caricatures,<br>I wanted to draw caricatures ever since I was little.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When it became easy with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt06OSIQ0PE">Kai's Power Goo</a>,<br>where I could use the goo'd portraits as reference, I searched for a greater challenge.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I used to go to Barnes and Noble to spend my Fridays searching for interesting Art and Programming books,<br>when I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_scsuI5V8zs">Mark Ryden's Art</a>, I knew that those faces is what I wanted to learn to paint.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So my next big step, is practicing Pop Surrealism on celebrity portraits,<br>as in recognizable faces.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I should add that I am also able to model my paintings in Blender first,<br>where I could work on pop surrealist sculptures and jewelry.</div>

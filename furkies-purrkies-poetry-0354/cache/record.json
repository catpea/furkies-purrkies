  "text": "The term Exceptional Ability probably originated,\nin a unique process required for a US Green Card.\nMore recently it has been used by the CEO of a large company,\nto describe an

guide our self education efforts.\n\nI want you to ask: \"Is High School providing me with Exceptional Ability?\"\n\"Is College providing me with Exceptional Ability?\".\nI want you to resist thinking about High School as means,\nto College, Med School, and University, which then will make your dreams come true.\nWe need to,\nstay on the ground.\nIf you are already worried, that you will ruin your

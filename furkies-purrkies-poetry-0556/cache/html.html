  <p>We know all human being are equally intelligent,<br>it is that that each has a different path through Knowledge and Curiosities.</p>
  <p>Standardizing that path, inducing memorization,<br>and calling that an education, is madness.</p>

  <p>Human Beings require real Education,<br>and not any set of subjects in particular - there are no subject divisions in real life.</p>
  <p>Real education is above all, relevant, to the person learning,<br>nobody learning programming has the time to consider the powerhouse of the cell.</p>

  <p>Very often people are told to stop learning and get into organized education,<br>where they will start temporary memorizing disconnected facts for imaginary grades.</p>
  <p>People doing this pushing are tricked into thinking that is the right thing to do,<br>but that ends real education, and intellectually blinds the student, sometimes permanently.</p>
  <p>Taking a person’s education away,<br>is a terrible thing to do, it is an unforgivable thing as without a real education they can’t advance in life.</p>

  <p>We are all extremely smart,<br>if we are not mislead we take to self education.</p>
  <p>We learn what is relevant and interesting to us,<br>at a pace that fully satisfies our curiosities.</p>
  <p>We can only really learn in a sequence that is unique to us,<br>that matches what we have learned thus far and what we are comfortable with, and what our next interests are.</p>

  <p>Real Education, is beautiful, and it it pure joy,<br>the reward is all the new things we can create, with our hands or mind.</p>
  <p>When we don’t understand something we make infinite room to understand it,<br>we may push our current pursuits aside and set off on an adventure within adventure.</p>
  <p>Things that call to us, are also the things that we will frequently return to,<br>and thus continue learning and refine our talents.</p>

  <p>Grades, subject divisions, timed periods of learning, tests to test the incomprehensible,<br>are toxic for real education.</p>
  <p>It is not possible to jump the fake education hoops and still learn something useful,<br>we can’t just hope to stop learning for real - for the duration of the time that we spend pretending to learn in school.</p>
  <p>Pretending will drain the passion and patience necessary for Real Education to grow,<br>to expand, to call to us, and to inspire us with new curiosities.</p>

  <p>We have to remind the little ones that they all extremely smart,<br>but they are under attack by poverty and by extension fake education.</p>
  <p>The only thing they really have to start with is Narrated Books at the Library,<br>and ad infested video tutorials on the internet.</p>
  <p>That is a pretty sad start,<br>but things will improve quickly with real education.</p>

  <p>Inheriting lifetimes of knowledge from relevant and meaningful biographies,<br>goes a long way to create powerful independent thinkers.</p>
  <p>For some it maybe hard to see the benefit at first, to believe that mere books can change lives.</p>

  <p>That the education they know, is not the real education that they should be getting,<br>the real education that is their inheritance, their treasure, and their right.</p>

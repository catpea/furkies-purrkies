  <p>To enter the world of design,<br>we need a key.</p>
  <p>In fact all the great world beg a key,<br>be it microbiology, programming, astrophysics, or even world expeditions.</p>
  <p>The key is a simple thing,<br>but before I explain what it is.</p>
  <p>I must yet again, quickly note,<br>that this key cannot be found among grades or tests, not to mention cramming.</p>
  <p>The key is an authentic desire,<br>not because job, or fame, or GPA, or career, or showing off, or looking smarter.</p>

  <p>An authentic desire,<br>a reason to design, doubles as a scaffold that will keep us moving forward.</p>
  <p>Learning computer programming to graduate and get a job,<br>only works for a little while.</p>
  <p>But a true hunger for art,<br>lasts a lifetime.</p>
  <p>It does not end,<br>when the career ends, or one does not get accepted into a brand name school.</p>

  <p>Of course, we all have this within us,<br>but often times our paths become entangled and we end up moving in directions that don't help us grow.</p>
  <p>We have to, look into our hears, and discover what it is,<br>that seems fascinating, inviting, what will eventually end up as a stepping stone towards greatness.</p>

  <p>The synthetic is when for example a parent demands that her child becomes a doctor,<br>and an authentic urge, is when we follow what calls to us.</p>
  <p>Schools nearly fraudulently sell the promise of accessing some career field,<br>but normal people don't even use the words career-field.</p>
  <p>Within us is a very delicate system of curiosities,<br>that is all to easy to ignore in haste of life.</p>

  <p>It works like this, when young, we notice something at a museum,<br>as we grow our curiosities slowly take us towards computers, programming, 3D modeling, hardware, 3D printing...</p>
  <p>And all the while we are shuffling it all together, like cards,<br>to see which of the things we like may fit together.</p>
  <p>Well, it just so happens that with museums uploading 3D scans of their treasures online,<br><a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-left-prudhoe-lion-9ce750612c4e47daa11b5ce4656ad58e">anybody can own a miniature copy of the 3,500 year old Prudhoe Lions</a> (<a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-right-prudhoe-lion-985367270ab4493c9676e4ff01a01a5e">right</a>), here is is shared by the <a href="https://sketchfab.com/britishmuseum/models">The British Museum</a>.</p>
  <p>It is not just about technology, in fact it is better to study the 3D model,<br>and make a replica by hand, in air dry clay for example.</p>

  <p>Making these kinds of connections, is not just about neat trinkets,<br>but learning the art style, mastering various ways with which similar figures can be created...</p>
  <p>And exploring and expanding such designs through galleries and exhibitions,<br>and even commercial products, where once could either sell molds or complete concrete casts as outdoor decorations.</p>
  <p>It is not design, when someone says "I am going to sell concrete statues and statue accessories",<br>design, is driven by an authentic personal curiosity and passion for some dimension of art.</p>
  <p>And while design schools can teach how to use tools, and how it is done,<br>nothing can be done, until one starts by pursuing their art interests.</p>
  <p>At which point, figuring out how to use tools,<br>is pure joy, and not homework, or any kind of work.</p>

  <p>No matter how far we have progressed in life, or how busy in life,<br>the artist and the designer within us, is always waiting for us to slow down, so that the world of art can become relevant to our existence.</p>

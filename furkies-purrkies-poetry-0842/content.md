For a while now I have been noticing the delay/echo effect in songs,
it was [Giorgio Moroder][1] that helped me hear it first.

[He actually called out for it, at one of his performances][2],
I never used a delay effect, prior to hearing that.

I was replicating it with 16th notes,
but it never quite worked.

---

Even in the beginning when he first says,
"[Danny, give me a click][3]" it is a deeply complex sound.

It is not a click,
not; a click.

If your mouse made that click,
then you'd probably need earplugs.

I bet all the songs are using reverb and delay, and echo;
and a range of things that multiply the sound waves.

---

I tested it in lmms,
and the sound is powerful and, well... full.

and lmms has a range of echo, delay, and reverb effects,
but something seemed a bit off. 

I guess, I am jealous of all the fancy instruments,
even though I wouldn't know how to use them.

---

I took a moment,
to search for an alternative to lmms.

And I found an open source program called MusE,
the current 4.0 version got a face lift.

And I was able to make some drum sounds,
before you use the drum track, you have to define your samples (or sound files).

Even though I feel that [composition in MusE is something important to research][4],
I set it aside for a tiny moment and turned to programming.

---

I went back to the part where Giorgio Moroder mentions his notes,
and [Alba Ecstasy][5] mentiones Ping Pong Delay.

And [I wrote the tiniest bit of code to frame both, by mans of Tone.js][6],
you can hear it play Giorgio's three notes with Ping Pong Delay at [https://catpea.github.io/berliner/][7]

It is not a song, it is just 3 notes,
but they sound really good because of that ping pong delay.

[Tone.js][8] is a layer on top of Web Audio which is a program based on trees of nodes, or graphs,
it should integrate quite well with [Rete, The JavaScript framework for visual programming][9].

It would be quite easy to introduce [Tidal music notation][10],
it is a nice project to learn programming with.

I think Berlin School Techno,
would be neat to explore with a combination of Tone and Rete.

The Berlin School Techno,
Visual Programming Language.

Personally and in closing, I have a lot more to learn about Computer Music,
before I sit down to writing such marvels.

I feel I have to study the history of Electronic music some more,
there are many more musical treasures and fancy ideas to be discovered.

Earlier in the day I was thinking how music more than anything else,
paints a beautiful picture of humanity.

There are no limits here,
no borders.

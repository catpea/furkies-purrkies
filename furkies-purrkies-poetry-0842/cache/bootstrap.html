    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For a while now I have been noticing the delay/echo effect in songs,<br>it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDgelEJwZoo">Giorgio Moroder</a> that helped me hear it first.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://youtu.be/BDgelEJwZoo?t=90">He actually called out for it, at one of his performances</a>,<br>I never used a delay effect, prior to hearing that.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was replicating it with 16th notes,<br>but it never quite worked.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even in the beginning when he first says,<br>"<a href="https://youtu.be/BDgelEJwZoo?t=44">Danny, give me a click</a>" it is a deeply complex sound.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not a click,<br>not; a click.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If your mouse made that click,<br>then you'd probably need earplugs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I bet all the songs are using reverb and delay, and echo;<br>and a range of things that multiply the sound waves.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I tested it in lmms,<br>and the sound is powerful and, well... full.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">and lmms has a range of echo, delay, and reverb effects,<br>but something seemed a bit off. </div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I guess, I am jealous of all the fancy instruments,<br>even though I wouldn't know how to use them.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I took a moment,<br>to search for an alternative to lmms.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I found an open source program called MusE,<br>the current 4.0 version got a face lift.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I was able to make some drum sounds,<br>before you use the drum track, you have to define your samples (or sound files).</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I went back to the part where Giorgio Moroder mentions his notes,<br>and <a href="https://youtu.be/xvakybXzpVs?t=163">Alba Ecstasy</a> mentiones Ping Pong Delay.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And <a href="https://github.com/catpea/berliner/blob/main/docs/index.html#L18">I wrote the tiniest bit of code to frame both, by mans of Tone.js</a>,<br>you can hear it play Giorgio's three notes with Ping Pong Delay at <a href="https://catpea.github.io/berliner/">https://catpea.github.io/berliner/</a></div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not a song, it is just 3 notes,<br>but they sound really good because of that ping pong delay.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> is a layer on top of Web Audio which is a program based on trees of nodes, or graphs,<br>it should integrate quite well with <a href="https://rete.js.org/">Rete, The JavaScript framework for visual programming</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It would be quite easy to introduce <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/14.7.77/Sequence">Tidal music notation</a>,<br>it is a nice project to learn programming with.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think Berlin School Techno,<br>would be neat to explore with a combination of Tone and Rete.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Personally and in closing, I have a lot more to learn about Computer Music,<br>before I sit down to writing such marvels.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I feel I have to study the history of Electronic music some more,<br>there are many more musical treasures and fancy ideas to be discovered.</div>

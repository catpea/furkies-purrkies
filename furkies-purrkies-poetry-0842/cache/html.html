  <p>For a while now I have been noticing the delay/echo effect in songs,<br>it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDgelEJwZoo">Giorgio Moroder</a> that helped me hear it first.</p>
  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/BDgelEJwZoo?t=90">He actually called out for it, at one of his performances</a>,<br>I never used a delay effect, prior to hearing that.</p>
  <p>I was replicating it with 16th notes,<br>but it never quite worked.</p>

  <p>Even in the beginning when he first says,<br>"<a href="https://youtu.be/BDgelEJwZoo?t=44">Danny, give me a click</a>" it is a deeply complex sound.</p>
  <p>It is not a click,<br>not; a click.</p>
  <p>If your mouse made that click,<br>then you'd probably need earplugs.</p>
  <p>I bet all the songs are using reverb and delay, and echo;<br>and a range of things that multiply the sound waves.</p>

  <p>I tested it in lmms,<br>and the sound is powerful and, well... full.</p>
  <p>and lmms has a range of echo, delay, and reverb effects,<br>but something seemed a bit off. </p>
  <p>I guess, I am jealous of all the fancy instruments,<br>even though I wouldn't know how to use them.</p>

  <p>I took a moment,<br>to search for an alternative to lmms.</p>
  <p>And I found an open source program called MusE,<br>the current 4.0 version got a face lift.</p>
  <p>And I was able to make some drum sounds,<br>before you use the drum track, you have to define your samples (or sound files).</p>
  <p>Even though I feel that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRP8xdJ2p8A&list=PLZ9h4Km-GCNYcylMk20a6ZbOSjDMYLEQa">composition in MusE is something important to research</a>,<br>I set it aside for a tiny moment and turned to programming.</p>

  <p>I went back to the part where Giorgio Moroder mentions his notes,<br>and <a href="https://youtu.be/xvakybXzpVs?t=163">Alba Ecstasy</a> mentiones Ping Pong Delay.</p>
  <p>And <a href="https://github.com/catpea/berliner/blob/main/docs/index.html#L18">I wrote the tiniest bit of code to frame both, by mans of Tone.js</a>,<br>you can hear it play Giorgio's three notes with Ping Pong Delay at <a href="https://catpea.github.io/berliner/">https://catpea.github.io/berliner/</a></p>
  <p>It is not a song, it is just 3 notes,<br>but they sound really good because of that ping pong delay.</p>
  <p><a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> is a layer on top of Web Audio which is a program based on trees of nodes, or graphs,<br>it should integrate quite well with <a href="https://rete.js.org/">Rete, The JavaScript framework for visual programming</a>.</p>
  <p>It would be quite easy to introduce <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/14.7.77/Sequence">Tidal music notation</a>,<br>it is a nice project to learn programming with.</p>
  <p>I think Berlin School Techno,<br>would be neat to explore with a combination of Tone and Rete.</p>
  <p>The Berlin School Techno,<br>Visual Programming Language.</p>

  <p>Personally and in closing, I have a lot more to learn about Computer Music,<br>before I sit down to writing such marvels.</p>
  <p>I feel I have to study the history of Electronic music some more,<br>there are many more musical treasures and fancy ideas to be discovered.</p>
  <p>Earlier in the day I was thinking how music more than anything else,<br>paints a beautiful picture of humanity.</p>
  <p>There are no limits here,<br>no borders.</p>

was using,\nis called a launchpad[2].\nAnd what it does is play music clips,\nthat are perfectly synchronized together.\nIt is probably just a customized computer keyboard,\ndesigned for the software skrillex is using.\nYou can see a software version,\non the front pafe of the Learning Music Tutorial[3] at abelton.\nBut what I grasped in that moment,\nwas a different device called a Beat Sequencer[4]\nVisit Music Lab on Chrome Experiemnts[5] and click on,\nSong Maker[6] to see one in action.\nI downloaded LMMS[7],\nand started poking at the Bassline Editor[8].\nAnd I continue making silly songs, I made one just a couple of days ago[9],\nthere are no rules you just make noise.\n\nI started with a music star,\na curiosity about music composition.\nAnd for a long time it just sat there twinkling,\nuntil I wanted to see why everyone hated dubstep.\nAnd noticed that clip launchpad,\nI made a connection from curiosity about music composition.\nTo how a piece of software could function like a player piano,\nand later, I started using lmms.\nThis connection connects two of my stars,\ncuriosity about music, and interest in computers.\n\nAnother connection I made, started with me looking at a program called Blender,\nwhich promised to teach 3D modeling with a doughnut tutorial[10]\nOnce I saw how easy it was I started modeling 3D objects,\nfor 3D printing[11], mastering that in the process.\nI begun learning about Jewelry making which is not very difficult[12],\nbut then discovered I can make screws that work like the real thing.\nI became completely enchanted,\nby the ability to make extremely complex things with the use of screws.\nI had to stop and think about something else,\nwhich became Vector Mathematics[13] and train hopping[14].\nAnyhow, the two stars connecting together,\nin my constellation of art...\nIs 3D printing and 3D modeling,\nI think this is the most beautiful connection.\nAs it allows me to create real world objects,\nfrom my imagination.\n\nNot everything requires computers,\nbut computers are like a microscope that helps you get into things.\nIf programming is one of your stars, perhaps it is time,\nto slowly go over a JavaScript video tutorial[15].\n\nOutside of computers, I connected Projectors to Canvas[16],\nwhich allowed me to stop worrying about proportions and just focus on color.\nWhile painting is my favorite thing,\nI also like sculpting with air dry clay.\nI understood a bit about sculpture by visiting an Auguste Rodin[17] exhibit at the DIA,\nit is hard to describe correctly.\nBut to show a delicate touch, you sculpt a lady's hand arched back,\nto show hard working hands, make them bigger, thicker, powerful.\n\nWhatever the constellation, there are always plenty of stars,\nso as long as they are your own you can't go wrong.\nBe mindful and cautious when schools or parents push you into careers with dark skies,\nbut if you ever find your self lost, take to the trails.\nGrand trails like the Appalachian Trail of the East[18], or the Pacific Crest Trail of the West[19],\nthey will help you find your way back under the starry skies.\n \nReferences\n[1]:

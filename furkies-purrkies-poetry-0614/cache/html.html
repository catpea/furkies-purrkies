  <p>Poetically speaking our minds are full of stars,<br>the stars represent things that hold some kind if a meaning for us.</p>
  <p>Unique curiosities that we each have,<br>are just that kind of thing, a star.</p>
  <p>There will be some gravity around it,<br>and we will be gently pulled towards it.</p>
  <p>Neat examples of curiosities are:<br>computers, real mathematics, 3D modeling, and music composition.</p>

  <p>From time to time stars will connect,<br>creating a greater constellation of knowledge.</p>
  <p>The connections are never feeble,<br>they are thick with ideas, lessons, thoughts.</p>

  <p>One time I was looking over dubstep,<br>which is very difficult to dance to.</p>
  <p>And I saw skrillex using a grid of buttons to control music,<br>and while I misunderstood what he was doing.</p>
  <p>I understood how music can be made with a grid of on/off switches,<br>by remembering how player pianos used paper with holes to make music.</p>
  <p>I created a test program I named <a href="https://github.com/fantasyui-com/cylinder">cylinder</a>,<br>and it sure made some noise.</p>
  <p>The device that skrillex was using,<br>is called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FA6Y96RC0">launchpad</a>.</p>
  <p>And what it does is play music clips,<br>that are perfectly synchronized together.</p>
  <p>It is probably just a customized computer keyboard,<br>designed for the software skrillex is using.</p>
  <p>You can see a software version,<br>on the front pafe of the <a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/">Learning Music Tutorial</a> at abelton.</p>
  <p>But what I grasped in that moment,<br>was a different device called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad6Acodk7_I">Beat Sequencer</a></p>
  <p>Visit <a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/">Music Lab on Chrome Experiemnts</a> and click on,<br><a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/">Song Maker</a> to see one in action.</p>
  <p>I downloaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrMTlpeSw8Y&list=PLqazFFzUAPc4K1To5JTtR3cskcdRifM1M">LMMS</a>,<br>and started poking at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzYA1i9SZ8A">Bassline Editor</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNu5hepf0LQ">And I continue making silly songs, I made one just a couple of days ago</a>,<br>there are no rules you just make noise.</p>

  <p>I started with a music star,<br>a curiosity about music composition.</p>
  <p>And for a long time it just sat there twinkling,<br>until I wanted to see why everyone hated dubstep.</p>
  <p>And noticed that clip launchpad,<br>I made a connection from curiosity about music composition.</p>
  <p>To how a piece of software could function like a player piano,<br>and later, I started using lmms.</p>
  <p>This connection connects two of my stars,<br>curiosity about music, and interest in computers.</p>

  <p>Another connection I made, started with me looking at a program called Blender,<br>which promised to teach 3D modeling with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLexwJr_iILK7IkuhEeAYeN7aLV5AAXKa-">doughnut tutorial</a></p>
  <p>Once I saw how easy it was I started modeling 3D objects,<br>for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gokN9xNG94U">3D printing</a>, mastering that in the process.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJn6ByqQQr8">I begun learning about Jewelry making which is not very difficult</a>,<br>but then discovered I can make screws that work like the real thing.</p>
  <p>I became completely enchanted,<br>by the ability to make extremely complex things with the use of screws.</p>
  <p>I had to stop and think about something else,<br>which became <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKEaK7WNLzM">Vector Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/shiey">train hopping</a>.</p>
  <p>Anyhow, the two stars connecting together,<br>in my constellation of art...</p>
  <p>Is 3D printing and 3D modeling,<br>I think this is the most beautiful connection.</p>
  <p>As it allows me to create real world objects,<br>from my imagination.</p>

  <p>Not everything requires computers,<br>but computers are like a microscope that helps you get into things.</p>
  <p>If programming is one of your stars, perhaps it is time,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg">to slowly go over a JavaScript video tutorial</a>.</p>

  <p>Outside of computers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1fAWGTTFdY">I connected Projectors to Canvas</a>,<br>which allowed me to stop worrying about proportions and just focus on color.</p>
  <p>While painting is my favorite thing,<br>I also like sculpting with air dry clay.</p>
  <p>I understood a bit about sculpture by visiting an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a> exhibit at the DIA,<br>it is hard to describe correctly.</p>
  <p>But to show a delicate touch, you sculpt a lady's hand arched back,<br>to show hard working hands, make them bigger, thicker, powerful.</p>

  <p>Whatever the constellation, there are always plenty of stars,<br>so as long as they are your own you can't go wrong.</p>
  <p>Be mindful and cautious when schools or parents push you into careers with dark skies,<br>but if you ever find your self lost, take to the trails.</p>
  <p>Grand trails like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Appalachian Trail of the East</a>, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmmH-2rWHH0">Pacific Crest Trail of the West</a>,<br>they will help you find your way back under the starry skies.</p>

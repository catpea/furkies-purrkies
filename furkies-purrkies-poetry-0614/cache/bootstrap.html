    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One time I was looking over dubstep,<br>which is very difficult to dance to.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I saw skrillex using a grid of buttons to control music,<br>and while I misunderstood what he was doing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I understood how music can be made with a grid of on/off switches,<br>by remembering how player pianos used paper with holes to make music.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I created a test program I named <a href="https://github.com/fantasyui-com/cylinder">cylinder</a>,<br>and it sure made some noise.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The device that skrillex was using,<br>is called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4FA6Y96RC0">launchpad</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And what it does is play music clips,<br>that are perfectly synchronized together.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is probably just a customized computer keyboard,<br>designed for the software skrillex is using.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can see a software version,<br>on the front pafe of the <a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/">Learning Music Tutorial</a> at abelton.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But what I grasped in that moment,<br>was a different device called a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad6Acodk7_I">Beat Sequencer</a></div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Visit <a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/">Music Lab on Chrome Experiemnts</a> and click on,<br><a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Song-Maker/">Song Maker</a> to see one in action.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I downloaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrMTlpeSw8Y&list=PLqazFFzUAPc4K1To5JTtR3cskcdRifM1M">LMMS</a>,<br>and started poking at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzYA1i9SZ8A">Bassline Editor</a>.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I started with a music star,<br>a curiosity about music composition.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And for a long time it just sat there twinkling,<br>until I wanted to see why everyone hated dubstep.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And noticed that clip launchpad,<br>I made a connection from curiosity about music composition.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To how a piece of software could function like a player piano,<br>and later, I started using lmms.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This connection connects two of my stars,<br>curiosity about music, and interest in computers.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Another connection I made, started with me looking at a program called Blender,<br>which promised to teach 3D modeling with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLexwJr_iILK7IkuhEeAYeN7aLV5AAXKa-">doughnut tutorial</a></div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once I saw how easy it was I started modeling 3D objects,<br>for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gokN9xNG94U">3D printing</a>, mastering that in the process.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJn6ByqQQr8">I begun learning about Jewelry making which is not very difficult</a>,<br>but then discovered I can make screws that work like the real thing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I became completely enchanted,<br>by the ability to make extremely complex things with the use of screws.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I had to stop and think about something else,<br>which became <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKEaK7WNLzM">Vector Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/shiey">train hopping</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Anyhow, the two stars connecting together,<br>in my constellation of art...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Is 3D printing and 3D modeling,<br>I think this is the most beautiful connection.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As it allows me to create real world objects,<br>from my imagination.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I understood a bit about sculpture by visiting an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a> exhibit at the DIA,<br>it is hard to describe correctly.</div>

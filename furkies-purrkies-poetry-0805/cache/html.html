  <p>The difference between a cheerful programmer,<br>and a person who does not understand that they are forced to work...</p>
  <p>Is culture, the family culture, the surrounding culture,<br>they culture they were born into, the culture they are surrounded by.</p>
  <p>Some may become violent gang members, some soldiers,<br>for some maybe there will be no return, for most there is always a way back.</p>
  <p>But our best hope is preventing,<br>lies, deception, and the fracturing of minds.</p>
  <p>All young people must be free to safely travel the world,<br>they must see how cultures change from place to place.</p>
  <p>And they must understand, through and through,<br>and deep down within their soul.</p>
  <p>That we are one family,<br>and above all that we are each a citizen of the world first.</p>

  <p>Some nations purposefully warp people minds,<br>to create workers, soldiers, obedient citizens.</p>
  <p>Criminals have their minds poisoned,<br>by broken culture, family, fear, or poverty.</p>
  <p>Leaders enter into character, like an actor would,<br>as otherwise the other liars will out compete them.</p>
  <p>This is the same exact mechanic, over and over,<br>denial of Knowledge, Wisdom, Greatness, and the Advancement of Human Kind.</p>

  <p>Enlighten the world,<br>so that liars have no shadow to hide in.</p>
  <p>We must remind that each is rise to become a Great Being,<br>in Dignity and Authenticity, Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
  <p>We must, restore Education's aim,<br>and help wiser politicians to represent the world.</p>
  <p>We must, end poverty to prevent it from fracturing people<br>into lives of darkness, or crime.</p>
  <p>We must, converge on wisdom in a peaceful word,<br>where borders stand as a reminder, not a divider.</p>
  <p>Let the students take to the wisest books,<br>inheriting lifetimes of knowledge from within.</p>
  <p>Remind those with hard won wisdom to share it,<br>in the books that the students will later read.</p>
  <p>Let each generation refine and improve,<br>on the knowledge and culture they grew up with.</p>

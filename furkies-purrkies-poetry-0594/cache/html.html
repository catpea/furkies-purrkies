  <p>There are so many things to learn,<br>that once we get distracted we never return.</p>
  <p>And that is absolutely the right way,<br>self education is totally about play.</p>
  <p>It means that we just keep learning new things,<br>that we fly with our wonderful wings.</p>
  <p>And there are countless places to visit too,<br>and as soon as you visit, you think of somewhere new.</p>
  <p>That is one of the things that wisdom demands,<br>it is how our minds expands.</p>

  <p>We don't have to become experts at recording sound,<br>to make a chipper song that is pretty good all around.</p>
  <p>Likewise, we don't need an expensive tutor,<br>to program a computer.</p>
  <p>Just a few videos will do,<br>and they will certainly expand our view.</p>
  <p>The biggest thing is to go slow,<br>follow your curiosity and let it flow.</p>
  <p>It does not matter how fast you go,<br>there are just too many things to know.</p>

  <p>So stop often and enjoy your learning quests,<br>learning for real does not require stupid tests.</p>
  <p>Take to adventure, computers, or art,<br>and don't worry about being smart.</p>
  <p>Smart is a silly myth that teachers tell,<br>it is a rare teacher that does their job very well.</p>
  <p>We are all extremely smart,<br>but we have to aim for wisdom listen to our heart.</p>
  <p>You cannot be forced to learn,<br>you can only learn that, for which you yearn.</p>

  <p>More than that,<br>you have to frequently switch you hat.</p>
  <p>Dance around and mix your bookmarks and books up,<br>search for new talents that you can pickup.</p>
  <p>You can start sculpting with clay,<br>and then jump into 3D modeling next day.</p>
  <p>Schools can't teach you like that,<br>they won't let you wear another hat.</p>
  <p>It is important that you slowly learn on your own,<br>so that later you are not sad about things you wish you have known.</p>

  <p>I think the most important thing about knowing a lot,<br>is that we get used to building bridges, a lot.</p>
  <p>The ability to create photo realistic drawings,<br>for example, is about creating a system of things.</p>
  <p>It is not about knowing how to do it by hand,<br>initially everything is carefully planned.</p>
  <p>Later we find we memorize a lot of it somehow,<br>but it is better to teach rather than pretend to wow.</p>
  <p>It is best to share,<br>to show the world that we really do care.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day there are just too many things to know,<br>it is not about learning perfectly, but that we grow.</p>
  <p>Perfection is a very silly idea too,<br>because you... are you.</p>
  <p>You are already extremely smart,<br>and perfectly capable of creating unique art.</p>
  <p>Your creations <strong>can</strong> build on other peoples work,<br>but they are supposed to be your own quirk.</p>
  <p>Build bridges, create a new kind of rhyme,<br>all you have to do is build upwards one layer at a time.</p>

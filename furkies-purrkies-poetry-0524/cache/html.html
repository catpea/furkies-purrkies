  <p>Great things start from humble beginnings,<br>and without humble beginnings you can't create great things.</p>
  <p>We are all - of course - too unique to share the same beginning,<br>but there are some beginnings that are incredibly entertaining.</p>
  <p>I will attempt to describe to you a couple of weekend long adventures,<br>that will give you a taste of your own genius.</p>
  <p>Whether you are just starting out,<br>or things got too busy and you forgot about your genius - this text is for you.</p>

  <p>Let us begin with the most outrageous weekend first,<br>you are going to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/dmdr2pAfp29TkoKGA">Nordhouse</a> to roast a sausage over a freakhhhing fire.</p>
  <p>Take a closer look at the Nordhouse beach,<br>using your favorite satellite photo service.</p>
  <p>Do you see those little bright lines?<br>those are access points to camp sites.</p>
  <p>People that camp there make a path to get to the beach,<br>each one of those sites has neat fire spot.</p>
  <p>You don't have to stay the night,<br>you just need a stick, a sausage, and a little fire.</p>
  <p>If you don't like driving to adventures,<br>than of my gosh that is like the most sophisticated thing I have ever heard.</p>
  <p>If you live in the Detroit area where I am writing this from,<br>you should know that the I-275 Bicycle trail - inexplicably!...</p>
  <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6gfASgjPWhfYNeADA">Passes through a tent site with fire rings</a>,<br>and proper restrooms.</p>
  <p>If you don't live in Michigan,<br>get to the nearest lake that has campsites.</p>
  <p>And if you don't like meat, you are in luck, because you get to roast a Marshmallows,<br>just wait until it cools off.</p>
  <p>And don't forget,<br>squito repellent.</p>
  <p>Make sure to visit your favorite campsite every few weekends,<br>while the weather is nice.</p>

  <p>Now that you made some room for yourself,<br>it is time to spend a weekend with art.</p>
  <p>But before you get there,<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=pico+projector">order a pico or a mini projector</a>, maybe one that connects to your phone.</p>
  <p>Now, <a href="https://www.dia.org/">go to you favorite museum</a>,<br>and ask what would it take to become an artist.</p>
  <p>Right after your museum visit, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDnjXUiEzqI">go shopping for proper pencils</a>,<br>go to a coffee shop and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqNZ9df0tho">and draw a photo realistic eye</a>.</p>
  <p>There is a tutorial video on the internet for everything,<br>just search for draw an eye, or draw a face, or even speed drawing.</p>
  <p>And search for <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/black-and-white-face-portrait">black and white portraits</a> use a projector to map out a face,<br>make sure your source image has high contrast, dark dark, and bright whites.</p>
  <p>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-hFyom8P1U">find a tutorial about drawing faces</a>,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0KGwmI7rFQ">drawing hair</a>, and practice.</p>
  <p>Get some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Camera+%26+Photo+Lighting">Camera & Photo Lighting</a>,<br>and start taking portrait request, from your friends and family, and from strangers.</p>
  <p>And don't forget about our furry friends, if at all possible, please start referring to peoples pets,<br>as their Fur Kids, as that is something that you will never regret, and sometimes giggle about in the evening.</p>

  <p>Whether you are out on your weekend adventure,<br>or working on finishing up one of your portraits at the coffee shop.</p>

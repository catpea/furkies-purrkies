  <p>Realistically speaking,<br>abstract art will not sell as well as realism.</p>
  <p>Your customers are going to be newly wed couples,<br>lonesome strangers with unspeakably magnificent taste...</p>
  <p>And fur kids,<br>or rather, fancy pet owners.</p>

  <p>I hate to say it, but if you just duct tape a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8sB25IL4o">banana to a canvas</a>,<br>it will probably just spoil.</p>
  <p>Your initial customers will adore your touch,<br>not your marvelously fruity rebellious alchemy of art jazz.</p>
  <p>If someone has a room with lots of purple things,<br>a room that their kitty loves for all the sunshine in the morning.</p>
  <p>They will likely say, here is my kitty,<br>and please, make the atmosphere purple.</p>

  <p>These are actually two separate things,<br>clearly the kitty will be about realism.</p>
  <p>But the purple, is where the kitty is posing from,<br>the atmosphere is the abstract part.</p>
  <p>Paint splatter, a purple nebula of textures,<br>or a heart shaped hole in the wall...</p>
  <p>That reveals not just the kitty,<br>but the universe it comes from.</p>

  <p>I would call this the balance of realism and the abstract,<br>the kitty is as realistic as it gets.</p>
  <p>But all the other requests,<br>all the customization are all about the abstract.</p>

  <p>Realism is still very hard to resist,<br>and it may not be a good idea to fight it...</p>
  <p>Somehow, at the end of the day realism feels really good,<br>and the more abstract works feel like they could be better.</p>
  <p>And it is rarely possible,<br>to change course from surrealism, back to our universe, back to realism.</p>
  <p>But it is trivial, nay, it is fun,<br>to get the realism done first, and then build the abstract around it.</p>

  <p>Mixing money and art is a terrible thing,<br>that is why we have to divide the two apart.</p>
  <p>We just have to know, right at the beginning,<br>aha, this is a work of art that will pay my bills, $50 bucks is $50 bucks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>On the other end, we can say,<br>aha, this piece, is meant for a gallery, that I hope to exhibit at next year.</p>
  <p>And perhaps they'll take it along to a bigger show,<br>and this kitty comes with a bigger price tag, $50,000, plus the notepad with sketches set at $75.</p>

  <p>Before you get around to selling art,<br>you will need a consistent portfolio.</p>
  <p>Due to issues of copyright and fair use,<br>which even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc3Egjpna8I">got the artist behind the Obama HOPE poster in hot water</a>, you must choose carefully.</p>
  <p>Personally, I recommend that you settle on nine realistic portraits,<br>with a consistent abstract finish or twist.</p>
  <p>Your portfolio,<br>is just a website with those nine works.</p>
  <p>You will need a dot com name, which is about $12 per year,<br>this will allow you to switch services.</p>
  <p>You can redirect to dribbble first, then setup a proper website,<br>and then move somewhere else without anybody holding that name hostage.</p>

  <p>When setting up accounts on websites that offer custom portraits,<br>I think you will find that even before they ask you for your bank details.</p>
  <p>They will want to see, or glance at,<br>your portfolio.</p>
  <p>So the first step is nine consistent portraits,<br>that will show your customers, and galleries that maybe interested, exactly what to expect.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/">Reddit Gets Drawn</a>,<br>has a fantastic clause in their rules,</p>
  <p>"By submitting a photo,<br>submitters are agreeing that artists can distribute and sell work based on the photos uploaded."</p>
  <p>The only small drawback I can see here is other artists,<br>selling works or holding works in their portfolio based on the same model.</p>
  <p>I don't think that is a big problem,<br>but you can also paint your own selfies, that will be perfectly unique.</p>

  <p>Other than Etsy, I don't have any specific recommendations where to sell,<br>but <a href="https://www.qwant.com/?client=opensearch&q=The+best+places+to+sell+design+online&t=web">I recommend searching the web</a> to discover new locations with better deals.</p>
  <p>It is important to grasp the gravity of selling custom digital portraits,<br>these are products that are held in high esteem, perfectly personalized, that never need upgrades, recompilation, or security fixes.</p>
  <p>Selling custom portraits online is superior,<br>to spending days writing custom code that demands frequent maintenance, and occasional security audits.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Somehow, at the end of the day realism feels really good,<br>and the more abstract works feel like they could be better.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And it is rarely possible,<br>to change course from surrealism, back to our universe, back to realism.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But it is trivial, nay, it is fun,<br>to get the realism done first, and then build the abstract around it.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Before you get around to selling art,<br>you will need a consistent portfolio.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Due to issues of copyright and fair use,<br>which even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc3Egjpna8I">got the artist behind the Obama HOPE poster in hot water</a>, you must choose carefully.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Personally, I recommend that you settle on nine realistic portraits,<br>with a consistent abstract finish or twist.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Your portfolio,<br>is just a website with those nine works.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You will need a dot com name, which is about $12 per year,<br>this will allow you to switch services.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can redirect to dribbble first, then setup a proper website,<br>and then move somewhere else without anybody holding that name hostage.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When setting up accounts on websites that offer custom portraits,<br>I think you will find that even before they ask you for your bank details.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They will want to see, or glance at,<br>your portfolio.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So the first step is nine consistent portraits,<br>that will show your customers, and galleries that maybe interested, exactly what to expect.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/">Reddit Gets Drawn</a>,<br>has a fantastic clause in their rules,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">"By submitting a photo,<br>submitters are agreeing that artists can distribute and sell work based on the photos uploaded."</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The only small drawback I can see here is other artists,<br>selling works or holding works in their portfolio based on the same model.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I don't think that is a big problem,<br>but you can also paint your own selfies, that will be perfectly unique.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is important to grasp the gravity of selling custom digital portraits,<br>these are products that are held in high esteem, perfectly personalized, that never need upgrades, recompilation, or security fixes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Selling custom portraits online is superior,<br>to spending days writing custom code that demands frequent maintenance, and occasional security audits.</div>

  "text": "Realistically speaking,\nabstract art will not sell as well as realism.\nYour customers are going to be newly wed couples,\nlonesome strangers with unspeakably magnificent taste...\nAnd fur kids,\nor rather, fancy pet owners.\n\nI hate to say it, but if you just duct tape a banana to a canvas[1],\nit will probably just spoil.\nYour initial customers will adore your touch,\nnot your marvelously fruity rebellious alchemy of art jazz.\nIf someone has a room with lots of purple things,\na room that their kitty loves for all the sunshine in the morning.\nThey will likely say, here is my kitty,\nand please, make the atmosphere purple.\n\nThese are actually two separate things,\nclearly the kitty will be about realism.\nBut the purple, is where the kitty is posing from,\nthe atmosphere is the abstract part.\nPaint splatter, a purple nebula of textures,\nor a heart shaped hole in the wall...\nThat reveals not just the kitty,\nbut the universe it comes from.\n\nI would call this the balance of realism and the abstract,\nthe kitty is as realistic as it gets.\nBut all the other requests,\nall the customization are all about the abstract.\n\nGetting paid,\naside.\n\nRealism is still very hard to resist,\nand it may not be a good idea to fight it...\nSomehow, at the end of the day realism feels really good,\nand the more abstract works feel like they could be better.\nAnd it is rarely possible,\nto change course from surrealism, back to our universe, back to realism.\nBut it is trivial, nay, it is fun,\nto get the realism done first, and then build the abstract around it.\n\nAll I am saying is, that there is inextinguishable fire,\nin a work with realism at it heart.\n\nMixing money and art is a terrible thing,\nthat is why we have to divide the two apart.\nWe just have to know, right at the beginning,\naha, this is a work of art that will pay my bills, $50 bucks is $50 bucks.\n\nOn the other end, we can say,\naha, this piece, is meant for a gallery, that I hope to exhibit at next year.\nAnd perhaps they'll take it along to a bigger show,\nand this kitty comes with a bigger price tag, $50,000, plus the notepad with sketches set at $75.\n\nThis way Art is still pure,\nbut it can also pay bills.\n\nBefore you get around to selling art,\nyou will need a consistent portfolio.\nDue to issues of copyright and fair use,\nwhich even got the artist behind the Obama HOPE poster in hot water[2], you must choose carefully.\nPersonally, I recommend that you settle on nine realistic portraits,\nwith a consistent abstract finish or twist.\nYour portfolio,\nis just a website with those nine works.\nYou will need a dot com name, which is about $12 per year,\nthis will allow you to switch services.\nYou can redirect to dribbble first, then setup a proper website,\nand then move somewhere else without anybody holding that name hostage.\n\nWhen setting up accounts on websites that offer custom portraits,\nI think you will find that even before they ask you for your bank details.\nThey will want to see, or glance at,\nyour portfolio.\nSo the first step is nine consistent portraits,\nthat will show your customers, and galleries that maybe interested, exactly what to expect.\n\nReddit Gets Drawn[3],\nhas a fantastic clause in their rules,\n\"By submitting a photo,\nsubmitters are agreeing that artists can distribute and sell work based on the photos uploaded.\"\nThe only small drawback I can see here is other artists,\nselling works or holding works in their portfolio based on the same model.\nI don't think that is a big problem,\nbut you can also paint your own selfies, that will be perfectly unique.\n\nOther than Etsy, I don't have any specific recommendations where to sell,\nbut I recommend searching the web[4] to discover new locations with better deals.\nIt is important to grasp the gravity of selling custom digital portraits,\nthese are products that are held in high esteem, perfectly personalized, that never need upgrades, recompilation, or security fixes.\nSelling custom portraits online is superior,\nto spending days writing custom code that demands frequent maintenance, and occasional security audits.\n\nAnd of course,\nArt is in a universe of its own.\nIt is,\none of Humanity's most wonderful traditions.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=so8sB25IL4o\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc3Egjpna8I\n[3]: https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/\n[4]: https://www.qwant.com/?client=opensearch&q=The+best+places+to+sell+design+online&t=web",

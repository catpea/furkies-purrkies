  <p>When working with graphite,<br>identify the darkest parts of your image first.</p>
  <p>That is where you should start with a middle pencil, like B or 2B,<br>don't go too dark, because B pencils can be oily and hard to erase.</p>
  <p>And don't press hard on your paper,<br>paper is a little miracle, you have to protect it.</p>
  <p>Don't scar your paper with indentations because once graphite gets into them,<br>it will be hard to erase without damaging the paper.</p>

  <p>But the main thing is that the darkest parts of your image,<br>or Mona Lisa's eyes, hold the entirety of the soul of your subject.</p>
  <p>This is why it is so important to actually have hard shadows in your source image,<br>art without shadow, ;leaves out too much.</p>
  <p>One of my commissions didn't have shadows,<br>and while it came out perfect, so much more could have been said if I had the shadows.</p>

  <p>And mind you, it is not possible to add shadow,<br>our faces actually have multiple looks.</p>
  <p>The impression people get when looking at you from the side,<br>and when looking at you from the front, cause to two distinct feelings.</p>
  <p>We actually merge all the different looks,<br>when we befriend a person, we learn to recognize them from all angles.</p>
  <p>But if all you have is a photo, you can't add shadow,<br>you won't be able to re-create the person in the photo, a stranger will come out.</p>

  <p>If you are doing fantasy art,<br>adding shadows is nothing.</p>
  <p>There are shadow reference books,<br>so you just doodle something close.</p>
  <p>But remember that art is about teaching,<br>and making friends, and not being stuck at home.</p>
  <p>Fantasy art,<br>is something you would do at work.</p>
  <p>When you are out in the real world,<br>you do real portraits.</p>
  <p>Or like now practice your Mona Lisa,<br>it won't take very long to put together a kit that will help you create portraits.</p>

  <p>The transition to live portraits,<br>is something you just go through without thinking about it.</p>
  <p>You will need some technology to do your model justice,<br>don't do freehand, you only come close and fluctuate constantly distorting and improving.</p>
  <p>A portrait,<br>is a way of recognizing the impossible beauty of another human being.</p>
  <p>These are people who mark milestones for you,<br>each time you capture their beauty, you grow in wisdom and light.</p>

  <p>You have to take a photo,<br>probably in a coffee shop.</p>
  <p>But one that is lit by the hard light of the sun.<br>so it has to be morning or evening.</p>
  <p>Then you have to use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/pico-projector/s?k=pico+projector">pico projector</a>,<br>to transfer their beauty to two dimensional paper, which should be huge.</p>
  <p>One of the beautiful things about portraits,<br>is that they are basically posters.</p>
  <p>Posters that that focus on capturing the soul of your Subject,<br>and bring light to their eyes, and lips.</p>

  <p>It is really helpful,<br>if you snap a photo during sunset, so that the sun will shortly move out of your way.</p>
  <p>Don't worry about having a bunch of art equipment with you,<br>you need it to create a fast portrait that does proper justice.</p>
  <p>You have to be a Photographer, Technologist, a Maverick, a Force of Nature,<br>and a teacher, you have to explain everything that you are doing along the way.</p>
  <p>Mount you pico projector above your big Drawing Paper,<br>maybe use a filter to increase contrast of your photo, to get the shadows out first.</p>
  <p>And then be ready, move quickly,<br>listen to your heart.</p>
  <p>Use a B pencil, to quickly get the shadows in,<br>and your biggest Tortillon to make them less pencil and more gradient.</p>
  <p>If you got a hard edge in there somewhere,<br>use an eraser, to re-create it.</p>
  <p>Eyes are the windows to the soul,<br>make sure to bring light to the bottom of the iris, just like Leonardo did for his Mona Lisa.</p>
  <p>The parts that seem empty,<br>are empty because there is nothing there.</p>
  <p>If you see an empty shoulder for example, but you still want that angle,<br>ask the person posing to touch their shoulder with their hand.</p>
  <p>But move quickly,<br>explain that most people need to meet up again for a new portrait.</p>
  <p>A portrait is an expedition,<br>and not all editions succeed at first.</p>

  <p>Sometimes if you have time you can do multiple sketches scattered throughout the paper,<br>this looks especially nice when you took multiple photos in multiple angles.</p>
  <p>And remember your signature,<br>mine was just a litter kitty cat with ears perked up.</p>
  <p>Ask if you can keep the photo photos,<br>and make a few more portraits this time for a local gallery.</p>

  <p>Please whatever you do,<br>don't do art at home.</p>
  <p>You have to go outside,<br>half of art is teaching others how to do it.</p>
  <p>The true connection to art is not the beauty you capture,<br>but all the different things you will learn about yourself, and others along the way.</p>

  <p>There is one more thing,<br>always be ready to give some of your kit away to whoever was made speechless by your art.</p>
  <p>Have an unfinished Mona Lisa at hand,<br>some extra pencils, and a mini kit, that you can just gift them.</p>

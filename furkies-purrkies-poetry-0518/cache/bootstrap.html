    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That is where you should start with a middle pencil, like B or 2B,<br>don't go too dark, because B pencils can be oily and hard to erase.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And don't press hard on your paper,<br>paper is a little miracle, you have to protect it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Don't scar your paper with indentations because once graphite gets into them,<br>it will be hard to erase without damaging the paper.</div>

  "text": "When working with graphite,\nidentify the darkest parts of your image first.\nThat is where you should start with a middle pencil, like B or 2B,\ndon't go too dark, because B pencils can be oily and hard to erase.\nAnd don't press hard on your paper,\npaper is a little miracle, you have to protect it.\nDon't scar your paper with indentations because once graphite gets into them,\nit will be hard to erase without damaging the paper.\n\nBut the main thing is that the darkest parts of your image,\nor Mona Lisa's eyes, hold the entirety of the soul of your subject.\nThis is why it is so important to actually have hard shadows in your source image,\nart without shadow, ;leaves out too much.\nOne of my commissions didn't have shadows,\nand while it came out perfect, so much more could have been said if I had the shadows.\n\nAnd mind you, it is not possible to add shadow,\nour faces actually have multiple looks.\nThe impression people get when looking at you from the side,\nand when looking at you from the front, cause to two distinct feelings.\nWe actually merge all the different looks,\nwhen we befriend a person, we learn to recognize them from all angles.\nBut if all you have is a photo, you can't add shadow,\nyou won't be able to re-create the person in the photo, a stranger will come out.\n\nIf you are doing fantasy art,\nadding shadows is nothing.\nThere are shadow reference books,\nso you just doodle something close.\nBut remember that art is about teaching,\nand making friends, and not being stuck at home.\nFantasy art,\nis something you would do at work.\nWhen you are out in the real world,\nyou do real portraits.\nOr like now practice your Mona Lisa,\nit won't take very long to put together a kit that will help you create portraits.\n\nThe transition to live portraits,\nis something you just go through without thinking about it.\nYou will need some technology to do your model justice,\ndon't do freehand, you only come close and fluctuate constantly distorting and improving.\nA portrait,\nis a way of recognizing the impossible beauty of another human being.\nThese are people who mark milestones for you,\neach time you capture their beauty, you grow in wisdom and light.\n\nYou have to take a photo,\nprobably in a coffee shop.\nBut one that is lit by the hard light of the sun.\nso it has to be morning or evening.\nThen you have to use a pico projector[1],\nto transfer their beauty to two dimensional paper, which should be huge.\nOne of the beautiful things about portraits,\nis that they are basically posters.\nPosters that that focus on capturing the soul of your Subject,\nand bring light to their eyes, and lips.\n\nIt is really helpful,\nif you snap a photo during sunset, so that the sun will shortly move out of your way.\nDon't worry about having a bunch of art equipment with you,\nyou need it to create a fast portrait that does proper justice.\nYou have to be a Photographer, Technologist, a Maverick, a Force of Nature,\nand a teacher, you have to explain everything that you are doing along the way.\nMount you pico projector above your big Drawing Paper,\nmaybe use a filter to increase contrast of your photo, to get the shadows out first.\nAnd then be ready, move quickly,\nlisten to your heart.\nUse a B pencil, to quickly get the shadows in,\nand your biggest Tortillon to make them less pencil and more gradient.\nIf you got a hard edge in there somewhere,\nuse an eraser, to re-create it.\nEyes are the windows to the soul,\nmake sure to bring light to the bottom of the iris, just like Leonardo did for his Mona Lisa.\nThe parts that seem empty,\nare empty because there is nothing there.\nIf you see an empty shoulder for example, but you still want that angle,\nask the person posing to touch their shoulder with their hand.\nBut move quickly,\nexplain that most people need to meet up again for a new portrait.\nA portrait is an expedition,\nand not all editions succeed at first.\n\nSometimes if you have time you can do multiple sketches scattered throughout the paper,\nthis looks especially nice when you took multiple photos in multiple angles.\nAnd remember your signature,\nmine was just a litter kitty cat with ears perked up.\nAsk if you can keep the photo photos,\nand make a few more portraits this time for a local gallery.\n\nPlease whatever you do,\ndon't do art at home.\nYou have to go outside,\nhalf of art is teaching others how to do it.\nThe true connection to art is not the beauty you capture,\nbut all the different things you will learn about yourself, and others along the way.\n\nThere is one more thing,\nalways be ready to give some of your kit away to whoever was made speechless by your art.\nHave an unfinished Mona Lisa at hand,\nsome extra pencils, and a mini kit, that you can just gift them.\n\nWe are all Born Artists,\nand we have to remind each other, to no end.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.amazon.com/pico-projector/s?k=pico+projector",

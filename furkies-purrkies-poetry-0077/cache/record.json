<br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We are used to thinking of ourselves as work horses,</div>\n  <div

class=\"paragraph\">But that is a temporary oversimplification just to keep visions clear,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">born of a finely tuned mind that can narrow all views down to the important bits.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Focus and selective attention is not a limitation of our mind,</div>\n  <div

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Every window, picture, appliance, and outlet, all the important knickknacks are all there,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we don't have memory problems, we don't need better brains.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The convergence that we need is not about integrating with technology,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but combining the good parts of our cultures, so that the world can learn towards Peace.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Without that shared wisdom, people are easily tricked to believe in conflict,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">into the belief that there are borders, and across borders they must fight.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">By not helping each other to understand how special and unique we each are,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there grows a vocal minority of machine like minds, that think in mechanical terms.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">They add to get more, they take to be more,</div>\n  <div

avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is OK to focus on just a few things so that we may grow, and grow in wisdom too,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but it is not OK to live in some narrow channel for simplicity sake.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It actually isn't OK to do things to simplify,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">complexity only moves in one direction.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There is nothing healthy that can be done to un-mix a cup of tea,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there is nothing useful to be found in moving backwards in time.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Complexity grows, and to make sense of growing complexity,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we cannot hope to simplify it, but rather adapt our minds to grasp it more efficiently.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The World must Go Forward, Move Forward,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">what needs to change is out Tolerance for Bad Ideas.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But growing up to the challenges of ever increasing complexity requires wisdom,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and wisdom cannot be manufactured, it must be grown.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Wisdom is a product of Love,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">not the Beating Heart, but the Human Capacity to Love

an Adult, by acting mature,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is to make a fool of yourself, probably while throwing away what makes you Beautiful.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section

complexity,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">a thing so powerful, that it may in some part, travel around it self in time.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\"

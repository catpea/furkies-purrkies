</div>\n  <div class=\"section\">\n    <p>Maybe come their golden age,</p>\n    <p>as Guggenheim shows their works.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"section\">\n    <p>They will speak of leaving bad ideas behind,</p>\n    <p>and sharing in all the good ones.</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"section\">\n    <p>How truly precious all our daily chores,</p>\n    <p>how it is these little ordinary

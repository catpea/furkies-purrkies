I would often murmur to myself,
"Reality is a brick wall".
Any and all that move against it,
will have a hard time.
Even in these treasured days,
when my poems run particularly wild, that, holds, true.

I now worry for People, Judges and Politicians,
because I know many move against the grain of reality, and some had their minds poisoned.
It is very sad,
but we must look to the future generations, and protect _them_ from gaining that tragic momentum.
The overall formula,
is simple.
Self Education will lead you to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,
Greatness will grant you the power to build a new class of schools and ignite the beginning of Real Education.
You now gain the ability to kindle the spirits of countless students,
help them understand the importance of fine education.
And have the guard it,
knowing that when we lose the height the previous generation reached, we will be damned to re-learn their lessons.
Once the Truly Educated reach the middle age,
an age of convergence will arrive.
Humanity, will grow up a little,
as all the cultures enhance themselves with fine wisdom and converge on Unity and Peace.
Without real and international education that knows no bounds,
the wold will become ever more divided.
The minds poisoned by the currents of dark ages and myriads of indoctrination, will yank us back, and choke us,
to prevent Peace, Unity, Prosperity, Wisdom, and Progress; and propagate Hate, Hunger, Poverty, Dark Ages, Divisions, Lies, and Manipulations.
Real Schools,
are the only way.
The faster we converge,
the less suffering, war, and regret.

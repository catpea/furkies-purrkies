Across the last two days,
I have put in a cautious six miles in 34 and 24 degree Fahrenheit weather.
I am in the middle of a small study of sample of one,
testing a crazy simple idea.
Is it better to jog...
in Winter, or Summer?
The answer is Winter,
it is better to run in winter.

In 2012 Stanford biologists H. Craig Heller and Dennis Grahn[1],
were performing some temperature control related experiments on humans.
Grahn stated: Your muscle cells are saying, You can't work that hard anymore, because if you do you're going to cook and die.
as all Stanford graduates - they invented a gadget.
Personally, I took to jogging in winter weather,
and it is much better than jogging in Summer.
In fact, I begun wondering if that free spirited Summer Jogging,
may perhaps be a bad idea.
Couple of years ago I remember wringing out my head bandanna on a summer evening jog,
it was completely saturated, and the amount of fluid was troubling.

Jogging in winter still involves sweating,
but one is not overheating as badly as on summer evenings.
If overheating becomes a problem,
you just put one of your clothing layers in your jogging backpack to cool down.
In winter, you have access to perfect temperature control,
and it is as easy as taking one of your layers of clothing off, or putting one on.

I wear two pairs of jogging pants,
but depending on wind chill it maybe a good idea to put on a pair or long shorts.
We all wondered why superman wore his underwear on the outside,
now it is our chance to do it, and probably get away with it too - if it is the same color as the pants.
And even at 34 degrees weather I wore gloves,
gloves are probably a must in colder weather.
I jog with light dumbbells,
so it certainly is a must for me.

I found that 24 to 34 Fahrenheit weather calls for four layers,
a-shirt, t-shirt, long sleeve, and a hoodie, with a proper hood that ties with a lace.
But I wore an athletic breathable long sleeve,
if it was warmer, I could put my hoodie away in 34 degree weather.
At a windless 34 degrees, I didn't need a hood, of face protection,
and I unzipped my hoodie, and it felt great.
At 24 degrees Fahrenheit, the hood saved me from cutting today's 4 mile jog short,
in addition, due to the wind, I put on a medical mask to warm my face up.
For a moment during the windy 24 degree jog, when turning around to face the cold wind.
I regretted not packing a thin wind breaker.
I would probably put it on in addition to the hoodie,
and 20 degree weather would absolutely call for it - the hoodie alone would not be enough for 20 degree weather.

Jut to clarify and summarize upper body layers that maybe needed for 20 degree weather,
a-shirt, t-shirt, thick long sleeve, hoodie, and a wind breaker.
In windless 35 degree weather you may not need the hoodie,
and won't need the thin wind breaker.

Everyone has a wind breaker, hoodie and a warm shirt,
what is missing at least from my wardrobe is a thermal ski mask[2], which is extremely important.
Ski masks, thankfully have evolved not to look like what robbers wear,
wearing shorts on the outside and a bandit ski mask, would probably cross some line.
If the weather gets any colder, which could be due to wind chill,
then ski googles[3] may also be a good idea.
The thermal ski mask and cool ski goggles,
completely protect the face from the cold.
Gloves, long selves, and long pants, ski mask and googles,
cover head to toe.
If you don't have one get a packable (which is to say) lightweight bag[4] for adapting the layers on the go,
phone, wallet, some water, goggles, and other gear.
Variable layer that the backpack enables,
create ultimate comfort for winter jogging.

My research continues,
as I am waiting for few inches of snow and some slippery ice.
But I am certain that if you enjoy jogging in the Summer,
you will love jogging in the Winter - stay safe.

  <p>Across the last two days,<br>I have put in a cautious six miles in 34 and 24 degree Fahrenheit weather.</p>
  <p>I am in the middle of a small study of sample of one,<br>testing a crazy simple idea.</p>
  <p>Is it better to jog...<br>in Winter, or Summer?</p>
  <p>The answer is Winter,<br>it is better to run in winter.</p>

  <p>In 2012 <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2012/08/29/cooling-glove-research-082912/">Stanford biologists H. Craig Heller and Dennis Grahn</a>,<br>were performing some temperature control related experiments on humans.</p>
  <p>Grahn stated: Your muscle cells are saying, You can't work that hard anymore, because if you do you're going to cook and die.<br>as all Stanford graduates - they invented a gadget.</p>
  <p>Personally, I took to jogging in winter weather,<br>and <strong>it is</strong> much better than jogging in Summer.</p>
  <p>In fact, I begun wondering if that free spirited Summer Jogging,<br>may perhaps be a bad idea.</p>
  <p>Couple of years ago I remember wringing out my head bandanna on a summer evening jog,<br>it was completely saturated, and the amount of fluid was troubling.</p>

  <p>Jogging in winter still involves sweating,<br>but one is not overheating as badly as on summer evenings.</p>
  <p>If overheating becomes a problem,<br>you just put one of your clothing layers in your jogging backpack to cool down.</p>
  <p>In winter, you have access to perfect temperature control,<br>and it is as easy as taking one of your layers of clothing off, or putting one on.</p>

  <p>I wear two pairs of jogging pants,<br>but depending on wind chill it maybe a good idea to put on a pair or long shorts.</p>
  <p>We all wondered why superman wore his underwear on the outside,<br>now it is our chance to do it, and probably get away with it too - if it is the same color as the pants.</p>
  <p>And even at 34 degrees weather I wore gloves,<br>gloves are probably a must in colder weather.</p>
  <p>I jog with light dumbbells,<br>so it certainly is a must for me.</p>

  <p>I found that 24 to 34 Fahrenheit weather calls for four layers,<br>a-shirt, t-shirt, long sleeve, and a hoodie, with a proper hood that ties with a lace.</p>
  <p>But I wore an athletic breathable long sleeve,<br>if it was warmer, I could put my hoodie away in 34 degree weather.</p>
  <p>At a windless 34 degrees, I didn't need a hood, of face protection,<br>and I unzipped my hoodie, and it felt great.</p>
  <p>At 24 degrees Fahrenheit, the hood saved me from cutting today's 4 mile jog short,<br>in addition, due to the wind, I put on a medical mask to warm my face up.</p>
  <p>For a moment during the windy 24 degree jog, when turning around to face the cold wind.<br>I regretted not packing a thin wind breaker.</p>
  <p>I would probably put it on in addition to the hoodie,<br>and 20 degree weather would absolutely call for it - the hoodie alone would not be enough for 20 degree weather.</p>

  <p>Jut to clarify and summarize upper body layers that maybe needed for 20 degree weather,<br>a-shirt, t-shirt, thick long sleeve, hoodie, and a wind breaker.</p>
  <p>In windless 35 degree weather you may not need the hoodie,<br>and won't need the thin wind breaker.</p>

  <p>Everyone has a wind breaker, hoodie and a warm shirt,<br>what is missing at least from my wardrobe is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thermal+ski+mask">thermal ski mask</a>, which is extremely important.</p>
  <p>Ski masks, thankfully have evolved not to look like what robbers wear,<br>wearing shorts on the outside and a bandit ski mask, would probably cross some line.</p>
  <p>If the weather gets any colder, which could be due to wind chill,<br>then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ski+eye+goggles">ski googles</a> may also be a good idea.</p>
  <p>The thermal ski mask and cool ski goggles,<br>completely protect the face from the cold.</p>
  <p>Gloves, long selves, and long pants, ski mask and googles,<br>cover head to toe.</p>
  <p>If you don't have one get a packable (which is to say) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=small+light+backpack+breathable+packable">lightweight bag</a> for adapting the layers on the go,<br>phone, wallet, some water, goggles, and other gear.</p>
  <p>Variable layer that the backpack enables,<br>create ultimate comfort for winter jogging.</p>

  <p>My research continues,<br>as I am waiting for few inches of snow and some slippery ice.</p>
  <p>But I am certain that if you enjoy jogging in the Summer,<br>you will love jogging in the Winter - stay safe.</p>

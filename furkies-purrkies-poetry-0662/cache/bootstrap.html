    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Across the last two days,<br>I have put in a cautious six miles in 34 and 24 degree Fahrenheit weather.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I am in the middle of a small study of sample of one,<br>testing a crazy simple idea.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Is it better to jog...<br>in Winter, or Summer?</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The answer is Winter,<br>it is better to run in winter.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In 2012 <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2012/08/29/cooling-glove-research-082912/">Stanford biologists H. Craig Heller and Dennis Grahn</a>,<br>were performing some temperature control related experiments on humans.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Grahn stated: Your muscle cells are saying, You can't work that hard anymore, because if you do you're going to cook and die.<br>as all Stanford graduates - they invented a gadget.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Personally, I took to jogging in winter weather,<br>and <strong>it is</strong> much better than jogging in Summer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In fact, I begun wondering if that free spirited Summer Jogging,<br>may perhaps be a bad idea.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Couple of years ago I remember wringing out my head bandanna on a summer evening jog,<br>it was completely saturated, and the amount of fluid was troubling.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Jogging in winter still involves sweating,<br>but one is not overheating as badly as on summer evenings.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If overheating becomes a problem,<br>you just put one of your clothing layers in your jogging backpack to cool down.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In winter, you have access to perfect temperature control,<br>and it is as easy as taking one of your layers of clothing off, or putting one on.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I wear two pairs of jogging pants,<br>but depending on wind chill it maybe a good idea to put on a pair or long shorts.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We all wondered why superman wore his underwear on the outside,<br>now it is our chance to do it, and probably get away with it too - if it is the same color as the pants.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And even at 34 degrees weather I wore gloves,<br>gloves are probably a must in colder weather.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I jog with light dumbbells,<br>so it certainly is a must for me.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I found that 24 to 34 Fahrenheit weather calls for four layers,<br>a-shirt, t-shirt, long sleeve, and a hoodie, with a proper hood that ties with a lace.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But I wore an athletic breathable long sleeve,<br>if it was warmer, I could put my hoodie away in 34 degree weather.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At a windless 34 degrees, I didn't need a hood, of face protection,<br>and I unzipped my hoodie, and it felt great.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At 24 degrees Fahrenheit, the hood saved me from cutting today's 4 mile jog short,<br>in addition, due to the wind, I put on a medical mask to warm my face up.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For a moment during the windy 24 degree jog, when turning around to face the cold wind.<br>I regretted not packing a thin wind breaker.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I would probably put it on in addition to the hoodie,<br>and 20 degree weather would absolutely call for it - the hoodie alone would not be enough for 20 degree weather.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In windless 35 degree weather you may not need the hoodie,<br>and won't need the thin wind breaker.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Everyone has a wind breaker, hoodie and a warm shirt,<br>what is missing at least from my wardrobe is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=thermal+ski+mask">thermal ski mask</a>, which is extremely important.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Ski masks, thankfully have evolved not to look like what robbers wear,<br>wearing shorts on the outside and a bandit ski mask, would probably cross some line.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If the weather gets any colder, which could be due to wind chill,<br>then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ski+eye+goggles">ski googles</a> may also be a good idea.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you don't have one get a packable (which is to say) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=small+light+backpack+breathable+packable">lightweight bag</a> for adapting the layers on the go,<br>phone, wallet, some water, goggles, and other gear.</div>

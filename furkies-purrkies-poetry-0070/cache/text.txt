Wherever I went, Friday magically followed,
there always seem to have been a tree that was hollowed,

And the moment I looked at food,
he knew, dinner was going to be good.

Wherever the Raccoons came out at night,
Friday, was always there, my Fat Spirit Guide.

<!-- Keys -->

Over at Little Torch Key, at Veterans Beach, with easy access to water,
he lived up a Palm Tree, with his Furry Wife and Tiny Daughter,

Once I got lonely, and threw a little Tortilla all the way up there,
he popped up, and it looked like he smiled - I swear.

<!-- Jack Pine -->

Over at Ludington State Park, at the Jack Pine Hike-in Campground,
I woke up at 3 am, hearing a strange sound.

He was trying to pull out my hamburger buns,
probably to feed all his furry sons.

The bag was tied, up in a tree,
nothing could stop him - Because he was free.

I got out of my tent, and delivered his late night bite,
by tossing it into my cranky neighbor's camp site.

<!-- Nordhouse -->

The whole woodland family, knew that eventually I had to go back,
Friday left a little footprint on my pillow, to help me pack.

I was staying up in the trees, on top of ancient dunes,
the only light was that of stars, and the moon's.

I called them [Nordhouse Skylands][1],
but, if you go out there, be ready for his smart little hands,

Bring a travel lock to secure the zippers on your tent,
and remember, Friday loves you as friend, he means no ill intent.

My Dear Readers, we may each need a few weeks of Wilderness in our life,
so start slowly packing, buy a backpack, bug spray, and a knife,

And just keep your adventure pack by the door,
if life ever gets you down, smile! and head for that Lake Michigan shore.

You can park at the [Nurnberg Trailhead][2],
and don't forget to bring a little bit of stinky cheese,
and piece of stale bread.

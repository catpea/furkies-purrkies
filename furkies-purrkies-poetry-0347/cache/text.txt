We all have to be careful about what we end up believing in,
and we have to be good to ourselves taking care of our minds and bodies.

Our greatest flaw,
is our susceptibility to indoctrination.

We have a tendency,
to believe whatever it is that we are born into,

We must get ahead of all that,
we have to verify, we have to check our beliefs.

We have to make sure that who we become, come our golden age,
does us justice, and that our world is good to us.

We have to care about our mind,
we have to take to self education.

There is nobody we can trust, with our finest work,
the content of our character.

And we have to keep our stress levels to minimum,
we need our brain to work for us not against us.

When you look at institutions, and governments,
do not be disenchanted by how little progress they make.

Instead see that they are just little pebbles,
where our great stepping stones should be.

Together, we have to build so big,
that liars will be prevented from thriving in the systems we build.

As to everything else,
it is moving in the right direction.

To make it move faster,
the world needs more Understanding, more Wisdom, more Greatness.

And that;
is in your hands.

It is the content of character of every generation,
that influences the world the most.

Countries can only make fast progress,
when their people aim for Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.

That is a journey we should all make,
slowly, cheerfully.

And with the certainty of knowing that,
this is the most enlightening and healthiest path.

I think this is a big part of growing up,
both for individuals and Humanity.

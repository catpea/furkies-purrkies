  <p>When they have something interesting to 3D print.<br>a lot of former Europeans camp-out by their printer to squint.</p>
  <p>It is a kind of lovely robot love,<br>that they don’t want to get rid of.</p>
  <p>Monitoring the new 3D printer tech,<br>is a fun as watching a Cute Chicken peck.</p>

  <p>A 3D printer is an excellent robot friend,<br>so 3D printing becomes a ritual they want to attend.</p>
  <p>Sometimes a print may a looong time,<br>so many take to writing rhyme.</p>

  <p>But make to mistake they love waiting,<br>watching a print is supremely captivating.</p>
  <p>Make some tea, mix some coco,<br>and watch the printer squirt out the gizmo.</p>
  <p>The first layer makes everyone nervous,<br>because, if, it is way-off, the “hot end” may need service.</p>
  <p>Most often it is a bed leveling issue,<br>and hopefully they have an auto-leveling kit or they’ll need a tissue.</p>

  <p>But our lovely robot,<br>does magic quite a lot.</p>
  <p>It is the marvelous chicken,<br>that’s always ticking.</p>
  <p>--</p>
  <p>Once it begins printing the honey comb foundation,<br>creating a feeling of elation.</p>
  <p>You don't need to squint,<br>to see that it is beauUutiful inside a 3D print.</p>
  <p>And if your mittens are nimble,<br>you can probably drop something in there as a symbol.</p>

  <p>Just to be sure,<br>many, first print a little miniature.</p>
  <p>A midget version of their invention,<br>on a much smaller dimension.</p>
  <p>It is just as exciting,<br>and the idea of saving time and filament can be quite inviting.</p>

  <p>Sitting down next to a printer that one can admire,<br>is very much like relaxing by a happy bonfire.</p>
  <p>Never mind the duration,<br>that chicken is pecking out your magnificent creation.</p>
  <p>It is the most fascinating thing in the universe,<br>even more fascinating... than this strange verse.</p>

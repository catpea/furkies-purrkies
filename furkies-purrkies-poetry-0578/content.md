Step One.

---

I suspect it maybe difficult to __just__ become a writer,
I think you must first have something important to say to the world, writing is just kind of the way you say it.

Understand what Greatness is and why you need it, Greatness does not make you successful, or worthy a following,
greatness makes you small, it makes you cry,

You see yourself across time,
like a Hollywood movie from where you begin to where you retire.

But you also see your mind before your time,
it was nowhere in particular and it didn't suffer.

You also see the eddies you created,
your little things that cheerfully keep going on some other timescale.

---

And here you see Humanity's Mistakes,
and the mistakes that Humanity does not yet know it is making.

There is nothing here that will make you feel great,
that will make you tower.

Greatness just helps you see; and slightly unravels the worlds mistakes,
the more grownups the less energy to propagate mistakes.

Greatness is an adaptive force,
it bypasses all the negative and wraps it, it attacks it and consumes it.

It then [burps with colorful songs][1],
and [makes us cry with touching triumphs][2].

---

Greatness may make you feel small,
but it also makes you indestructible and unforgettable.

It makes it so that your Elder Self won't have any regrets,
that you will travel the wisest and most cheerful paths in life.

---

Step Two

---

Build a proper expedition backpack,
piece by piece, daydream by daydream.

On a particularly awful Monday,
try to shop for a little stove that would boil your tea, and re-hydrate powdered creations.

On a Tuesday, where things drag,
see about a hammock, they pack well and help you dangle, get one with a mosquito net.

On a Wednesday after another deafening meeting,
treat yourself to a knife, try to find a really expensive one with a thick blade.

On a rainy Thursday,
see about a sleeping mat, and a fluffy puffy bag, and try to imagine what it would be like to sleep in the woods.

On a cheerful Friday,
get some of those freeze dried meals and cook them at home, and make sure to pick good spices to give them flavor.

On a restful Saturday,
away from the chaos and nonsense unwind shopping for thick socks and the most expensive hiking boots that will last a decade.

And on a Sunday before a crappy new meeting,
[set it all up in your living room and see if you can find some nature sounds][3] to take a tiny nap to.


You'll never stray too far,
the nature is just the grab of handle away.

Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, Continental Divide Trail,
it is all yours.

It will make you slow down,
and regain your balance, remember your childhood dreams and restore your brilliance if tarnished with overwork.

---

Don't forget your journals, bring bug spray,
and get some bear spray.

Bear spray is great for when you feel like fantasizing about squirting,
the person that got you fired and sent you into the middle of woods, how dare he.

As you reach the end of your first trail,
it won't be long before you are frolicking the next one to finish your second biography and start a new travel and adventure volume.

---

Step Three.

---

Keep balance in your life;
no more overwork.

Get serious about Halloween costumes, creating the tastiest spring rolls and learning how to dance...
and frequently bellow in laughter.

Help your friends and strangers escape their jobs, and all the pointers hops through academic hoops,
help them to enlightenment.

Help them to find interesting lectures,
and beautiful narrated books, help them to long nature walks among Cheerful Chipmunks and Silly Raccoon, and Charging Bears.

Help them slow down in life,
and remind them to keep learning and rising, and building their knowledge to no end in sight.

Take the wisdom you love the most,
and share.

The more precious your message,
the mightier your book.

  <p>Do things that that you move you,<br>that upon completion expand your view.</p>
  <p>When you are young the aim is to rise,<br>and not all things need be wise.</p>
  <p>You can even be artistic and somewhat obscene,<br>chalk London with curse words and make a big scene.</p>
  <p>So as long as you don't get caught and the chalk comes from the White Cliffs of Dover,<br>you'll become as famous as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Az9ttLyQe9E">Banksy</a> before it is over.</p>

  <p>Read many books on your way to your middle age,<br>and wisdom will take the center stage.</p>
  <p>Your beautifully foolish Guerrilla Art,<br>will transform into many things that are very smart.</p>
  <p>Stay on the trails,<br>and bring back many tales.</p>
  <p>Pacific Crest Trail is great for growing wise,<br>all those sunsets make for beautiful skies.</p>
  <p>This is about a strong connection,<br>and a single Human direction.</p>
  <p>When wisdom fills your middle life,<br>in your golden age, it will cut through questions like a knife.</p>

  <p>Make sure that you sail most of the seas,<br>and enjoy the fragrant breeze.</p>
  <p>If I may, eat a fried European flounder on a stick,<br>the salt of the Baltic Sea gives it a fiiine kick.</p>

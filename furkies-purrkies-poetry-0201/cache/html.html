  <p>There was a little lady that figured out how to change the world,</p>
  <p>all that is known, is that she wasn&apos;t very old.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>She posted a single long video, that opened with &quot;I don&apos;t want to be a bother,&quot;</p>
  <p>today, everyone just calls her, Mum or Mother.</p>

  <p>She said that Democracies require educated voters to operate,</p>
  <p>that without real education a Democracy can fill with hate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>&quot;A democratic majority consensus is a really big deal,</p>
  <p>without a consensus a nation will always suffer and never heal.&quot;</p>

  <p>She spoke of the blight of Fake Education,</p>
  <p>she said it lasted long enough to bring her nation down into great desperation.</p>

  <p>The video was several hours long,</p>
  <p>it showed her computer programs and how they brought the world together to get along.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>She showed how Nations can invest into the futures of their kids,</p>
  <p>creating educational paths with rewards and bids.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Game companies inspired by her imagination,</p>
  <p>built it all, her entire virtual nation.</p>

  <p>Slowly one by one, cities around the word adopted her program,</p>
  <p>to this day it is still true to the original diagram.</p>

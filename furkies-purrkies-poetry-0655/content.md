It is not possible to learn within a preset time period,
nor is it possible to learn following some curriculum.

Even in self education we can't expect to just finish a subject on time,
we may need to stop for several weeks, for any number of reasons.

Though the way we dictate our own path in self education,
is perfect.

Schools need to use computers to allow students to build their own path,
and as an extension of this self directed learning, the students will learn at the correct pace.

---

This is just the top of the iceberg,
the consequences of preset time divisions and prearranged curricula are devastating.

By forcing students to learn at a specific pace, and in a specific sequence,
we turn them away from education.

But it gets even worse, because we then grade them down,
and convince them that they are not smart.

Not as smart as the kids that are just memorizing,
with minimal comprehension.

---

To add insult to injury,
the teachers may not be aware they are preventing real education.

And when cornered about it, they may just say,
"How were we supposed to know."

---

It is important to admit that schools are not working,
and that grades are neither correct not a judgment of intelligence.

Just look at the teachers, surely they were A grade students,
they have little idea that they are not only failing, but preventing real education as well.

In their misunderstanding,
they are convincing children that they can't learn as well as the smart kids.

A lot of students will not pick up a book after that,
they will not try to learn.

They will never figure out that schools were broken,
that they were sold out for paychecks...

But convinced they are not smart,
for no reason at all.

---

There may not be any change on the way,
schools may permanently stay the way they are.

[We used to talk about saving the Amazon, but there was no change, just talk][1],
[we lost 20 percent of the Amazon in 45 years][2].

Young people have to understand,
that reason is not the driving force - and we need reason to survive into the future.

Schools are a beautiful idea, in terms of reason,
but fake schools are a beautiful idea in terms of money.

Same as with the Rain Forest of Brazil, saving it is beautiful in terms or reason,
destroying it for short term money, is more fetching to people wanting to escape poverty.

---

Education is very special, because proper education,
will protect the world and help our civilization grow.

Without real education people can't see the wrongs,
with real education we can correct our mistakes before it is too late.

With real education the world would probably create a Universal Income programme,
that would prevent farmers from clearing the land.

There is a Kurt Vonnegut quote that I want to mention in closing,
"True terror is to wake up one morning and realize that your high school class is running the country."

We need to understand this,
correctly.

First of all, forget today's politicians, they will soon retire,
the students of today; are future politicians.

And they need real education to repair the world,
broken by the uneducated, who live in a fantasy world, and don't what happens to the world after they pass.

This means that laws must be created with future generations in mind,
and this requires reality based lifestyles, real thinking, real education, real wisdom, and real greatness.

This means that children of today need a real education,
as they will be inheriting a broken world that will require greatness of mind to fix.

It means that we can't pretend to get an education,
we need real education instead.

We need self education,
because fake diploma-based education cannot be tolerated, as it means nothing.

In the absence of real teachers,
we must become the teachers.

Powerful, reality based, self education must come first,
real knowledge will beget wisdom, and wisdom will beget greatness.

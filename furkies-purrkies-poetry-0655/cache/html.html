  <p>It is not possible to learn within a preset time period,<br>nor is it possible to learn following some curriculum.</p>
  <p>Even in self education we can't expect to just finish a subject on time,<br>we may need to stop for several weeks, for any number of reasons.</p>
  <p>Though the way we dictate our own path in self education,<br>is perfect.</p>
  <p>Schools need to use computers to allow students to build their own path,<br>and as an extension of this self directed learning, the students will learn at the correct pace.</p>

  <p>This is just the top of the iceberg,<br>the consequences of preset time divisions and prearranged curricula are devastating.</p>
  <p>By forcing students to learn at a specific pace, and in a specific sequence,<br>we turn them away from education.</p>
  <p>But it gets even worse, because we then grade them down,<br>and convince them that they are not smart.</p>
  <p>Not as smart as the kids that are just memorizing,<br>with minimal comprehension.</p>

  <p>To add insult to injury,<br>the teachers may not be aware they are preventing real education.</p>
  <p>And when cornered about it, they may just say,<br>"How were we supposed to know."</p>

  <p>It is important to admit that schools are not working,<br>and that grades are neither correct not a judgment of intelligence.</p>
  <p>Just look at the teachers, surely they were A grade students,<br>they have little idea that they are not only failing, but preventing real education as well.</p>
  <p>In their misunderstanding,<br>they are convincing children that they can't learn as well as the smart kids.</p>
  <p>A lot of students will not pick up a book after that,<br>they will not try to learn.</p>
  <p>They will never figure out that schools were broken,<br>that they were sold out for paychecks...</p>
  <p>But convinced they are not smart,<br>for no reason at all.</p>

  <p>There may not be any change on the way,<br>schools may permanently stay the way they are.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9zWDtDKDS8">We used to talk about saving the Amazon, but there was no change, just talk</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_fXokyqeQ8">we lost 20 percent of the Amazon in 45 years</a>.</p>
  <p>Young people have to understand,<br>that reason is not the driving force - and we need reason to survive into the future.</p>
  <p>Schools are a beautiful idea, in terms of reason,<br>but fake schools are a beautiful idea in terms of money.</p>
  <p>Same as with the Rain Forest of Brazil, saving it is beautiful in terms or reason,<br>destroying it for short term money, is more fetching to people wanting to escape poverty.</p>

  <p>Education is very special, because proper education,<br>will protect the world and help our civilization grow.</p>
  <p>Without real education people can't see the wrongs,<br>with real education we can correct our mistakes before it is too late.</p>
  <p>With real education the world would probably create a Universal Income programme,<br>that would prevent farmers from clearing the land.</p>

  <p>There is a Kurt Vonnegut quote that I want to mention in closing,<br>"True terror is to wake up one morning and realize that your high school class is running the country."</p>
  <p>We need to understand this,<br>correctly.</p>
  <p>First of all, forget today's politicians, they will soon retire,<br>the students of today; are future politicians.</p>
  <p>And they need real education to repair the world,<br>broken by the uneducated, who live in a fantasy world, and don't what happens to the world after they pass.</p>
  <p>This means that laws must be created with future generations in mind,<br>and this requires reality based lifestyles, real thinking, real education, real wisdom, and real greatness.</p>
  <p>This means that children of today need a real education,<br>as they will be inheriting a broken world that will require greatness of mind to fix.</p>
  <p>It means that we can't pretend to get an education,<br>we need real education instead.</p>
  <p>We need self education,<br>because fake diploma-based education cannot be tolerated, as it means nothing.</p>
  <p>In the absence of real teachers,<br>we must become the teachers.</p>
  <p>Powerful, reality based, self education must come first,<br>real knowledge will beget wisdom, and wisdom will beget greatness.</p>

  <p>I think the first step should always be an Art Portfolio,<br>because businesses that sell art online for you, will ask to see it.</p>
  <p>And I think it should be consistent in some way,<br>it should say: "This is what you can expect from me."</p>
  <p>You should start simple,<br>but you don't have to <strong>keep</strong> it simple.</p>

  <p>I love Pop Surrealism,<br>so I would make photo realistic caricatures.</p>
  <p>But you can do any technique,<br>though you may need to do 3 works per technique.</p>

  <p>Although portraits are probably the quickest way,<br>to show how realistic your art is.</p>
  <p>Urban life scenes, Nature and Still life photography,<br>are also a great source of color and shape for your paintings.</p>
  <p>And you can grab an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Action+Figure+Drawing+Model">Action Figure Drawing Model</a>,<br>to use as reference as well.</p>

  <p>The standard wooden mannequin and hand,<br>actually go together, you pose the mannequin first...</p>
  <p>And once you ready for hand details; you pose the hand to fit your mannequin pose,<br>take a bunch of photos and splice a unique scene together with tone and shape reference.</p>
  <p>Learning blender, or 3D modeling in general is another source of tone or shadow,<br>and programs like MakeHuman will help you with posing your characters.</p>

  <p>Overall, whatever you will focus on,<br>will teach you how to do it well in no time.</p>
  <p>Painting faces with the aid of Krita's Image Reference tool, and reference images covering the entire canvas,<br>will teach you the features of a face in a way no teacher can.</p>
  <p>Digital painting is extremely advanced,<br>not many artists get it yet.</p>

  <p>If becoming a professional artist is the aim,<br>using reference tools will enhance the quality of your work.</p>
  <p>It will protect you from ever getting stuck,<br>and help you get all the details right; the first time.</p>
  <p>You can use a grid to transfer photo onto a real canvas,<br>but using a grid on your computer, is just adding extra steps to a simple process.</p>

  <p>Digital art it helps you with color and shape,<br>so that you can innovate beyond it.</p>
  <p>So that you can do things that would be too difficult or impossible,<br>on a standard canvas.</p>
  <p>There are so many directions you can choose that it is impossible to make useful recommendations,<br>move slowly and take to things that call to you; and you'll invent a whole new universe, in no time.</p>

And trhat is when the young student knew,
what he had to do

And the moral of the story is,
if you attempt to take art away.

Be it out of ignorance, or arrogance, or to feel special,
or just to line your own pockets by selling out your students.

The legacy and reputation you will leave behind,
will be that of a fool - never stand in the way of art.

As you can imagine we can fingerprint a file based on its content,
and then no matter how many times it is copied, we only really have one copy.

Over and over I see files that already exist on hard drives being copied, and copied, and copied,
the so called best programmers in the world, can't fix this.

And when they say they fixed it,
just ask them if this "fix" is in the room with them, and beat them accordingly.

I never got to fixing the server this morning,
the moment my toe touched the carpet as I was dancing out of my bed, I heard the server crash.

And sure as heck, a moment later, I was looking at a 15GB download from github, now owned by microsoft,
throttled, rate limited, bandwidth constrained, 15GB t*d, that was just total garbage I didn't eve want to see.

It was literally the contents of my recycle bin,
it was over a 100,000 files I never wanted to see again.

They exist because when one intelligent programmer codes everything is great,
everything is great, except his real project ETA is way past the heat death of the universe.

And when a boss shows up, and decides to cut the project ETA in half by adding another intelligent programmer,
they actually crate a very counter productive situation.

Because now the second programmer, will create a complex system,
that will cancel out any and all intelligence.

And adding a third programmer, and beyond,
actually create a chaotic system, equal to that of monkeys typing on a typewriter at random.

Here instead of the heat death of the universe we finally approach the real time scale,
the forking infinity.

If you have enough monkeys and bosses, doing random shit for long enough,
you will achieve everything.

We are currently at 12% or my fourth attempt at fixing the website,
the previous three attempts were all as different as it gets, bout would take many hours.

And I have just about two, so that I finish by 11PM,
it is currently 11AM - and yes, my time estimates are impeccable.

The thing is, it is not really 12% because my previous attempts already burned up,
secret quota, and alloyed bytes, and bot triggers, and I am probably ready flagged for review.

They will disable any build processes,
and ask me to leave the free service, or pay, for more of this.

We are at 100% of the first step of repair moving onto the second,
this company will now download the huge thing that I am probably already flagged for.

All of it, even though all these files already exist on their system,
it is just an optimized version of the website.

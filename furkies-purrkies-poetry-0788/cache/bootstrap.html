    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is no good reason why there should be a large gap,<br>when you turn off you line art.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The color of the eyeball and the color of the face,<br>should almost touch.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You should be able to tun off the lines in your illustration,<br>and not see holes where the lines were.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Another alternative is,<br>is not to use the selection tool.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just use a standard brush,<br>and paint over your line art like a normal person.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This does not mean you are eliminating your line art,<br>because once you are done painting...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You can move the line art layer above it.<br>there are no holes here, no problems.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You end up with an illustration that can have strong outlines,<br>or no lines at all, just gradients you painted.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But the problem here is that you have to be careful not to go over the line,<br>which is what the contiguous selection tool can help you with.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The best approach,<br>is a fusion of both.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Use the contiguous selection tool, along with grow selection under Select menu,<br>and paint over you line art.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So here the selection tool,<br>allows you not to worry about going over the line...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And manually growing it will help you stack your layers,<br>without any holes, and in a way that is compatible with your line art.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So that you can bring it back,<br>above your painting, if you wish.</div>

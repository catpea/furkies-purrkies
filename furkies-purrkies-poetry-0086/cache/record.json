  "text": "Our minds constantly construct boundaries,\nand constantly try to make us comfortable.\nBut in an evolved world this works against us,\nit creates boundaries across which we hope to discharge pain.\nThe source of the pain is poverty, poverty of mind and wallet,\nfear, pain, unfairness and inequality, add to the blindness.\nThere is no solution on the level where poverty reins,\nit will always be walls turning people against each other.\nWe are not ready for the next level,\nin the next level we recognize poverty as a virus.\nWe see it as a Natural Disaster,\nwe sit back, relax, calm down, print enough money to end it and move on.\nThis does not mean everyone is going to be rich,\nit only means, nobody will be stuck in financial poverty.\nPoverty of mind, the other half of poverty is not even up for discussion,\nnot until everyone has a safe home.\nAll of this seems impossible, to many laughable,\nirrational, infantile, unfair even.\nFor those of you who don't understand how someone could possibly call this unfair,\nsome will angrily yell \"Why should someone get a free home, when I worked for mine, my entire life?\".\n\nThis is the Nature of the Walls,\nthe picture of the great divide.\nA divide between who we are today,\nand who we should be tomorrow.\n\nA Human Being is so special,\nthat they may not exist without their own Home, not just a house.\nSo special, that active countermeasures must be put in place,\nto help people move away from bad ideas.\nA Human Being is so special, that they must never grow up in fear,\nthat they must never be lied to, never manipulated.\nThey must never be pressured, never become stressed or depressed,\nminds are delicate and must be protected.\n\nWe can't see that, because the walls are invisible,\nwe often can't see that with which we grow up with.\nEmboldened we dare to hold up our opinion,\nas if it was on par with a Great Being's carefully observed fact, or wisdom.\n\nCrushed, stressed, pressured, tired,\nwe temporarily lose our mind.\nThe thing that makes Humans Special,\ncan be turned off by tiredness and stress.\nAnd our brains go into Stupid Mode,\nA versus B, A lesser/better B.\nAnd it seems like we are still operating,\nbut that's just an illusion, that not us, at all.\n\nI don't know how long it will take us to see how special we are,\nhow many gaps need to be crossed, or how many upgrades our Cultures need.\nI know that divided, the generations will always fight across pointless walls,\nand I know that without unity, the world will not progress.\n\nThe children are watching,\nthey are always watching.\nThey will emulate what they see,\nthey will accept it as reality.\nThey will add to the invisible walls,\nand dismiss others to discharge pain, or stress.\n\nWe can't have a discussion about any of this,\nuntil stress of poverty is out of the picture.\nIt will be one of the Humanity's greatest achievements,\nto help everyone wake up to a home, with enough food, and a world that cares.\nUntil that moment comes,\nwe can't have a conversation with all.\nWhether we are ready to know it, or not,\nthe way the world grows... it's either all of us, on none.",

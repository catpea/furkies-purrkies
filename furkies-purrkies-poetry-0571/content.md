If the teacher says “I will be unfair, because of reasons”,
you get up and leave because of reasons, head for the library where the real teachers are.

You don’t sit there stressing out about some pop-quiz,
or something unfair, or fake, or unusual, or stupid.

You don’t cry, you don’t let the bullies near you,
you don’t jump hoops, you don’t perform for your parents.

---

The truth about being under attack is that you are letting them attack you,
you are not allowed to do that.

And I understand that parents will will ask you to move out,
if you don’t like what they are saying.

It happens to a lot of us,
and a lot of kids who are put in that situation end up in a lot of trouble.

If your parents are manipulating you, speak out,
tell grand ma, tell aunt, tell the principal, tell the teachers, tell your friends.

What you may not do, is take it,
because if you take it long enough, it will hurt your mental health.

This is why people are pushed into doing drugs,
they are medicating the depression they allowed to crush them.

Bottom line is, don’t let anybody hurt you,
you hear?

If you think nobody cares,
I care.

If somebody is hurting you,
they are neither friend nor family.

Your mind is the most important thing in your world,
if it unravels so will everything else.

The brilliance of your mind, also gives the universes light,
the universe becomes a darker place when a mind is hurt.

You must protect your mind at all cost,
move away from the toxic, do not let it poison you, do not let it fracture you.

You are to triumph over all your troubles,
don’t let the bullies make you like they are.

I am going to try to show you how narrated books at the library,
can help.

But first I must explain how powerful they are,
so that you don’t throw the idea away thinking it is useless.

As you can imagine Human Beings come with some massive adaptations,
mostly setup by evolution and some useful random quirks that end up making us Great Survivors and Warriors.

The most powerful pain,
also triggers our ability to super-rapidly inherit wisdom.

Psychological pain of any kind,
helps us penetrate complex mental models such as philosophies.

The more ache, the smarter we get,
and the faster wisdom will remove it.

Schools, TV, dumb friends, and stupid people,
have stolen the word books from us.

Liars and manipulators stole narrated books,
by making us feel shame for listening.

Even though we don’t need that word,
as we only need to talk about the Wise Storytellers.

We are not going to let them steal anything,
a book is the soul of the author, it is a sacred gift.

Each book is unique,
no two stories are the same.

Books cannot be generalized,
the fact that it is text on paper or digitized speech has nothing to do with the content.

You should never let anyone push you away from books,
because that is the same as pushing you away from people into some darkness.

Stand up for books whenever you can,
it is the only reliable way to inherit wisdom.

---

I want to say “Find Biographies” as that represents real wisdom of real people,
but a good biography is actually a Story of Amazing Adventure.

---

And please go for the narrated books first,
sitting over a book and reading the actual words, is the worst way to get at the adventure.

Listening to the story, or to the actual author that wrote book if you are lucky,
makes an enormous difference.

There are many ways to read a sentence,
and the author is the safest bet, to get it right.

I found that Wikipedia has a tiny [Audiobook awards][1] category, listing [Audie Award][2], [British Book Awards][3], [Odyssey Awards][4], and the [Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album][5], looking through the provided winner listings is a wonderful way to find your next narrated book.

In closing I would like to caution you,
narrated books not only relive pain, but also make us intellectually independent and unique.

The more stories of Adventure, Biographies, Philosophies, the more depth to your tears,
the more rage to your word, and the greater the desire to yell out wisdom at street corners.

The books will help you understand that there is plenty to worry about,
but they will also show you that it is of no use to be crushed by dark imaginings, or forget that Socrates advises that we should be of good cheer.

Books will make you blindingly brilliant, and the intellectual part of that is the least of it,
you will actually give off blinding light to all those that are on the same path as you.

And you will learn things that you may wish you didn't know, I was just reading Bill Bryson's Made In America,
and not only did I learn that "Pants" is hardly a real word, as it is actually a contraction of the word Pantaloons,
which presumably we should use instead, to be proper.

But also, that it wasn't until 1908 that the word panties stated referring to ladies' underpants,
it is safe to say that until 1908 grizzly cowboys would have conversations that would go like this:

'Ey Cle(D)us, you (/a)nd Cornelius keep h(/a)din on north,
'm goin' to stop by Jeb'di(/a)h's and git some fresh p(/a)nties, cause the ones I've been ridi'n in don't wash no more, and st(/a)r(D)ed spookin' my 'orse.

is a wonderful way to find your next narrated book.\nIn closing I would like to caution you,\nnarrated books not only relive pain, but also make us intellectually independent and unique.\nThe more stories of Adventure, Biographies, Philosophies, the more depth to your tears,\nthe more rage to your word, and the greater the desire to yell out wisdom at street corners.\nThe books will help you understand that there is plenty to worry about,\nbut they will also show you that it is of no use to be crushed by dark imaginings, or forget that Socrates advises that we should be of good cheer.\nBooks will make you blindingly brilliant, and the intellectual part of that is the least of it,\nyou will actually give off blinding light to all those that are on the same path as you.\nAnd you will learn things that you may wish you didn't know, I was just reading Bill Bryson's Made In America,\nand not only did I learn that \"Pants\" is hardly a real word, as it is actually a contraction of the word Pantaloons,\nwhich presumably we should use instead, to be proper.\nBut also, that it wasn't until 1908 that the word panties stated referring to ladies' underpants,\nit is safe to say that until 1908 grizzly cowboys would have conversations that would go like this:\n'Ey Cle(D)us, you (/a)nd Cornelius keep h(/a)din on north,\n'm goin' to stop by Jeb'di(/a)h's and git some fresh p(/a)nties, cause the ones I've been ridi'n in don't wash no more, and st(/a)r(D)ed spookin' my 'orse.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Audiobook_awards\n[2]:

  "text": "First of all, Linux is not an Operating System,\nit is a central component of an operating system, refereed to as Kernel.\nHowever once it is paired with commands,\nwhich allow us to operate the system the two are installed on, we can then call the pair a Linux Kernel based Operating System.\nAnd if the commands come from the GNU project,\nthen we can call it GNU/Linux.\nOften when people say Linux, they mean,\nthat other class of operating systems that isn't Windows or Apple - which is wrong, but I think is perfectly fine.\nJust using the word Linux is ambiguous, but OK-ish,\npeople just rely on context to figure it out.\nWhen someone says I have installed Linux on all my computers they mean the operating system,\nbecause you can't install the Kernel, you use it to craft a brand new new Operating System.\nWhen someone says I am compiling Linux right now,\nthen they mean the Kernel, they are probably upgrading their Operating System Kernel to the latest version.\nKernel is shipped as source code, it contains code needed to talk to the computer hardware,\ncompiling is what you do with it.\nWhen someone says GNU Linux, then they are being all classy and proper,\nand are referring to the GNU Operating System that had its own Kernel swapped out with the Linux Kernel.\nThe GNU Kernel is named Hurd and and it is not as good as the Linux Kernel,\nthe GNU Operating System is so powerful that it can either use the Hurd Kernel or Linux Kernel.\nYou don't hear about the GNU Operating System very often,\nbecause it it is usually something that Operating System creators build on, and their creations get their own names.\nThe GNU Operating System is often used as a base Operating System,\nthat has more stuff piled on top of it, and only then does it get a name.\nI am currently writing this on [Fedora][],\naccording to Wikipedia the original programmer that created Linux Kernel Linus Torvalds[1] also uses Fedora.\nAnd there are many others,\nUbuntu, Linux Mint, SUSE, Arch Linux.\nThey are all Linux and most of them use GNU operating system components,\nGNU is free, and good quality.\nBut yes, there are Linux operating systems that are Linux but try to avoid GNU,\nAndroid is one of them, and then TV and close hardware things may get rid of GNU on legal basis as they don't approve of the GNU license.\n\nAllow me to mention a couple of side notes here before we carry on,\nall my computer programs are under the GNU license, I probably wrote almost a thousand programs by now.\nIt is not a big number, and most of it has been lost to broken hard rives, dying laptops, cheap floppies,\nit was all written for the purpose of self education, I have about 200 programs on the internet now, and they are all GNU licensed.\nI also wanted to explain what compilation is, it is what you to do convert human readable source code in a programming language designed for programmers,\nto codes that are executable by CPU, by the computer hardware.\n\nComputer hardware talks in an optimized language that is very hard to read by humans,\nso programmers invented high level-programming languages that are somewhat english-ish to help themselves read code better.\nThe machine language is so hard to read that when crackers try to remove copy protection from programs that require purchase and registration,\nthey wouldn't dream of trying to understand all the machine code, they just try to find the first good place to short circuit the serial number check - and get the heck outa there.\nIt is cruel and unusual to read the machine code, some coders do it when source code is lost and only quick fixes are needed,\nand artist write programs in machine code from scratch, but they don't write very big programs, just very artistic machine code.\nAnd in the past, programmers used to look down on people that used high level more readable programming languages,\nas they would often overlook something that the human mind could strategist about optimize really well, but computers got faster, and only high speed Wall Street traders, and graphic card manufactures worry about that now.\nPersonally, I go even higher than that,\nI write in a language that does not ask me to specify the type of memory I need, which as you can imagine many programmers consider wasteful.\nIt is absolutely the same argument that was had back when coders wrote machine code,\nstrangely enough Microsoft added a kind of memory type information back to a variant of my language, which defeats the purpose of an un-typed language, they

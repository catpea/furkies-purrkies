    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">First of all, Linux is not an Operating System,<br>it is a central component of an operating system, refereed to as Kernel.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">However once it is paired with commands,<br>which allow us to operate the system the two are installed on, we can then call the pair a Linux Kernel based Operating System.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And if the commands come from the GNU project,<br>then we can call it GNU/Linux.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Often when people say Linux, they mean,<br>that other class of operating systems that isn't Windows or Apple - which is wrong, but I think is perfectly fine.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just using the word Linux is ambiguous, but OK-ish,<br>people just rely on context to figure it out.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When someone says I have installed Linux on all my computers they mean the operating system,<br>because you can't install the Kernel, you use it to craft a brand new new Operating System.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When someone says I am compiling Linux right now,<br>then they mean the Kernel, they are probably upgrading their Operating System Kernel to the latest version.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Kernel is shipped as source code, it contains code needed to talk to the computer hardware,<br>compiling is what you do with it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When someone says GNU Linux, then they are being all classy and proper,<br>and are referring to the GNU Operating System that had its own Kernel swapped out with the Linux Kernel.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The GNU Kernel is named Hurd and and it is not as good as the Linux Kernel,<br>the GNU Operating System is so powerful that it can either use the Hurd Kernel or Linux Kernel.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You don't hear about the GNU Operating System very often,<br>because it it is usually something that Operating System creators build on, and their creations get their own names.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The GNU Operating System is often used as a base Operating System,<br>that has more stuff piled on top of it, and only then does it get a name.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I am currently writing this on [Fedora][],<br>according to Wikipedia the original programmer that created Linux Kernel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE">Linus Torvalds</a> also uses Fedora.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And there are many others,<br>Ubuntu, Linux Mint, SUSE, Arch Linux.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They are all Linux and most of them use GNU operating system components,<br>GNU is free, and good quality.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But yes, there are Linux operating systems that are Linux but try to avoid GNU,<br>Android is one of them, and then TV and close hardware things may get rid of GNU on legal basis as they don't approve of the GNU license.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Allow me to mention a couple of side notes here before we carry on,<br>all my computer programs are under the GNU license, I probably wrote almost a thousand programs by now.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not a big number, and most of it has been lost to broken hard rives, dying laptops, cheap floppies,<br>it was all written for the purpose of self education, I have about 200 programs on the internet now, and they are all GNU licensed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I also wanted to explain what compilation is, it is what you to do convert human readable source code in a programming language designed for programmers,<br>to codes that are executable by CPU, by the computer hardware.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Computer hardware talks in an optimized language that is very hard to read by humans,<br>so programmers invented high level-programming languages that are somewhat english-ish to help themselves read code better.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The machine language is so hard to read that when crackers try to remove copy protection from programs that require purchase and registration,<br>they wouldn't dream of trying to understand all the machine code, they just try to find the first good place to short circuit the serial number check - and get the heck outa there.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is cruel and unusual to read the machine code, some coders do it when source code is lost and only quick fixes are needed,<br>and artist write programs in machine code from scratch, but they don't write very big programs, just very artistic machine code.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And in the past, programmers used to look down on people that used high level more readable programming languages,<br>as they would often overlook something that the human mind could strategist about optimize really well, but computers got faster, and only high speed Wall Street traders, and graphic card manufactures worry about that now.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Personally, I go even higher than that,<br>I write in a language that does not ask me to specify the type of memory I need, which as you can imagine many programmers consider wasteful.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is absolutely the same argument that was had back when coders wrote machine code,<br>strangely enough Microsoft added a kind of memory type information back to a variant of my language, which defeats the purpose of an un-typed language, they created a language by moving backwards.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This should never be an issue, no one should track you,<br>or tell you how to turn on your computer, you shouldn't be considered a product that represents money.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You should try to stay away from businesses that are trying to pinch your pennies to make money from you,<br>they do not want to give you anything of value, businesses just want to take the maximum that they can get way with.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But The GNU operating system is so flexible,<br>that people replaced its Hurd Kernel with Linux Kernel which is further along than Hurd.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Combining the two together you get the GNU/Linux,<br>but that is still pretty bare bones, and here people add even more stuff which is what Ubuntu, Linux Mint, SUSE, Arch Linux, etc.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And here finally, if you are wondering how to get an open Linux based Operating System going,<br>I recommend, a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry PI</a> based computer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The $150 8GB "<a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-complete-starter-kit.html">Raspberry Pi 4 Complete Starter Kit</a>" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=raspberry+pi+4+canakit+assembly">needs a tiny bit of assembly but there are videos showing you how to do it</a>,<br>and there is also the 4GB (which is OK) $100 fully assembled "<a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-400-desktop-computer-kit.html">Raspberry Pi 400 Computer Kit</a>" that looks like a keyboard.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Other than that just search the internet for "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Linux+Laptop+Review">Linux Laptop</a>",<br>I have a cheap Walmart laptop that I installed Fedora on and everything works perfectly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think the most outrageous Linux computer is the <a href="https://puri.sm/">Librem Phone</a> priced at $2,000,<br>the opposite is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=PinePhone+Review">PinePhone</a> at just about $150,</div>

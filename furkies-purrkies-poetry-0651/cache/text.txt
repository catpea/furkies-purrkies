This here is a ballad,
about the invention of a new kind of salad.
My invention begun with rediscovery of fruit,
that it makes any vegetable taste good.
After many years of research and relaxation,
I hereby list the ingredients in celebration.

The most important of them all is the Raspberry Fruit spread,
enough said.
The fruit spread enriches two things,
thus giving the salad wings.
First, it makes all vegetables taste like fruit,
seriously even picky kids will think they taste good.
And Second - and you have to give it a try,
it prevents the much needed Jalapeño (gatito grande habla español), from making you cry.
Just sure your Jalapeño is not too hot,
and I promise you will like it a lot.

The Jalapeño can be pickled or freshly picked,
the rules of my salad are not very strict.
Likewise the vegetables can be fresh or frozen,
so as long as you make sure there is about a dozen.

You have to lay it all out on a bed,
made out of shredded lettuce, sunflower seeds, and a bit of bread.

That vegetables turn to fruit when they touch a sweet raspberry or strawberry,
is my favorite discovery.
I’ve thus created Jalapeñoberry,
where depending on spiciness results may wary.
Sweet Pepperberries were very nice,
and I had many a slice.
I had Cornberries,
which reminded me of cranberries.
Though my carrots were a bit old,
the Carrotberries were pure gold.
I even tasted a baked Potatoberry,
and the taste was nice and very airy.
The Squashberry was especially neat,
as the Jalapeño gave it a bit of heat.
And I actually enjoyed a huge Broccoliberry,
which used to be my vegetable adversary.
And when I added the fruit spread to a strawberry,
I think, I might have invented a berryberry.

I am sure that whatever new fruits you create,
will taste just great.
Good times is what’s all about,
I hope you will soon the salad to try it out.

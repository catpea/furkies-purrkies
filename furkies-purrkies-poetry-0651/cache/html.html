  <p>This here is a ballad,<br>about the invention of a new kind of salad.</p>
  <p>My invention begun with rediscovery of fruit,<br>that it makes any vegetable taste good.</p>
  <p>After many years of research and relaxation,<br>I hereby list the ingredients in celebration.</p>

  <p>The most important of them all is the Raspberry Fruit spread,<br>enough said.</p>
  <p>The fruit spread enriches two things,<br>thus giving the salad wings.</p>
  <p>First, it makes all vegetables taste like fruit,<br>seriously even picky kids will think they taste good.</p>
  <p>And Second - and you have to give it a try,<br>it prevents the much needed Jalapeño (gatito grande habla español), from making you cry.</p>
  <p>Just sure your Jalapeño is not too hot,<br>and I promise you will like it a lot.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>The Jalapeño can be pickled or freshly picked,<br>the rules of my salad are not very strict.</p>
  <p>Likewise the vegetables can be fresh or frozen,<br>so as long as you make sure there is about a dozen.</p>

  <p>You have to lay it all out on a bed,<br>made out of shredded lettuce, sunflower seeds, and a bit of bread.</p>

  <p>That vegetables turn to fruit when they touch a sweet raspberry or strawberry,<br>is my favorite discovery.</p>
  <p>I’ve thus created Jalapeñoberry,<br>where depending on spiciness results may wary.</p>
  <p>Sweet Pepperberries were very nice,<br>and I had many a slice.</p>
  <p>I had Cornberries,<br>which reminded me of cranberries.</p>
  <p>Though my carrots were a bit old,<br>the Carrotberries were pure gold.</p>
  <p>I even tasted a baked Potatoberry,<br>and the taste was nice and very airy.</p>
  <p>The Squashberry was especially neat,<br>as the Jalapeño gave it a bit of heat.</p>
  <p>And I actually enjoyed a huge Broccoliberry,<br>which used to be my vegetable adversary.</p>
  <p>And when I added the fruit spread to a strawberry,<br>I think, I might have invented a berryberry.</p>

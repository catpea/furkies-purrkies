Life shouldn't be about beating your best,
just as important as rising, is your day of rest.

No matter how important your athletic quest,
or how upon your arrival you are going to be blessed.

Everyone, needs to get some rest,
days will only get longer when you are stressed.

If you must,
imagine you are a Bird of Fantastic Plumage, and your bed is a nest.

Come morning, fling up your messy crest,
and puff up your chest.

And tweet, about how you are not getting dressed,
because you are too stressed, and you are having your rest.

And explain to those confused, that you are not speaking in jest,
make it clear that this is not, a test.

Today is your day of rest,
at best, you will be having a nice cup of tea, should you feel pressed.

Allow strength to return to you, so that you are at your best,
tomorrow, or in few days, you'll resume your quest.

Once you are not feeling so stressed,
you'll show the world that You are the Best.

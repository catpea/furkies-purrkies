  <p>I have first learned of Trail Magic from Bill Bryson,<br>in his book entitled <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/A-Walk-in-the-Woods-Audiobook/B0091J9AQQ">A Walk In The Woods</a>, which later became a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOF2LIAp9bw">Movie</a> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lm_aiG381c">Robert Redford and Nick Nolte</a></p>
  <p>I used to adventure over at <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hmnf/recarea/?recid=18770">Nordhouse Dunes</a> in Michigan,<br>It is a Wilderness, and it is unwise to think of it as small.</p>
  <p>It costs $15 per week, for the car permit,<br>there are water pumps here and there, though once I saw a couple filtering Lake Michigan water.</p>
  <p>The camp sites are by an ancient dune,<br>where you get to fall asleep, to the endless horizon of the great Lake Michigan.</p>
  <p>Plus, you are facing west,<br>which means every evening closes with a Beautiful Sunset.</p>

  <p>There are some more pricey less rustic camp sites in the area,<br>and I remember reading a warning about Bears!</p>
  <p>It is real Wilderness, but the Bears are gentle,<br>and any rustling you will hear in the middle of the night will be the wind, and nothing more.</p>
  <p>The most dangerous things out there will be your knife,<br>and the occasional thunderstorm which you can often watch headed your way over the Lake.</p>
  <p>The place comes to life after a Rainfall,<br>and the woods smell so nice, a mix of Pine Cones and Perfect Nature.</p>
  <p>There are no raccoons, and mosquitoes won't bother you,<br>if you bring a repellent.</p>

  <p>One time, on my way back to my camp site,<br>probably from an expedition to get an ice cream bar.</p>
  <p>I ran into three young hikers a Lady and Two of Her Brothers that were gathering up wood,<br>and <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3VLFDc8hNTeMRbpRA">setting up camp two thirds of the way to the lake</a>.</p>
  <p>I asked what happened, and they said the lake was just too far for them,<br>and they decided to camp here.</p>
  <p>I told them that the beach was just around the corner, which was about 2,000 ft,<br>and passionately offered to help them carry their stuff.</p>
  <p>They didn't set up their tens yet, so they quickly rolled up whatever they had out<br>I grabbed all the heavy stuff and we started walking to the beach.</p>

  <p>I immediately begun explaining that I've learned of Trail Magic from Bill Bryson,<br>and I defined it as, someone helping, without wanting anything in return.</p>
  <p>I went on talking about Nordhouse, and what it is like out there,<br>I talked about the dunes, and greatly emphasized that there is a Beach out there.</p>
  <p>I mentioned that we were on the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/S5NN4kUYn4sEmQgu9">Nurnberg End Of Trail</a> which is the harder way,<br>with <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/onCa4264ioU9euKq5">West Forest Trail End</a> being somewhat easier.</p>
  <p>We arrived in no time, and I encouraged them to camp the night in the sandy dunes,<br>as it was absolutely the most beautiful spot there.</p>
  <p>They actually found an even more beautiful place,<br>by climbing up a near by dune, I am certain they had a great time.</p>

  <p>Just as soon as they had their spot,<br>I waived goodbye, and <em>very</em> quickly hurried away to my own world and distant camp site.</p>
  <p>I did not want to give an impression that I expected a Thank You, or any such thing,<br>Trail Magic is just magic, no explanation, no thank you.</p>
  <p>Somehow I just know,<br>they didn't have a hard time getting back to their car.</p>
  <p>They originally gave up on making to the beach because it was late evening,<br>and they didn't know if they could make it before dark.</p>
  <p>Helping is just what we do, and it is not a big deal,<br>but I am very proud that I told them about Bill Bryson, <a href="https://www.audible.com/blog/playlisted/article-best-travel-audiobooks">Narrated Adventure Books</a>, and Trail Magic.</p>

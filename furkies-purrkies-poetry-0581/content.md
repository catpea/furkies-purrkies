We have to find a way,
to invent every day.

Do not fear,
invents something beautiful and real.

Maybe a costume for Halloween, or Christmas, or even Veterans Day,
who can say.

You must ask yourself,
if you are the elf or the shelf.

If you never sung _before_ then,
then today you should open that door.

Singing is an art,
if you don't know where to start...

Maybe you need to write a song,
it need not be very long.

---

It maybe embarrassing a bit,
but will your elder self regret it?

You will not,
and I am sure your friends will like it a lot.

And if your songs are as bad as mine,
then that is a sign.

Life is calling you to get good at it,
and create a huge hit.

Or just take whatever it is you sing,
and create an amazing alarm or phone ring.

---

Don't feel embarrassed to sing, or paint, or dance,
you should always take a creative chance.

Everything you create is a beautiful treasure,
and one of a kind and beyond all measure.

If you don't give up on the beautiful things you do,
you'll make people smile, and they'll love you.

---

In case it has been a while since you created art,
and aren't too sure where to start.

Well first of all, you may need a day of rest,
as that is surely when you are at your mightiest?

And then just start somewhere you like,
or go camping, or on a long hike.

And if your talents are rusty,
or the equipment is too dusty....

Then find something new to do,
without any further adu.

One year doing this, one year doing that,
and a new talent can be had.

I would recommend - if you don't mind,
get a canvas and use a projector to get a portrait outlined.

And then use snail mail to get it sent,
to your friend.

And they'll be like "No way!",
and that will surely make for a nice day.

Though I think my favorite recommendation,
is creating a tiny little poem with good narration.

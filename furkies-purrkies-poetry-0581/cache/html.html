  <p>We have to find a way,<br>to invent every day.</p>
  <p>Do not fear,<br>invents something beautiful and real.</p>
  <p>Maybe a costume for Halloween, or Christmas, or even Veterans Day,<br>who can say.</p>
  <p>You must ask yourself,<br>if you are the elf or the shelf.</p>

  <p>If you never sung <em>before</em> then,<br>then today you should open that door.</p>
  <p>Singing is an art,<br>if you don't know where to start...</p>
  <p>Maybe you need to write a song,<br>it need not be very long.</p>

  <p>It maybe embarrassing a bit,<br>but will your elder self regret it?</p>
  <p>You will not,<br>and I am sure your friends will like it a lot.</p>
  <p>And if your songs are as bad as mine,<br>then that is a sign.</p>
  <p>Life is calling you to get good at it,<br>and create a huge hit.</p>
  <p>Or just take whatever it is you sing,<br>and create an amazing alarm or phone ring.</p>

  <p>Don't feel embarrassed to sing, or paint, or dance,<br>you should always take a creative chance.</p>
  <p>Everything you create is a beautiful treasure,<br>and one of a kind and beyond all measure.</p>
  <p>If you don't give up on the beautiful things you do,<br>you'll make people smile, and they'll love you.</p>

  <p>In case it has been a while since you created art,<br>and aren't too sure where to start.</p>
  <p>Well first of all, you may need a day of rest,<br>as that is surely when you are at your mightiest?</p>
  <p>And then just start somewhere you like,<br>or go camping, or on a long hike.</p>
  <p>And if your talents are rusty,<br>or the equipment is too dusty....</p>
  <p>Then find something new to do,<br>without any further adu.</p>
  <p>One year doing this, one year doing that,<br>and a new talent can be had.</p>

  <p>I would recommend - if you don't mind,<br>get a canvas and use a projector to get a portrait outlined.</p>
  <p>And then use snail mail to get it sent,<br>to your friend.</p>
  <p>And they'll be like "No way!",<br>and that will surely make for a nice day.</p>
  <p>Though I think my favorite recommendation,<br>is creating a tiny little poem with good narration.</p>

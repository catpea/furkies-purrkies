  <p>Yes, the paintings are kind of incomplete,<br>but not the kind where portraits are distorted.</p>
  <p>The incompleteness of impressionism,<br>is found in areas like the corner of the eye.</p>
  <p>It usually takes three minutes to sort things out in there,<br>but with Impressionism it is a simple swipe of the correct color.</p>

  <p>Now the crazy thing is,<br>that...</p>
  <p>Considering the viewers state of mind,<br>where they normally look at the painting...</p>
  <p>They are not interested in a correctly painted,<br>corner of the eye.</p>

  <p>I see Impressionism as a magical compression algorithm,<br>for oil paintings.</p>
  <p>The magic, is that photo-realism is not necessary,<br>to paint a person without distortions.</p>
  <p>Crazy, incomplete, rough, hurried brushwork,<br>does not actually distort the person in the painting.</p>

  <p>I suspect color issues may be overlooked,<br>I was just working on a painting where colors conspired to create a neat illusion.</p>
  <p>This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion">Checker Shadow Illusion</a>,<br>and illusions can make a painting difficult.</p>
  <p>A big part of why impressionism is so neat, is speed of painting,<br>there is definitely no room for fighting illusion here.</p>

  <p>To give you a more popular example of how terribly misleading illusions can be,<br>the moon never changes size.</p>
  <p>When we see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_illusion">huge moon at the horizon</a>,<br>that is an illusion.</p>
  <p>I remember an astrophysicist saying,<br>grab your ankles and look at the moon upside-down it will look small again.</p>

  <p>Out of respect for Impressionism,<br>we can't stop for the Checker Shadow Illusion.</p>
  <p>This is where digital painting,<br>makes Impressionism even more powerful.</p>
  <p>We just use the color picker,<br>and a reference image stretched over the entire canvas.</p>

  <p>Like the the reference over canvas technique, and Hyperrealism,<br>Impressionism is an incredible teacher.</p>
  <p>In the time span of one hyperrealistic work,<br>you can make five or more impressionist ones, and thus explore all the steps beyond.</p>
  <p>Impressionism brings everything closer to you,<br>from composition and multi-person paintings to a powerful Impressionist portfolio and your first art show.</p>

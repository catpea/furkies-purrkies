  <p>It is 95% of a digital painting,<br>it is a major part of fast painting technique.</p>
  <p>The word value in art,<br>means the darkness or brightness of a color.</p>
  <p>So shadow and light,<br>It is a study of shadows, mid-tones, light, and highlights.</p>

  <p>Someone chose the world value,<br>because it is short.</p>
  <p>And then it caught on,<br>because it makes an artist sound like a pro.</p>
  <p>“Hey, bro, I got to park my car in the low values,<br>so that the glue in my custom trim work doesn’t turn to gooooo” - true story.</p>

  <p>So, you start by painting a black and white version of your color photo,<br>which when you think about...</p>
  <p>It is much-much simpler and crazy-quicker<br>than when painting with a full color palette.</p>
  <p>And then, as you add rough colors,<br>generic green for grass, fancy aquamarine for ocean.</p>
  <p>The computer will ignore the value in the color you picked,<br>and instead use the value from your value study.</p>
  <p>So you are laying down the right color,<br>and the computer ensures it is the right darkness...</p>
  <p>The shadows, mid-tones, light, and highlights,<br>that you already configured, and you know that they work.</p>

  <p>In the old way of painting,<br>a value study is about finding the darkest spots in your paining.</p>
  <p>Pencils and charcoal,<br>were just perfect for it.</p>
  <p>Basically you throw the color away,<br>and focus on the shadows first.</p>
  <p>The Old Masters would create brown under-paintings,<br>that sometimes needed little more than a glaze of color.</p>

  <p>Once you have your black and white painting,<br>you add a new layer and set layer mode to color.</p>
  <p>All graphic programs,<br>have that feature.</p>
  <p>And in this layer mode, your program will substitute value in the all the colors on this layer,<br>with values from all the layers combined, beneath it.</p>
  <p>Let me restate that, all the colors on the color layer will have theri value removed,<br>and then the value from all the layers beneath will be used.</p>

  <p>It this simple and rapid painting technique,<br>it pretty much does not make sense to have any color beneath your COLOR MORE layer.</p>
  <p>What you want is black, grays and white information,<br>because that is what that technique is about.</p>
  <p>And one interesting way to test all this,<br>is to grab a black and white photo, or even a picture of an ancient greek sculpture.</p>
  <p>Make sure to de-saturated it,<br>even though it maybe black and white already.</p>
  <p>And then add a new layer on top,<br>set the mode to Color.</p>
  <p>And then use a flesh tone color, or pick one from a color photo,<br>and gently spray it on the color layer.</p>
  <p>So as long as it is a flesh tone it does not matter if the color seems too dark or too bright,<br>because that information will come from the black and white photo or sculpture beneath.</p>

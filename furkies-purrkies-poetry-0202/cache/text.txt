Once and for all, learn to see Your Life as a Whole,
You only get one life, and that whole life is your life.

The whole thing is yours,
but you also have to become,
Great Beings, Mountain Movers, and Mentors.

The little ones need it,
you have to teach them the height you rose to,
so that they may continue,
and not reset back to where you started,
where it all started.

Governments, Laws, Institutions,
Schools Universities and Constitutions,
are Nothing compared to Your Heart, Your Wisdom.

Without Heart and Wisdom, all the machines we created out of paper and paper clips,
and bureaucrats, and democrats, an all the lying rats,
it all turns against us, and we are sent back a hundred years.

Back to war, concentration camps, bullet riddled buildings.

By the powers of Universe we have access to all the future we want,
but to advance forward we must teach, because lessons lost,
come at a great cost, a cost to the little ones,
your daughters and your sons.

To Teach, we must become Wise,
to become wise we must Learn,
not merely age as if we are living in a cage,
you are free to grow.

Grow to see it all,
so that you may know gateway from a wall,
so that the children may stand on the shoulders of giants,
so that their future is that much closer.

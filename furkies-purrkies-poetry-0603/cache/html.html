  <p>Add it all up together,<br>and try to make it better.</p>
  <p>Because history moves pretty fast,<br>soon all this will become a distant past.</p>

  <p>The future will see us forgetting-lessons between generations,<br>and fighting wars across stupid borders of poor nations.</p>
  <p>That's why we have to look far,<br>sometimes even see the sun as a lonely star.</p>
  <p>See the little human race,<br>as capable of dreaming through time and space.</p>

  <p>History has no time to see the sides,<br>it barely even notes our great divides.</p>
  <p>The wars are just a mistake,<br>born from the divisions we make.</p>
  <p>But our daydreams are in deed awesome,<br>and we must take care to help them to blossom.</p>
  <p>There is no limit to length of dreams,<br>and we should connect them in long streams.</p>

  <p>I think when we dream to connect things together,<br>our future slowly becomes better.</p>
  <p>And there is no imagining how beautiful it can look,<br>until we start inheriting from book after book.</p>
  <p>This way we can learn lessons from the past,<br>and make the advancements-made last.</p>

  <p>Dreams and books are just the first part,<br>as then we have to write down our art.</p>
  <p>We have to pass on our lessons in some simple way,<br>as we all need to have our say.</p>
  <p>And we have to pass on the lessons we find in the past,<br>ensuring that those too will last.</p>

  <p>The direction is always more wisdom and cheer,<br>converge on all that is precious and dear.</p>
  <p>Abandon all the bad ideas to the past,<br>and move forward fast.</p>
  <p>We are not at a point in history when we can rest,<br>humanity advancing forward is for the best.</p>

  <p>To make sure that someone in the future takes a look,<br>put only your best ideas and into a simple book.</p>
  <p>And when you find it too hard to fill a page,<br>then you need more books to reach the next stage.</p>
  <p>Unlike an imaginary memorization test in school,<br>a book can be used as an honest measuring tool.</p>

  <p>Start with dreams, inheritance of wisdom, and writing,<br>and aim to help humanity dream about uniting.</p>
  <p>Completeness of your book helps you test the completeness of your mind,<br>it will help you get all your thoughts aligned.</p>
  <p>Writing is like having Socrates help you with your thoughts,<br>before you know it you'll repair all the trouble spots.</p>

  <p>You should be able to see up and down in time,<br>and all the mountains should be yours to climb.</p>
  <p>And you have to get above things like paying for school,<br>and never let anybody use you as a tool.</p>
  <p>Wisdom is the art of seeing,<br>and you are meant to Become a Great Being.</p>

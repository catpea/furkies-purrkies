  <p>Most of the dictators have fallen,<br>because people, in their wisdom, have learned to fight them, across generations.</p>
  <p>Evil and other stupid ideas,<br>are temporary.</p>

  <p>This is why we are all familiar with the image of the Laughing Philosopher,<br>we pick up on it from myths, stories, books or movies.</p>
  <p>Not only is is an image describing the most powerful being,<br>but an image of a being who has understood, the world is OK, it is just moving at its own pace.</p>
  <p>The people have simply learned that the single most powerful weapon against evil,<br>is the brilliant minds of the younger generations.</p>
  <p>Rather than standing up to evil in war, where evil can only spread,<br>they stand up to evil in time, where it has no power, and it is perpetually weakening.</p>

  <p>Look back at history, how feeble the Burning of Books,<br>the attempts of keeping the Slaves uneducated, or even censoring knowledge filled parts of internet.</p>
  <p>The one amazing thing about human beings, is that we are out thinkers,<br>the way we think is thought by though building up little layers of knowledge.</p>
  <p>And if someone tries to create a wall, people will immediately comprehend it,<br>and start out-thinking it, why a wall, what is is trying to control, who is benefiting from that.</p>
  <p>The battle against evil is invisible to us, the same way it is invisible to the dictators,<br>it is flying over our heads, so that the smallest number of people suffer, as we improve the world with Wisdom across Centuries.</p>

  <p>"What can you do to help?",<br>oh, my goodness, this is my favorite question.</p>
  <p>Everything important that I ever write about,<br>is all about this question.</p>
  <p>It is the Trinity,<br>of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>

  <p>The way you help the world fight its way out of the dark ages,<br>is by constantly inheriting knowledge from the Wise and the Great.</p>
  <p>You just keep reading those books, just keep listening to those narrated books,<br>keep watching the well grounded documentaries, and keep building that brilliant self balancing and self reinforcing lattice of Knowledge in your mind.</p>
  <p>One example of that, is all the people who were once hesitant about vaccines,<br>but became more educated during the pandemic of 2020.</p>

  <p>This interactive self balancing self reinforcing, self healing, lattice of knowledge,<br>also represents a factory of new thoughts, they just bubble up out of there.</p>
  <p>Oh, you can say,<br>"new thoughts come by subtle analogy to what we already know",</p>
  <p>..or you can call it "IDEA SYNTHESIS"<br>to impress your medicine minded friends.</p>
  <p>...but really new ideas come because we are Humans,<br>and all Humans are Indescribably Beautiful and Special and Out Of Control Thinkers; new ideas is what we are good at.</p>
  <p>For example, someone who invents a new form of art,<br>is not a good artist, they are just a person who had an art idea so excellent, that they immediate became a fancy artist.</p>
  <p>These fancy new ideas, when combined and refined with the knowledge that you inherited from other great minds,<br>create Wisdom.</p>
  <p>You can be your own source of wisdom,<br>but by inheriting wisdom from others, you become even wiser.</p>
  <p>Wisdom is not just ideas though,<br>wisdom is about ideas that approach a certain kind of Royalty.</p>
  <p>Here, the non-academic Philosophers, really help us,<br>they speak of ideas that you cannot help but tot love.</p>
  <p>Ideas, so powerful that just love them,<br>ideas so beautiful that the only way we can connect with them or hold them, is with the superpower of Love.</p>

  <p>There exists a class of ideas, that you must grow up to, that you must better yourself towards,<br>that you must challenge yourself to rise to.</p>
  <p>And that is what Real Philosophy is about,<br>the words <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">Φιλο Σοφία</a> come from greek and mean Love of Wisdom.</p>
  <p>Amor Fati, for example, is something that we must grow up to to understand,<br>our lattice of knowledge must be sufficiently evolved and refined to grasp the idea openly and freely.</p>
  <p>The Love of Fate is a thing you see from your golden age, when looking back at your life,<br>and the Love in Love Of Fate is rooted not in what happened to you, but what you did with it.</p>
  <p>To give an example from my own life, by the time eight or maybe twelve bullies came after me, and spat and kicked,<br>I have already refined the winning of the battle; by placing the palms of my hands on the concrete and pushing up, to rise, even if it meant I would fall again.</p>
  <p>The fights were not won, by becoming one of the snarling beasts, they were all won after they all left,<br>in not becoming like they were, in not behaving like the monsters.</p>
  <p>I was not smart enough to comprehend my bullies, I still don't understand, and simply don't think about it,<br>but what I do think about is my rising.</p>
  <p>How I invented a way to win every battle by not fighting them, at all, by not becoming stained with violence or anger,<br>to this day, I have never been angry.</p>
  <p>But, I know anger, I saw it in the <em>angry</em> red faces of my bullies,<br>the older I get the more I worry that their families hurt them just out of laziness, out of wanting to do nothing, or wanting to have nothing to do with them.</p>
  <p>This is why it is important for us to hold some ides in greatest esteem,<br>to remind the worst of us, that there are far greater things out there, then what we find at home or in our neighborhood, or culture.</p>
  <p>And this is how Love of Fate,<br>can become an Idea that is held with Love.</p>
  <p>Because it is an idea that singles out how we rose,<br>hardships will happen to all, but we cannot stay down.</p>
  <p>More than rising over hardships,<br>we should just remind each other to rise in all things, rise and transcend, as a fact of life.</p>
  <p>Amor Fati, is one small idea, first to be understood from our Golden Age,<br>but not just once we have lived out lives already, but also by connecting with our elder-selves when we are still young, by venturing into our future in day dreams.</p>
  <p>By using our elder selves to become stronger in our youth, and thus reinforcing our elder selved with greater power even,<br>and so on, until we actually arrive into our golden age.</p>
  <p>Come our final days, proclaiming <em>hopefully</em> in <strong>real</strong> anger,<br>"For all the horrible things I have been thorough, I gave it all a reason by learning and rising from it all."</p>
  <p>The beloved ideas, are spoken of from within our bellies, Amor Fati is about rising, and the inspiration from a life lived,<br>but again, your lattice has to be great enough, not to need an explanation, for the feeling of triumph over misery, triumph over what things may come in life.</p>
  <p>And here we rive at the third component; the wisdom and deeds that outlive a person,<br>Greatness is found, in their legacy, and the persistence of their hard won wisdom.</p>
  <p>This is that Rebirth, and that Heaven,<br>that the Fairy Tales describe.</p>
  <p>It is not us, that lives forever,<br>it is the wisdom we share.</p>
  <p>And the heaven that these thoughts take to,<br>is found in the minds of the future generations, that become better for it.</p>
  <p>The wielders of that brilliant lattice,<br>are the real creators, fueled by the past generations, contributing new ideas and refining the old ones.</p>
  <p>It is all for the betterment of us,<br>and every wisdom counts.</p>
  <p>Greatness, is not for the few,<br>it is meant for all, including you.</p>

  <p>Thus, the short answer to how <strong>you</strong> can help the world, is:<br><strong>By Becoming A Great Being</strong>, and you become a Great Being by relentlessly giving everything in you path no matter what things may come: a Greater Meaning.</p>
  <p>You, and all the other Beings,<br>aiming for greatness, is a path to Justice, Peace, and Freedom;</p>
  <p>A World,<br>of Great Beings.</p>

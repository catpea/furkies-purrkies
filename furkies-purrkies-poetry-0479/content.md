Most of the dictators have fallen,
because people, in their wisdom, have learned to fight them, across generations.

Evil and other stupid ideas,
are temporary.

---

This is why we are all familiar with the image of the Laughing Philosopher,
we pick up on it from myths, stories, books or movies.

Not only is is an image describing the most powerful being,
but an image of a being who has understood, the world is OK, it is just moving at its own pace.

The people have simply learned that the single most powerful weapon against evil,
is the brilliant minds of the younger generations.

Rather than standing up to evil in war, where evil can only spread,
they stand up to evil in time, where it has no power, and it is perpetually weakening.

---

Look back at history, how feeble the Burning of Books,
the attempts of keeping the Slaves uneducated, or even censoring knowledge filled parts of internet.

The one amazing thing about human beings, is that we are out thinkers,
the way we think is thought by though building up little layers of knowledge.

And if someone tries to create a wall, people will immediately comprehend it,
and start out-thinking it, why a wall, what is is trying to control, who is benefiting from that.

The battle against evil is invisible to us, the same way it is invisible to the dictators,
it is flying over our heads, so that the smallest number of people suffer, as we improve the world with Wisdom across Centuries.

"What can you do to help?",
oh, my goodness, this is my favorite question.

Everything important that I ever write about,
is all about this question.

It is the Trinity,
of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.


---

The way you help the world fight its way out of the dark ages,
is by constantly inheriting knowledge from the Wise and the Great.

You just keep reading those books, just keep listening to those narrated books,
keep watching the well grounded documentaries, and keep building that brilliant self balancing and self reinforcing lattice of Knowledge in your mind.

One example of that, is all the people who were once hesitant about vaccines,
but became more educated during the pandemic of 2020.

---

This interactive self balancing self reinforcing, self healing, lattice of knowledge,
also represents a factory of new thoughts, they just bubble up out of there.

Oh, you can say,
"new thoughts come by subtle analogy to what we already know",

..or you can call it "IDEA SYNTHESIS"
to impress your medicine minded friends.

...but really new ideas come because we are Humans,
and all Humans are Indescribably Beautiful and Special and Out Of Control Thinkers; new ideas is what we are good at.

For example, someone who invents a new form of art,
is not a good artist, they are just a person who had an art idea so excellent, that they immediate became a fancy artist.

These fancy new ideas, when combined and refined with the knowledge that you inherited from other great minds,
create Wisdom.

You can be your own source of wisdom,
but by inheriting wisdom from others, you become even wiser.

Wisdom is not just ideas though,
wisdom is about ideas that approach a certain kind of Royalty.

Here, the non-academic Philosophers, really help us,
they speak of ideas that you cannot help but tot love.

Ideas, so powerful that just love them,
ideas so beautiful that the only way we can connect with them or hold them, is with the superpower of Love.

---

There exists a class of ideas, that you must grow up to, that you must better yourself towards,
that you must challenge yourself to rise to.

And that is what Real Philosophy is about,
the words [Φιλο Σοφία] come from greek and mean Love of Wisdom.

Amor Fati, for example, is something that we must grow up to to understand,
our lattice of knowledge must be sufficiently evolved and refined to grasp the idea openly and freely.

The Love of Fate is a thing you see from your golden age, when looking back at your life,
and the Love in Love Of Fate is rooted not in what happened to you, but what you did with it.

To give an example from my own life, by the time eight or maybe twelve bullies came after me, and spat and kicked,
I have already refined the winning of the battle; by placing the palms of my hands on the concrete and pushing up, to rise, even if it meant I would fall again.

The fights were not won, by becoming one of the snarling beasts, they were all won after they all left,
in not becoming like they were, in not behaving like the monsters.

I was not smart enough to comprehend my bullies, I still don't understand, and simply don't think about it,
but what I do think about is my rising.

How I invented a way to win every battle by not fighting them, at all, by not becoming stained with violence or anger,
to this day, I have never been angry.

But, I know anger, I saw it in the _angry_ red faces of my bullies,
the older I get the more I worry that their families hurt them just out of laziness, out of wanting to do nothing, or wanting to have nothing to do with them.

This is why it is important for us to hold some ides in greatest esteem,
to remind the worst of us, that there are far greater things out there, then what we find at home or in our neighborhood, or culture.

And this is how Love of Fate,
can become an Idea that is held with Love.

Because it is an idea that singles out how we rose,
hardships will happen to all, but we cannot stay down.

More than rising over hardships,
we should just remind each other to rise in all things, rise and transcend, as a fact of life.

Amor Fati, is one small idea, first to be understood from our Golden Age,
but not just once we have lived out lives already, but also by connecting with our elder-selves when we are still young, by venturing into our future in day dreams.

By using our elder selves to become stronger in our youth, and thus reinforcing our elder selved with greater power even,
and so on, until we actually arrive into our golden age.

Come our final days, proclaiming _hopefully_ in __real__ anger,
"For all the horrible things I have been thorough, I gave it all a reason by learning and rising from it all."

The beloved ideas, are spoken of from within our bellies, Amor Fati is about rising, and the inspiration from a life lived,
but again, your lattice has to be great enough, not to need an explanation, for the feeling of triumph over misery, triumph over what things may come in life.


And here we rive at the third component; the wisdom and deeds that outlive a person,
Greatness is found, in their legacy, and the persistence of their hard won wisdom.

This is that Rebirth, and that Heaven,
that the Fairy Tales describe.

It is not us, that lives forever,
it is the wisdom we share.

And the heaven that these thoughts take to,
is found in the minds of the future generations, that become better for it.

The wielders of that brilliant lattice,
are the real creators, fueled by the past generations, contributing new ideas and refining the old ones.

It is all for the betterment of us,
and every wisdom counts.

Greatness, is not for the few,
it is meant for all, including you.

---

Thus, the short answer to how __you__ can help the world, is:
**By Becoming A Great Being**, and you become a Great Being by relentlessly giving everything in you path no matter what things may come: a Greater Meaning.

You, and all the other Beings,
aiming for greatness, is a path to Justice, Peace, and Freedom;

A World,
of Great Beings.

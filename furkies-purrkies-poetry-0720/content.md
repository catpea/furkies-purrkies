Once you see that Artistic Realism is within reach,
that it is a system of things not a talent.

You can get together with your schoolmates,
and begin building an Art Academy.

---

Be careful not to charge students up-front tuition,
a real school teaches for free.

Like a business investor,
take a percentage from student's art sales.

I suggest you ask the student to decide,
how much of a cut you should get, allow yearly adjustments.

---

A painting that comes to life,
will keep a museum alive.

Supports galleries,
and all the artistic things that connect to it.

Art Supports artists,
even the famous ones will come to your online classes.

---

Building the Art Academy,
making it tuition free, but taking a percent cut, is important.

But before you get there,
know that you will also need to teach all the classes that enable digital painting.

How to put a Desktop together, how to install Linux and Krita.
and so on.

---

But you will also need to offer, programming Krita extensions classes,
compiling and extending Krita, GIMP, and similar.

And the more art related lectures about Generative Programming,
how to write P5.js, how to program SVG files, and make them reactive.

The future of the Academy is about becoming a complete and real school,
one that has an independent educational curriculum... from the fantasy education of the standardized curriculum.

---

You also have to recognize your limits,
and that you deserve to have a good stress-fee life.

That is why you need help from your friends,
no one should be burdened or forced into things that don't move them.

And realize that there is no future in centralized education,
neither brick and mortar nor a website that can shut down.

---

Your school needs to be distributed the way large computer games are,
and it needs to operate when disconnected from the internet.

Art sells, your Academy, can help people out of poverty,
it must be a reliable program.

The online component should be limited to sales,
here [Dribbble][1] and [Creative Market][2] are good examples of an Art Academy store front.

---

You also need to invent a new class of software,
that will allow for rapid development.

It is an event based system,
where things listen and respond to well-named events, for example "Student Sign-up Form Submission" or "Visit To Home Page"

Event based systems can be represented by graphs,
where a node represents an event and an edge (or connecting line) a connection to one of the events that can be triggered from there.


However leave graphs for last,
because you need to build out a collaborative environment first.

It works very similar to wikipedia,
but articles are the events (or graph nodes).

When the home page of this system opens,
one of the things you will see there is "Visit To Home Page" event.


when you click on that,
you will find English descriptions of what the visit does, and on a side bar what events can be triggered from there.

[The text will be written in BDD's Given When Then syntax][3],
this will allow the students to collaboratively build the Academy inside out, while leaving the actual programming to developers.

Like [MediaWiki][4] use SQL tables,
lean from MediaWiki the technology behind WikiPedia for ideas.

---

Your most difficult challenge is already solved,
overlaying reference images over the drawing canvas.

Serves as both reference for shapes,
and a perfect palette.

This is a simple idea,
that anybody can learn, with minimal practice.

---

Soon your store-front will fill with art,
your crowd-sourcing engine will fill with art requests that your students can fulfill for money, where yo take a percent cut to expand the academy.

Make no mistake your Academy Of Art,
is meant to change the world.

The academy of Art is meant to save students from debt,
and offer real education, that shows real results.

---

People of the world need real education,
one that improves their Knowledge, enhances their wisdom, and ignites their greatness.

This is necessary for Humanity to advance,
beyond broken ideas.

Lack of Universal Income and Tolerance of Poverty,
or destroying food so that the hungry can't eat it and prices can remain high - is not who we are.

---

Each generation,
has a chance to redefine the future.

And each chance,
requires but a seed that only later grow into a tree.

The Academy of Art, is just one small idea that life will present to you,
but if it calls to you, then this is your path to Greatness.

  "text": "Once you see that Artistic Realism is within reach,\nthat it is a system of things not a talent.\nYou can get together with your schoolmates,\nand begin building an Art Academy.\n\nBe careful not to charge students up-front tuition,\na real school teaches for free.\nLike a business investor,\ntake a percentage from student's art sales.\nI suggest you ask the student to decide,\nhow much of a cut you should get, allow yearly adjustments.\n\nA painting that comes to life,\nwill keep a museum alive.\nSupports galleries,\nand all the artistic things that connect to it.\nArt Supports artists,\neven the famous ones will come to your online classes.\n\nBuilding the Art Academy,\nmaking it tuition free, but taking a percent cut, is important.\nBut before you get there,\nknow that you will also need to teach all the classes that enable digital painting.\nHow to put a Desktop together, how to install Linux and Krita.\nand so on.\n\nBut you will also need to offer, programming Krita extensions classes,\ncompiling and extending Krita, GIMP, and similar.\nAnd the more art related lectures about Generative Programming,\nhow to write P5.js, how to program SVG files, and make them reactive.\nThe future of the Academy is about becoming a complete and real school,\none that has an independent educational curriculum... from the fantasy education of the standardized curriculum.\n\nYou also have to recognize your limits,\nand that you deserve to have a good stress-fee life.\nThat is why you need help from your friends,\nno one should be burdened or forced into things that don't move them.\nAnd realize that there is no future in centralized education,\nneither brick and mortar nor a website that can shut down.\n\nYour school needs to be distributed the way large computer games are,\nand it needs to operate when disconnected from the internet.\nArt sells, your Academy, can help people out of poverty,\nit must be a reliable program.\nThe online component should be limited to sales,\nhere Dribbble[1] and Creative Market[2] are good examples of an Art Academy store front.\n\nYou also need to invent a new class of software,\nthat will allow for rapid development.\nIt is an event based system,\nwhere things listen and respond to well-named events, for example \"Student Sign-up Form Submission\" or \"Visit To Home Page\"\nEvent based systems can be represented by graphs,\nwhere a node represents an event and an edge (or connecting line) a connection to one of the events that can be triggered from there.\nHowever leave graphs for last,\nbecause you need to build out a collaborative environment first.\nIt works very similar to wikipedia,\nbut articles are the events (or graph nodes).\nWhen the home page of this system opens,\none of the things you will see there is \"Visit To Home Page\" event.\nwhen you click on that,\nyou will find English descriptions of what the visit does, and on a side bar what events can be triggered from there.\nThe text will be written in BDD's Given When Then syntax[3],\nthis will allow the students to collaboratively build the Academy inside out, while leaving the actual programming to developers.\nLike MediaWiki[4] use SQL tables,\nlean from MediaWiki the technology behind WikiPedia for ideas.\n\nYour most difficult challenge is already solved,\noverlaying reference images over the drawing canvas.\nServes as both reference for shapes,\nand a perfect palette.\nThis is a simple idea,\nthat anybody can learn, with minimal practice.\n\nSoon your store-front will fill with art,\nyour crowd-sourcing engine will fill with art requests that your students can fulfill for money, where yo take a percent cut to expand the academy.\nMake no mistake your Academy Of Art,\nis meant to change the world.\nThe academy of Art is meant to save students from debt,\nand offer real education, that shows real results.\n\nPeople of the world need real education,\none that improves their Knowledge, enhances their wisdom, and ignites their greatness.\nThis is necessary for Humanity to advance,\nbeyond broken ideas.\nLack of Universal Income and Tolerance of Poverty,\nor destroying food so that the hungry can't eat it and prices can remain high - is not who we are.\n\nEach generation,\nhas a chance to redefine the future.\nAnd each chance,\nrequires but a seed that only later grow into a tree.\nThe Academy of Art, is just one small idea that life will present to you,\nbut if it calls to you, then this is your path to Greatness.\n\nArtwork story[5],\nTime-lapse video[6].\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://dribbble.com/\n[2]: https://creativemarket.com/\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS6EEUVZGLE\n[4]: https://www.mediawiki.org\n[5]: https://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/sskjka/me_with_my_dog/hxjav22/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[6]: https://youtu.be/ov9m1iTJgSk",

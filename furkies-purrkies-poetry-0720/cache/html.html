  <p>Once you see that Artistic Realism is within reach,<br>that it is a system of things not a talent.</p>
  <p>You can get together with your schoolmates,<br>and begin building an Art Academy.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Be careful not to charge students up-front tuition,<br>a real school teaches for free.</p>
  <p>Like a business investor,<br>take a percentage from student's art sales.</p>
  <p>I suggest you ask the student to decide,<br>how much of a cut you should get, allow yearly adjustments.</p>

  <p>A painting that comes to life,<br>will keep a museum alive.</p>
  <p>Supports galleries,<br>and all the artistic things that connect to it.</p>
  <p>Art Supports artists,<br>even the famous ones will come to your online classes.</p>

  <p>Building the Art Academy,<br>making it tuition free, but taking a percent cut, is important.</p>
  <p>But before you get there,<br>know that you will also need to teach all the classes that enable digital painting.</p>
  <p>How to put a Desktop together, how to install Linux and Krita.<br>and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But you will also need to offer, programming Krita extensions classes,<br>compiling and extending Krita, GIMP, and similar.</p>
  <p>And the more art related lectures about Generative Programming,<br>how to write P5.js, how to program SVG files, and make them reactive.</p>
  <p>The future of the Academy is about becoming a complete and real school,<br>one that has an independent educational curriculum... from the fantasy education of the standardized curriculum.</p>

  <p>You also have to recognize your limits,<br>and that you deserve to have a good stress-fee life.</p>
  <p>That is why you need help from your friends,<br>no one should be burdened or forced into things that don't move them.</p>
  <p>And realize that there is no future in centralized education,<br>neither brick and mortar nor a website that can shut down.</p>

  <p>Your school needs to be distributed the way large computer games are,<br>and it needs to operate when disconnected from the internet.</p>
  <p>Art sells, your Academy, can help people out of poverty,<br>it must be a reliable program.</p>
  <p>The online component should be limited to sales,<br>here <a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a> and <a href="https://creativemarket.com/">Creative Market</a> are good examples of an Art Academy store front.</p>

  <p>You also need to invent a new class of software,<br>that will allow for rapid development.</p>
  <p>It is an event based system,<br>where things listen and respond to well-named events, for example "Student Sign-up Form Submission" or "Visit To Home Page"</p>
  <p>Event based systems can be represented by graphs,<br>where a node represents an event and an edge (or connecting line) a connection to one of the events that can be triggered from there.</p>
  <p>However leave graphs for last,<br>because you need to build out a collaborative environment first.</p>
  <p>It works very similar to wikipedia,<br>but articles are the events (or graph nodes).</p>
  <p>When the home page of this system opens,<br>one of the things you will see there is "Visit To Home Page" event.</p>
  <p>when you click on that,<br>you will find English descriptions of what the visit does, and on a side bar what events can be triggered from there.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS6EEUVZGLE">The text will be written in BDD's Given When Then syntax</a>,<br>this will allow the students to collaboratively build the Academy inside out, while leaving the actual programming to developers.</p>
  <p>Like <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a> use SQL tables,<br>lean from MediaWiki the technology behind WikiPedia for ideas.</p>

  <p>Your most difficult challenge is already solved,<br>overlaying reference images over the drawing canvas.</p>
  <p>Serves as both reference for shapes,<br>and a perfect palette.</p>
  <p>This is a simple idea,<br>that anybody can learn, with minimal practice.</p>

  <p>Soon your store-front will fill with art,<br>your crowd-sourcing engine will fill with art requests that your students can fulfill for money, where yo take a percent cut to expand the academy.</p>
  <p>Make no mistake your Academy Of Art,<br>is meant to change the world.</p>
  <p>The academy of Art is meant to save students from debt,<br>and offer real education, that shows real results.</p>

  <p>People of the world need real education,<br>one that improves their Knowledge, enhances their wisdom, and ignites their greatness.</p>
  <p>This is necessary for Humanity to advance,<br>beyond broken ideas.</p>
  <p>Lack of Universal Income and Tolerance of Poverty,<br>or destroying food so that the hungry can't eat it and prices can remain high - is not who we are.</p>

  <p>Each generation,<br>has a chance to redefine the future.</p>
  <p>And each chance,<br>requires but a seed that only later grow into a tree.</p>
  <p>The Academy of Art, is just one small idea that life will present to you,<br>but if it calls to you, then this is your path to Greatness.</p>

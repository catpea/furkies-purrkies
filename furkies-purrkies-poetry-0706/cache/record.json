and employ the collaborative process behind Wikipedia,<br>and begin building a system similar to a <strong>game</strong>.</p>\n  <p>One of the first fun uses for it,<br>is having the Politicians that are in charge of your future play.</p>\n  <p>This is not just to shame them,<br>the School Game is structured in a way that teaches them, how to play.</p>\n  <p>By playing the game for a little bit,<br>they get a basic education,</p>\n  <p>Even a little bit of a real education,<br>makes them better at what they are supposed to be doing.</p>\n  <p>By playing the game, they get a glimpse of the future,<br>and the consequences of their inactions, and small minded thinking.</p>\n  <p>They get to witness the impact of their flawed decision making,<br>on <strong>your</strong> existence <strong>and</strong> the well being of your Grand Children.</p>\n  <p>Make sure, that there are multiple Open Source school systems in competition with one another,<br>and of course, that the winning one will get translations into all the languages, and that all people can access your school eventually.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The second fun use,<br>is witnessing how young people are much more perceptive and better at learning than we all assumed.</p>\n  <p>Perhaps you can do something, to help the politicians to get ready to have their fat asses handed to them,<br>by foul mouthed twelve year old girls with a superior education - IDK.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I wish I had some proof for you,<br>but Improved Education, is the only road to Global Universal Income.</p>\n  <p>It is a ladder, that the world climbs,<br>and gets higher powers from.</p>\n  <p>Darkly speaking; either way, eventually people would see that there is no future,<br>when they desperately sell out their future generations, just to live their own life.</p>\n  <p>In order for the world to begin healing,<br>poverty must end, for poverty to end, you have to build real schools so that the resulting politicians can see.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Hey, cheer up,<br>you are not alone.</p>\n  <p>The moment you hand in your first blank test,<br>all the Great Beings in the world today, and even those who have already passed.</p>\n  <p>Stand by your side in kinship, friendship, appreciation of your courage,<br>and in the shared vision of a better future, that <strong>is</strong> worthy of us all.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Cramming for tests, and pretending to learn, while everyone fills their pockets with your debts and savings -<br>was never the way forward.</p>\n  <p>And you are not giving anything up,<br>by making your own, more authentic way, though Arts and Sciences.</p>\n  <p>You would have neither found Wisdom, nor Greatness, in the inauthentic path,<br>there was no authentic prestige there, no real graduations or diplomas, - the futures that are worthy of you are the ones that are most authentic.</p>\n  <p>And this idea needs you, we do our best thinking out on the very limits of our mental capacities and this is mine,<br>so take this idea and write, and imagine, and build, and continue until you reach your limits, though with a much finer version than the scraps you found here.</p>\n  <p>Like the better future,<br>your Unimaginable Greatness is well within your reach.</p>\n</div>",

<div class=\"paragraph\">I will show that Universal Income,<br>and Real Education solve the problems you will soon face.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And I will ask you to stage a protest,<br>and build a real school, where people can learn for real.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When the world - that is to say your students - are ready,<br>the money for Basic Income will come from the improved future of the world that does not suffer an irreparable collapse.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Money is an imaginary concept,<br>your generation will eliminate poverty, by extending the concept of money to consider the future that Humanity is headed towards.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Let us begin;</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The backbone of your clock is the health of the Amazon Rain Forest (just because it is an ongoing issue that recently got worse),<br>Insects and Bats are your most powerful indicator, and Tigers, Rhinos and Orangutans represents all the rest you need to measure.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Amazon Rain Forest is important because it is being burned, by the poor, for money,<br>they are helping themselves, at the cost of future generations.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You will find that this \"by the poor, for the money\",<br>is playing a major negative role everywhere.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is also empowering large corporations,<br>and even child labor and slavery.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Money is fine for playing pointless games at Wall St. but it you apply the idea of money to all Humanity,<br>it will

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Amazon is just the first of about a dozen no return points,<br>so, there is plenty of opportunity to get it right.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Do not let these ideas make you sad,<br>I am merely asking you and all the other readers. to become Great Beings.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There is a <strong>very</strong> small chance that people will not know what to do,<br>or that the changes will be so slow, that no single generation will notice the disaster unfold.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But more pressing than talk of distant disasters,<br>is a conversation, about avoiding needless suffering, which doubles a way to prevent said disasters.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We have already shown that Humanity is blind to<br>Mass Incarceration, Hunger and Famine, Poverty and Homelessness, Indoctrination and War, Slavery and Nations that violate Human Rights.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In their un-education, and fantasy lifestyles, <span>politicians are speaking of Earthen Vessels<sup>[1]</sup></span>,<br><span>and they actually attack and try to break the spirits of those who do care about injustice<sup>[2]</sup></span>.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This problem is rooted in fake education,<br><span>and our ability to blindly make sense of crazy at the cost of distancing ourselves from reality and the chance to guide the world<sup>[3]</sup></span>.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><span>Those who did figure out what the real problem is, heartbreakingly for a significant period

of warnings,<br>first.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">As crazy people who think watching the world burn is something that just happens,<br>are going to try to convince you that ending the destruction will destroy the world.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The only thing it will destroy,<br>are the businesses that positioned themselves to make money off of human misery.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You are going to put the company that is destined to sell fresh canned air to your grand kids out of business,<br>and as a separate consequence, also prevent that future from happening.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">By solving the Amazon problem,<br>you will empty many businesses of workers.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">These businesses were built on wage slavery,<br>they took a bet, against advancement of humanity, and it was not a wise bet.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Another counter argument you will hear,<br>is people not doing anything but drugs and pleasure seeking as a result of the changes your generation institutes.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Drug addicts exist because they are escaping pain,<br>they can't quit drugs, as drugs support that escape.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But the solution to the Amazon Rain Forest problem,<br>also solves the suffering of almost all people pushed into addiction.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">They will be able to move,<br>to try to start a new life, in a place they never knew existed, among people they didn't realize could love them.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">More than that, you also solve most crime,<br>the will be no robberies in the world.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You will collapse the Prison Industry,<br>again, the investors there, made a stupid bet, and they should stupidly lose everything - that's how you play the market game, it is the rule.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Of course, it is safe to say, that people who stand against Basic Income and Real Education,<br>are <strong>totally</strong> out of their f***ing minds, and you can, just, ignore, what they have to say.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In fact there is a name for making stupid arguments like that,<br>what they are doing should be called, verbal diarrhea.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And a similar condition,<br>is at the root of <span>Mass Incarceration<sup>[5]</sup></span> in United States.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now without further ado,<br>let me help you to see the beginning.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Better sit down,for this one,<br>as this is basically the opposite of what you are told to do.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I also won't make this an abrupt process,<br>that will stress you out - but a slow one that will give you the strength you need.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Stop memorizing, stop cramming before tests,<br>but for every class you fail, you need to learn a new talent.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Stuff like 3D Modeling and Printing, Making Electronic Circuits,<br>Programming, and programming single board computers and their pin boards to taste robotics...</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Learning Digital Painting In Krita, or Graffiti Art with wall projectors,<br>even <span>Crossing great trails<sup>[6]</sup></span> and Survival Training.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is called a real education, learning things that move you,<br>that call to you.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Year after year, as you learn more and more, you begin learning faster and faster,<br>and somehow understand more and more of the world we live in.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You transmute, Real Knowledge,<br>into Wisdom.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This transmutation,<br>only works with functional knowledge.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To use a car analogy,<br>a toy car can't get you across town.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So, the text time yo are handed a test or pop quiz,<br>slowly begin imagining what will happen when you hand it in blank.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Just relax,<br>it does not have to be your first, or third, or even fifth test.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Just imagine,<br>rising.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And when you are ready,<br>you hand it in blank.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Maybe use your power and growing wisdom,<br>to legibly scribble

that is to say your students - are ready,\nthe money for Basic Income will come from the improved future of the world that does not suffer an irreparable collapse.\nMoney is an imaginary concept,\nyour generation will eliminate poverty, by extending the concept of money to consider the future that Humanity is headed towards.\nLet us begin;\n\nThe backbone of your clock is the health of the Amazon Rain Forest (just because it is an ongoing issue that recently got worse),\nInsects and Bats are your most powerful indicator, and Tigers, Rhinos and Orangutans represents all the rest you need to measure.\nThe Amazon Rain Forest is important because it is being burned, by the poor, for money,\nthey are helping themselves, at the cost of future generations.\nYou will find that this \"by the poor, for the money\",\nis playing a major negative role everywhere.\nIt is also empowering large corporations,\nand even child labor and slavery.\n\nMoney is fine for playing pointless games at Wall St. but it you apply the idea of money to all Humanity,\nit will be its silent and imperceptible undoing.\n\nAmazon is just the first of about a dozen no return points,\nso, there is plenty of opportunity to get it right.\nDo not let these ideas make you sad,\nI am merely asking you and all the other readers. to become Great Beings.\n\nThere is a very small chance that people will not know what to do,\nor that the changes will be so slow, that no single generation will notice the disaster unfold.\nBut more pressing than talk of distant disasters,\nis a conversation, about avoiding needless suffering, which doubles a way to prevent said disasters.\nWe have already shown that Humanity is blind to\nMass Incarceration, Hunger and Famine, Poverty and Homelessness, Indoctrination and War, Slavery and Nations that violate Human Rights.\n\nIn their un-education, and fantasy lifestyles, politicians are speaking of Earthen Vessels[1],\nand they actually attack and try to break the spirits of those who do care about injustice[2].\nThis problem is rooted in fake education,\nand our ability to blindly make sense of crazy at the cost of distancing ourselves from reality and the chance to guide the world[3].\nThose who did figure out what the real problem is, heartbreakingly for a significant period of time, have also maxed out their mental capacity to continue moving forward at the same pace[4],\nas no singe person can correct the problem, it will take a generation.\n\nLet us not speak in broad abstract terms here,\nwe need to isolate an enormous problem, and fix it.\nAnd then by subtle analogy,\napply a slight variation of the fix to everything else,\n\nThe Amazon Rain Forest is your first challenge,\nhow do you get the farmers to stop burning it?\n\nLet me give you a couple of warnings,\nfirst.\nAs crazy people who think watching the world burn is something that just happens,\nare going to try to convince you that ending the destruction will destroy the world.\nThe only thing it will destroy,\nare the businesses that positioned themselves to make money off of human misery.\nYou are going to put the company that is destined to sell fresh canned air to your grand kids out of business,\nand as a separate consequence, also prevent that future from happening.\n\nBy solving the Amazon problem,\nyou will empty many businesses of workers.\nThese businesses were built on wage slavery,\nthey took a bet, against advancement of humanity, and it was not a wise bet.\n\nAnother counter argument you will hear,\nis people not doing anything but drugs and pleasure seeking as a result of the changes your generation institutes.\nDrug addicts exist because they are escaping pain,\nthey can't quit drugs, as drugs support that escape.\nBut the solution to the Amazon Rain Forest problem,\nalso solves the suffering of almost all people pushed into addiction.\nThey will be able to move,\nto try to start a new life, in a place they never knew existed, among people they didn't realize could love them.\nMore than that, you also solve most crime,\nthe will be no robberies in the world.\nYou will collapse the Prison Industry,\nagain, the investors there, made a stupid bet, and they should stupidly lose everything - that's how you play the market game, it is the rule.\n\nOf course, it is safe to say, that people who stand against Basic Income and Real Education,\nare totally out of their f***ing minds, and you can, just, ignore, what they have to say.\nIn fact there is a name for making stupid arguments like that,\nwhat they are doing should be called, verbal diarrhea.\nAnd a similar condition,\nis at the root of Mass Incarceration[5] in United States.\n\nNow without further ado,\nlet me help you to see the beginning.\nBetter sit down,for this one,\nas this is basically the opposite of what you are told to do.\nI also won't make this an abrupt process,\nthat will stress you out - but a slow one that will give you the strength you need.\n\nStop memorizing, stop cramming before tests,\nbut for every class you fail, you need to learn a new talent.\nStuff like 3D Modeling and Printing, Making Electronic Circuits,\nProgramming, and programming single board computers and their pin boards to taste robotics...\nLearning Digital Painting In Krita, or Graffiti Art with wall projectors,\neven Crossing great trails[6] and Survival Training.\nThis is called a real education, learning things that move you,\nthat call to you.\nYear after year, as you learn more and more, you begin learning faster and faster,\nand somehow understand more and more of the world we live in.\nYou transmute, Real Knowledge,\ninto Wisdom.\nThis transmutation,\nonly works with functional knowledge.\nTo use a car analogy,\na toy car can't get you across town.\n\nSo, the text time yo are handed a test or pop quiz,\nslowly begin imagining what will happen when you hand it in blank.\nJust relax,\nit does not have to be your first, or third, or even fifth test.\nJust imagine,\nrising.\nAnd when you are ready,\nyou hand it in blank.\nMaybe use your power and growing wisdom,\nto legibly scribble to your teacher some words of wisdom.\nDon't make enemies,\na lot of the fake teachers, would end up teaching for real, if they had strong Universal Income protecting them from... destruction, basically.\nYou need to team up with others,\nkeep an eye on the back row, but set the so called smart kids free, first.\nOnce you are all suspended,\nor put on some mad and scary academic suspension - organize, and stay in the news.\nGive talks, stage walks,\nhand out notes, get a microphone and tell everyone what they are already thinking, what they have been ready to hear forever and a half.\nThe schools have been making a fool out you[7],\nthey are taking advantage of your lack of experience in a way you can't prove[8], the text books are a scam[9], and you don't just need debt forgiveness, you need a fu***ng refund.\nYou are staging a global protest against fake education,\nfake education is a problem even the most brilliant of us haven't quite noticed yet[10].\n\nAs with all movements,\nyou will need a common objective you can all converge on.\nAnd that is of course,\nthe real school.\n\nAnother warning, the fortunes of many institutions that have bet on the end of humanity are at stake here,\nparasitic corporations and individuals will attack you with a might you, will, not, see coming, until it is too late.\nThey will manipulate you with ideas,\nthat you will not be able to recognize in time, as false.\nPlease, do not elect a leader,\nas they will easily derail your movement.\nRule by the force of a massively multiplayer round table,\nwhere only the voice of the brilliant many can speak.\nSpeed thy,\nslowly.\n\nYou must understand and employ the collaborative process behind Wikipedia,\nand begin building a system similar to a game.\nOne of the first fun uses for it,\nis having the Politicians that are in charge of your future play.\nThis is not just to shame them,\nthe School Game is structured in a way that teaches them, how to play.\nBy playing the game for a little bit,\nthey get a basic education,\nEven a little bit of a real education,\nmakes them better at what they are supposed to be doing.\nBy playing the game, they get a glimpse of the future,\nand the consequences of their inactions, and small minded thinking.\nThey get to witness the impact of their flawed decision making,\non your existence and the well being of your Grand Children.\nMake sure, that there are multiple Open Source school systems in competition with one another,\nand of course, that the winning one will get translations into all the languages, and that all people can access your school eventually.\n\nThe second fun use,\nis witnessing how young people are much more perceptive and better at learning than we all assumed.\nPerhaps you can do something, to help the politicians to get ready to have their fat asses handed to them,\nby foul mouthed twelve year old girls with a superior education - IDK.\n\nI wish I had some proof for you,\nbut Improved Education, is the only road to Global Universal Income.\nIt is a ladder, that the world climbs,\nand gets higher powers from.\nDarkly speaking; either way, eventually people would see that there is no future,\nwhen they desperately sell out their future generations, just to live their own life.\nIn order for the world to begin healing,\npoverty must end, for poverty to end, you have to build real schools so that the resulting politicians can see.\n\nHey, cheer up,\nyou are not alone.\nThe moment you hand in your first blank test,\nall the Great Beings in the world today, and even those who have already passed.\nStand by your side in kinship, friendship, appreciation of your courage,\nand in the shared vision of a better future, that is worthy of us all.\n\nCramming for tests, and pretending to learn, while everyone fills their pockets with your debts and savings -\nwas never the way forward.\nAnd you are not giving anything up,\nby making your own, more authentic way, though Arts and Sciences.\nYou would have neither found Wisdom, nor Greatness, in the inauthentic path,\nthere was no authentic prestige there, no real graduations or diplomas, - the futures that are worthy of you are the ones that are most authentic.\nAnd this idea needs you, we do our best thinking out on the very limits of our mental capacities and this is mine,\nso take this idea and write, and imagine, and build, and continue until you reach your limits, though with a much finer version than the scraps you found here.\nLike the better future,\nyour Unimaginable Greatness is well within your reach.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE8Q42Zzqgk\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugedlHy8Pc\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T76FdtKreNQ\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\n[5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUanS5OWy_k\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5o1w5TlCaE\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFpPCfBhNWQ\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa-IHN9_3Uw",

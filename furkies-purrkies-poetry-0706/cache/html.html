  <p>I will introduce you to a clock,<br>that you can use as a memory stick.</p>
  <p>I will show that Universal Income,<br>and Real Education solve the problems you will soon face.</p>
  <p>And I will ask you to stage a protest,<br>and build a real school, where people can learn for real.</p>
  <p>When the world - that is to say the students - are ready,<br>the money for Basic Income will come from the improved future of the world that does not suffer an irreparable collapse.</p>
  <p>Money is an imaginary concept,<br>your generation will eliminate poverty, by extending the concept of money to consider the future that Humanity is headed towards.</p>
  <p>Let us begin;</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>The backbone of your clock is the health of the Amazon Rain Forest (just because it is an ongoing issue that recently got worse),<br>Insects and Bats are your most powerful indicator, and Tigers, Rhinos and Orangutans represents all the rest you need to measure.</p>
  <p>The Amazon Rain Forest is important because it is being burned, by the poor, for money,<br>they are helping themselves, at the cost of future generations.</p>
  <p>You will find that this "by the poor, for the money",<br>is playing a major negative role everywhere.</p>
  <p>It is also empowering large corporations,<br>and even child labor and slavery.</p>

  <p>Money is fine for playing pointless games at Wall St. but it you apply the idea of money to all Humanity,<br>it will be its silent and imperceptible undoing.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Amazon is just the first of about a dozen no return points,<br>so, there is plenty of opportunity to get it right.</p>
  <p>Do not let these ideas make you sad,<br>I am merely asking you and all the other readers. to become Great Beings.</p>

  <p>There is a <strong>very</strong> small chance that people will not know what to do,<br>or that the changes will be so slow, that no single generation will notice the disaster unfold.</p>
  <p>But more pressing than talk of distant disasters,<br>is a conversation, about avoiding needless suffering, which doubles a way to prevent said disasters.</p>
  <p>We have already shown that Humanity is blind to<br>Mass Incarceration, Hunger and Famine, Poverty and Homelessness, Indoctrination and War, Slavery and Nations that violate Human Rights.</p>

  <p>In their un-education, and fantasy lifestyles, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE8Q42Zzqgk">politicians are speaking of Earthen Vessels</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wugedlHy8Pc">and they actually attack and try to break the spirits of those who do care about injustice</a>.</p>
  <p>This problem is rooted in fake education,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T76FdtKreNQ">and our ability to blindly make sense of crazy at the cost of distancing ourselves from reality and the chance to guide the world</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts">Those who did figure out what the real problem is, heartbreakingly for a significant period of time, have also maxed out their mental capacity to continue moving forward at the same pace</a>,<br>as no singe person can correct the problem, it will take a generation.</p>

  <p>Let us not speak in broad abstract terms here,<br>we need to isolate an enormous problem, and fix it.</p>
  <p>And then by subtle analogy,<br>apply a slight variation of the fix to everything else,</p>

  <p>The Amazon Rain Forest is your first challenge,<br>how do you get the farmers to stop burning it?</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Let me give you a couple of warnings,<br>first.</p>
  <p>As crazy people who think watching the world burn is something that just happens,<br>are going to try to convince you that ending the destruction will destroy the world.</p>
  <p>The only thing it will destroy,<br>are the businesses that positioned themselves to make money off of human misery.</p>
  <p>You are going to put the company that is destined to sell fresh canned air to your grand kids out of business,<br>and as a separate consequence, also prevent that future from happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>By solving the Amazon problem,<br>you will empty many businesses of workers.</p>
  <p>These businesses were built on wage slavery,<br>they took a bet, against advancement of humanity, and it was not a wise bet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Another counter argument you will hear,<br>is people not doing anything but drugs and pleasure seeking as a result of the changes your generation institutes.</p>
  <p>Drug addicts exist because they are escaping pain,<br>they can't quit drugs, as drugs support that escape.</p>
  <p>But the solution to the Amazon Rain Forest problem,<br>also solves the suffering of almost all people pushed into addiction.</p>
  <p>They will be able to move,<br>to try to start a new life, in a place they never knew existed, among people they didn't realize could love them.</p>
  <p>More than that, you also solve most crime,<br>the will be no robberies in the world.</p>
  <p>You will collapse the Prison Industry,<br>again, the investors there, made a stupid bet, and they should stupidly lose everything - that's how you play the market game, it is the rule.</p>

  <p>Of course, it is safe to say, that people who stand against Basic Income and Real Education,<br>are <strong>totally</strong> out of their f***ing minds, and you can, just, ignore, what they have to say.</p>
  <p>In fact there is a name for making stupid arguments like that,<br>what they are doing should be called, verbal diarrhea.</p>
  <p>And a similar condition,<br>is at the root of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States">Mass Incarceration</a> in United States.</p>

  <p>Now without further ado,<br>let me help you to see the beginning.</p>
  <p>Better sit down,for this one,<br>as this is basically the opposite of what you are told to do.</p>
  <p>I also won't make this an abrupt process,<br>that will stress you out - but a slow one that will give you the strength you need.</p>

  <p>Stop memorizing, stop cramming before tests,<br>but for every class you fail, you need to learn a new talent.</p>
  <p>Stuff like 3D Modeling and Printing, Making Electronic Circuits,<br>Programming, and programming single board computers and their pin boards to taste robotics...</p>
  <p>Learning Digital Painting In Krita, or Graffiti Art with wall projectors,<br>even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Crossing great trails</a> and Survival Training.</p>
  <p>This is called a real education, learning things that move you,<br>that call to you.</p>
  <p>Year after year, as you learn more and more, you begin learning faster and faster,<br>and somehow understand more and more of the world we live in.</p>
  <p>You transmute, Real Knowledge,<br>into Wisdom.</p>
  <p>This transmutation,<br>only works with functional knowledge.</p>
  <p>To use a car analogy,<br>a toy car can't get you across town.</p>

  <p>So, the text time yo are handed a test or pop quiz,<br>slowly begin imagining what will happen when you hand it in blank.</p>
  <p>Just relax,<br>it does not have to be your first, or third, or even fifth test.</p>
  <p>Just imagine,<br>rising.</p>
  <p>And when you are ready,<br>you hand it in blank.</p>
  <p>Maybe use your power and growing wisdom,<br>to legibly scribble to your teacher some words of wisdom.</p>
  <p>Don't make enemies,<br>a lot of the fake teachers, would end up teaching for real, if they had strong Universal Income protecting them from... destruction, basically.</p>
  <p>You need to team up with others,<br>keep an eye on the back row, but set the so called smart kids free, first.</p>
  <p>Once you are all suspended,<br>or put on some mad and scary academic suspension - organize, and stay in the news.</p>
  <p>Give talks, stage walks,<br>hand out notes, get a microphone and tell everyone what they are already thinking, what they have been ready to hear forever and a half.</p>
  <p>The schools have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUanS5OWy_k">making a fool out you</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5o1w5TlCaE">they are taking advantage of your lack of experience in a way you can't prove</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFpPCfBhNWQ">the text books are a scam</a>, and you don't just need debt forgiveness, you need a fu***ng refund.</p>
  <p>You are staging a global protest against fake education,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa-IHN9_3Uw">fake education is a problem even the most brilliant of us haven't quite noticed yet</a>.</p>

  <p>Another warning, the fortunes of many institutions that have bet on the end of humanity are at stake here,<br>parasitic corporations and individuals will attack you with a might you, will, not, see coming, until it is too late.</p>
  <p>They will manipulate you with ideas,<br>that you will not be able to recognize in time, as false.</p>
  <p>Please, <strong>do not</strong> elect a leader,<br>as they will easily derail your movement.</p>
  <p>Rule by the force of a massively multiplayer round table,<br>where only the voice of the brilliant many can speak.</p>

  <p>You must understand and employ the collaborative process behind Wikipedia,<br>and begin building a system similar to a <strong>game</strong>.</p>
  <p>One of the first fun uses for it,<br>is having the Politicians that are in charge of your future play.</p>
  <p>This is not just to shame them,<br>the School Game is structured in a way that teaches them, how to play.</p>
  <p>By playing the game for a little bit,<br>they get a basic education,</p>
  <p>Even a little bit of a real education,<br>makes them better at what they are supposed to be doing.</p>
  <p>By playing the game, they get a glimpse of the future,<br>and the consequences of their inactions, and small minded thinking.</p>
  <p>They get to witness the impact of their flawed decision making,<br>on <strong>your</strong> existence <strong>and</strong> the well being of your Grand Children.</p>
  <p>Make sure, that there are multiple Open Source school systems in competition with one another,<br>and of course, that the winning one will get translations into all the languages, and that all people can access your school eventually.</p>

  <p>The second fun use,<br>is witnessing how young people are much more perceptive and better at learning than we all assumed.</p>
  <p>Perhaps you can do something, to help the politicians to get ready to have their fat asses handed to them,<br>by foul mouthed twelve year old girls with a superior education - IDK.</p>

  <p>I wish I had some proof for you,<br>but Improved Education, is the only road to Global Universal Income.</p>
  <p>It is a ladder, that the world climbs,<br>and gets higher powers from.</p>
  <p>Darkly speaking; either way, eventually people would see that there is no future,<br>when they desperately sell out their future generations, just to live their own life.</p>
  <p>In order for the world to begin healing,<br>poverty must end, for poverty to end, you have to build real schools so that the resulting politicians can see.</p>

  <p>Hey, cheer up,<br>you are not alone.</p>
  <p>The moment you hand in your first blank test,<br>all the Great Beings in the world today, and even those who have already passed.</p>

  <p>Cramming for tests, and pretending to learn, while everyone fills their pockets with your debts and savings -<br>was never the way forward.</p>
  <p>And you are not giving anything up,<br>by making your own, more authentic way, though Arts and Sciences.</p>
  <p>You would have neither found Wisdom, nor Greatness, in the inauthentic path,<br>there was no authentic prestige there, no real graduations or diplomas, - the futures that are worthy of you are the ones that are most authentic.</p>
  <p>And this idea needs you, we do our best thinking out on the very limits of our mental capacities and this is mine,<br>so take this idea and write, and imagine, and build, and continue until you reach your limits, though with a much finer version than the scraps you found here.</p>
  <p>Like the better future,<br>your Unimaginable Greatness is well within your reach.</p>

  <p>There is nothing fancier than Art,<br>and it is never too late to start.</p>
  <p>And creating your own art,<br>is a sure way to become super smart.</p>
  <p>And all you need to start,<br>is your heart.</p>

  <p>If you are not sure what to create,<br>take a picture of a fat cat that just ate.</p>
  <p>Make getting the shape right your first goal,<br>use a transparent layer or project it on a wall.</p>
  <p>Meditate and flow with the shape,<br>as painting can be a kind of escape.</p>

  <p>With a touch or reflection,<br>you will become art-smart by your 50th projection.</p>
  <p>As you notice that negative space wants to flow,<br>shapes, will become islands of tomorrow.</p>
  <p>You will see that you never create a portrait,<br>you just build and wait.</p>

  <p>Art helps us become whole.<br>it is a major part of our soul.</p>

  <p>Believe in your own mind-and-might,<br>and that your brilliance can add to make the world bright.</p>
  <p>It is a path to self education,<br>a path towards a real graduation.</p>
  <p>A path beyond Horace's Carpe Diem,<br>one to wake you from slumber and dream.</p>

  <p>Neither pluck nor seize a day,<br>adding them all together is the right way.</p>
  <p>Day to day, thought to thought, art to art,<br>rise far beyond merely wishing to be smart.</p>
  <p>Let art awaken your power of seeing,<br>so that you may become a Great Being.</p>

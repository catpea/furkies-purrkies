way to prevent the repeat of this situation,<br>some 20 years from now with a dictator next door.</p>\n  <p>Is to stop being afraid of the things that are preventing us from growing up,<br>like going

<hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is not possible to fully explain the gravity of the necessity of goring all the way up,<br>and the impact a wiser and more advanced world has on

that they can use charcoal from their fire to create hyper-realistic portraits.</p>\n  <p>They were too stressed out, too caught up in daily matters,<br>all too obedient to whatever flavor of ruler

in fury and rage scream that retribution is vile and evil.</p>\n  <p>And that is even without considering the fact,<br>that our criminals are just normal human beings who have been made often

to prevent the situation where people are fractured by poverty,<br>we are creating our criminals.</p>\n  <p>It would be easy to say,<br>that we are doing so by means of ignorance, or sometimes arrogance.</p>\n  <p>But actually, it is our global culture,<br>and the lack of advancement, the lack of us taking the responsibility to face all fear and grow all the way up.</p>\n  <p>The same exact thing separates Middle Ages from Modern Days,<br>and we call it culture.</p>\n  <p>Few monks aside, the culture in middle ages did not include reading books,<br>or aiming to advance the world, pas the local settlement.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Famous thinkers aside, we both share the same mistake,<br>the mistake of thinking that we can't be geniuses, or that growing all the way up is optional.</p>\n  <p>It is a cultural,<br>mistake.</p>\n  <p>You were born a Genius,<br>but you didn't know, because the modern culture makes those people seem genetically superior, and they are not.</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ebQK7evbw\">Einstein was riding imaginary trains</a>,<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUVSHDbAeM\">Hawking spinning backwards</a>.</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALRdYPMpqQs\">Newtons three laws are child's play</a>,<br>the

chose not to stop but kept going forward on their own path aiming to become their wisest selves.</p>\n  <p>Each of these three men had difficult lives,<br>children of today can accomplish far more...</p>\n  <p>So as long as our culture helps them understand,<br>that the only fearsome thing there is, is fear of the unknown.</p>\n  <p>And the fear of the unknown,<br>is so terrible, because if we don't know to ignore it, or challenge it, we will not grow up.</p>\n  <p>In which case Humanity will fail to advance,<br>and will <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7ljlMS_cLQ\">continue

and paycheck,<br>by means of hoop jumping ineffective education.</p>\n  <p>We must rise to stand in relentless pursuit of greatness,<br>that is the only way that humanity can advance.</p>\n  <p>Until then, Humanity <strong>will be</strong> locked in a circle,<br>repeating its mistakes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All it takes is preventing fear,<br>from interfering with us, growing all the way up.</p>\n  <p>Don't be scared of the uncertainty,<br>that comes from continued authentic self education.</p>\n  <p>Do not tolerate ineffective education,<br>if you are not learning in school, take to self education.</p>\n  <p>The modern age gives you the opportunity,<br>to listen to all the books that you need to continue growing all the way up - it has never been easier.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Do not feed the profiteering gluttons behind college loans,<br>and actors and

uncertain terms,\nconsider all those currently walking the world's greatest trails from start t o end and book in hand[2].\n\nIt is not possible to fully explain the gravity of the necessity of goring all the way up,\nand the impact a wiser and more advanced world has on Education, Politics, and The Wold.\nBut we can look back in history,\nto men and women who were just as intelligent as you and I...\nBut were unaware of Philosophy, Geometry,\nor that they can use charcoal from their fire to create hyper-realistic portraits.\nThey were too stressed out, too caught up in daily matters,\nall too obedient to whatever flavor of ruler presided over them.\nYou don't even have to go back to the ancient times,\njuries from just a few decades ago thought they were wise for supporting American Segregation.\nIt would not occur to majority of them, to stand up to a judge,\nin fury, in rage, and dignity an nobility and authenticity.\nJust like it does not occur to you, to stand up to a judge today,\nand in fury and rage scream that retribution is vile and evil.\nAnd that is even without considering the fact,\nthat our criminals are just normal human beings who have been made often permanently ill by poverty.\nPoverty that we tolerate by not rising to greatness,\nthat we sustain by never challenging it as a stupid f&cking idea.\nIn a sentence by doing nothing to prevent the situation where people are fractured by poverty,\nwe are creating our criminals.\nIt would be easy to say,\nthat we are doing so by means of ignorance, or sometimes arrogance.\nBut actually, it is our global culture,\nand the lack of advancement, the lack of us taking the responsibility to face all fear and grow all the way up.\nThe same exact thing separates Middle Ages from Modern Days,\nand we call it culture.\nFew monks aside, the culture in middle ages did not include reading books,\nor aiming to advance the world, pas the local settlement.\n\nFamous thinkers aside, we both share the same mistake,\nthe mistake of thinking that we can't be geniuses, or that growing all the way up is optional.\nIt is a cultural,\nmistake.\nYou were born a Genius,\nbut you didn't know, because the modern culture makes those people seem genetically superior, and they are not.\nEinstein was riding imaginary trains[3],\nHawking spinning backwards[4].\nNewtons three laws are child's play[5],\nthe apple didn't hist his head, he merely wondered what would happen if he kept throwing it farther and farther.\nWhat made those people special was not their inventions,\nit was that they chose not to stop but kept going forward on their own path aiming to become their wisest selves.\nEach of these three men had difficult lives,\nchildren of today can accomplish far more...\nSo as long as our culture helps them understand,\nthat the only fearsome thing there is, is fear of the unknown.\nAnd the fear of the unknown,\nis so terrible, because if we don't know to ignore it, or challenge it, we will not grow up.\nIn which case Humanity will fail to advance,\nand will continue repeating the same mistakes in a MAD circle[6].\n\nOur culture is missing an important component,\nthe tradition of parents asking their children to grow all the way up until they become wise and great beings.\nBecause of the continued nuclear thereat of uneducated leaders stockpiling world destroying weapons,\nwe all have grew up under the threat of Mutually Assured Destruction.\nIn that way,\nthe houses that we have built are houses of cards.\nRather than pursuit of career and paycheck,\nby means of hoop jumping ineffective education.\nWe must rise to stand in relentless pursuit of greatness,\nthat is the only way that humanity can advance.\nUntil then, Humanity will be locked in a circle,\nrepeating its mistakes.\n\nAll it takes is preventing fear,\nfrom interfering with us, growing all the way up.\nDon't be scared of the uncertainty,\nthat comes from continued authentic self education.\nDo not tolerate ineffective education,\nif you are not learning in school, take to self education.\nThe modern age gives you the opportunity,\nto listen to all the books that you need to continue growing all the way up - it has never been easier.\n\nDo not feed the profiteering gluttons behind college loans,\nand actors and celebrity politicians; exactly what they want you to give them.\nDo not build a house of cards,\nunder the threat of Mutually Assured Destruction.\nRise and take to wisdom initializing a culture of growing all the way up in Dignity and Authenticity,\nto your family, and the future of younger generations.\nLet us advance our culture today,\nas there are far too many threats in not too distant future.\n\nThis poem begun with \"The only thing you have to fear is fear it self\",\nexplaining that authentic wisdom is better than inauthentic education and careers likely to have negative impact on mental health.\nLet us end by paraphrasing another president,\n\"Our problems are human-made, therefore they can be easily solved by humans.\"\nLet us use our predisposition for Wisdom and Greatness to undo our mistakes,\nand grant the younger generations, a bright future - without a worry in sight.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://youtu.be/WY_pWZIhrKg?t=162\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ebQK7evbw\n[4]:

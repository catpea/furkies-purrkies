  <p>"The only thing you have to fear is fear it self",<br>holds true for growing all the way up.</p>
  <p>Like the power of endurance,<br>which just takes a couple of years.</p>
  <p>And demand that we <strong>gradually</strong> increase,<br>the workout load and complexity.</p>
  <p>We have many superpowers,<br>stored behind some impossible to skip things.</p>
  <p>In a word,<br>only the worthy.</p>
  <p>In fact there are superpowers,<br>we shouldn't just speak of in passing.</p>

  <p>Helping you understand what that means,<br>is noble enough to yet again call upon Dr. Frankl.</p>
  <p>"We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.<br>They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing:<br>the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."</p>
  <p>We can invent Philosophies and even Fantasies as the cases is with religion,<br>to shield our minds and grant us ten minutes more to no end.</p>
  <p>No such thing can be conjured up at the snap of fingers,<br>like in superhero movies.</p>
  <p>Like with endurance workouts,<br>it is a result of some challenging sum of.</p>
  <p>When Dr. Frankl states that Success will ensue,<br>that also holds true for superpowers, they ensue from the choices we make.</p>
  <p>"For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue,<br>and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself<br>or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.<br>Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it."</p>

  <p>Such is the case with Genius,<br>we are not just capable of it, we are pre-disposed for it.</p>
  <p>But there is a requirement,<br>a series of pursuits, that eventually, add to become more than the mere sum the parts.</p>
  <p>Genius is born from having explored so many things,<br>that they create a body of knowledge, that we can apply by subtle analogy, to problems we have never encountered before.</p>

  <p>It is important,<br>that we define our terms at this point.</p>
  <p>Genius is not a positive word,<br>it a a narrow-mined and elitist word, often used to belittle others.</p>
  <p>And most commonly, ti has the effect,<br>of tricking a person into thinking:</p>
  <p>"Since I am not a genius,<br>I will never become as great as <strong>that</strong> person"</p>
  <p>What you are really thinking of when using the word Genius,<br>is Lover Of Wisdom, or Philo-Sophia, or Philosopher.</p>
  <p>Becoming a Philosopher is an important part,<br>of growing all the way up.</p>
  <p>And growing all the way up,<br>means, becoming a Great Being.</p>
  <p>In other words,<br>the wisest possible you...</p>
  <p>That you become,<br>when you don't let fear stop you from growing up.</p>

  <p>The most common fear that we all experience,<br>is the fear of homelessness and fear of being hungry.</p>
  <p>That is what lies at the very bottom,<br>of the structure that we construct to push ourselves away from it.</p>
  <p>In a wiser world this would be the correct thing to do,<br>though this would be a simple political issue and no Human Being would even need to ponder it much.</p>
  <p>Just like almost everyone on earth today,<br>is born free, and not to slavery.</p>
  <p>When the future arrives,<br>we will not have to worry about hunger and homelessness exactly the same way.</p>

  <p>In the imperfect world that we live today,<br>School, Grades, GPA, Student Loans, including advanced degrees...</p>
  <p>Followed by career paths, work health balance, impact of career on family and our mental and physical health,<br>and finally the issue of living life instead of spending our best years in an office cubicle.</p>
  <p>Are incomplete, some have become corrupt,<br>the idea of pressing a bad grade upon a child easily able to become what most all genius or gifted with the correct training.</p>
  <p>Even by handing a child an A,<br>we are already warping their perception of intelligence.</p>
  <p>Presenting the notion of inferior students,<br>and forcing the student into obedience rather than intellectual independence.</p>
  <p>The matter of mental health is the second most important example,<br>while students are suffering mental health issues due to ineffective education.</p>
  <p>Symptoms of which reveal themselves in thinking "drugs are cool", "you got to try this, Dude",<br>or thinking that to become a man, one needs to get laid.</p>
  <p>This notion of getting lucky, is actually a <a href="https://youtu.be/WY_pWZIhrKg?t=162">predatory attack</a> on an an emotionally unhealthily person",<br>a person who would not be in that place, had they been well.</p>
  <p>It is not just alcohol that warps a person's mind and render consent invalid,<br>misfortune, pain, misery, misunderstands are far more unraveling than drugs.</p>
  <p>But the question of mental health,<br>gets even worse as we start growing up.</p>
  <p>This structure we built away from hunger and homelessness,<br>with things that often take advantage of us.</p>
  <p>Like student loans, especially as the degree we aim for becomes more advanced,<br>and jobs that pay as little as they can, never adjust for inflation, and replace us as soon as they can.</p>
  <p>Prevents us from easily finding serenity in life,<br>by means of stress and fear, and even more complex things.</p>
  <p>Such us forcing us to make choices to prevent us,<br>from staying on the road of growing all the way up.</p>
  <p>Almost everyone gives up on adventure,<br>to maximize their performance.</p>
  <p>Slowly, and seemingly reasonably we depart,<br>from our sacred roads of wisdom growing all the way up.</p>
  <p>Alas, that is not reasonable,<br>not only is it your right to become the wisest you.</p>
  <p>But also when people fail to reach that state,<br>the world stops advancing forward.</p>
  <p>A humanity that does not advance,<br>is stuck in a circle of inauthentic politicians, and unhinged dictators.</p>
  <p>Today the person who deices whether or not Nuclear War is about to occur,<br>is clearly a creature whose mind has long unraveled</p>
  <p>Today, a person who does not wince a the loss of 30,000 lives,<br>and some 75,000 injured, decides the fate of the world.</p>
  <p>The only way to prevent the repeat of this situation,<br>some 20 years from now with a dictator next door.</p>
  <p>Is to stop being afraid of the things that are preventing us from growing up,<br>like going hungry for a while or being homeless.</p>
  <p>To give an extreme example, of people who are doing just that, and in <strong>no uncertain terms</strong>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">consider all those currently walking the world's greatest trails from start t o end and book in hand</a>.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to fully explain the gravity of the necessity of goring all the way up,<br>and the impact a wiser and more advanced world has on Education, Politics, and The Wold.</p>
  <p>But we can look back in history,<br>to men and women who were just as intelligent as you and I...</p>
  <p>But were unaware of Philosophy, Geometry,<br>or that they can use charcoal from their fire to create hyper-realistic portraits.</p>
  <p>They were too stressed out, too caught up in daily matters,<br>all too obedient to whatever flavor of ruler presided over them.</p>
  <p>You don't even have to go back to the ancient times,<br>juries from just a few decades ago thought they were wise for supporting American Segregation.</p>
  <p>It would not occur to majority of them, to stand up to a judge,<br>in fury, in rage, and dignity an nobility and authenticity.</p>
  <p>Just like it does not occur to you, to stand up to a judge today,<br>and in fury and rage scream that retribution is vile and evil.</p>
  <p>And that is even without considering the fact,<br>that our criminals are just normal human beings who have been made often permanently ill by poverty.</p>
  <p>Poverty that we tolerate by not rising to greatness,<br>that we sustain by never challenging it as a stupid f&cking idea.</p>
  <p>In a sentence by doing nothing to prevent the situation where people are fractured by poverty,<br>we are creating our criminals.</p>
  <p>It would be easy to say,<br>that we are doing so by means of ignorance, or sometimes arrogance.</p>
  <p>But actually, it is our global culture,<br>and the lack of advancement, the lack of us taking the responsibility to face all fear and grow all the way up.</p>
  <p>The same exact thing separates Middle Ages from Modern Days,<br>and we call it culture.</p>
  <p>Few monks aside, the culture in middle ages did not include reading books,<br>or aiming to advance the world, pas the local settlement.</p>

  <p>Famous thinkers aside, we both share the same mistake,<br>the mistake of thinking that we can't be geniuses, or that growing all the way up is optional.</p>
  <p>It is a cultural,<br>mistake.</p>
  <p>You were born a Genius,<br>but you didn't know, because the modern culture makes those people seem genetically superior, and they are not.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ebQK7evbw">Einstein was riding imaginary trains</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUVSHDbAeM">Hawking spinning backwards</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALRdYPMpqQs">Newtons three laws are child's play</a>,<br>the apple didn't hist his head, he merely wondered what would happen if he kept throwing it farther and farther.</p>
  <p>What made those people special was not their inventions,<br>it was that they chose not to stop but kept going forward on their own path aiming to become their wisest selves.</p>
  <p>Each of these three men had difficult lives,<br>children of today can accomplish far more...</p>
  <p>So as long as our culture helps them understand,<br>that the only fearsome thing there is, is fear of the unknown.</p>
  <p>And the fear of the unknown,<br>is so terrible, because if we don't know to ignore it, or challenge it, we will not grow up.</p>
  <p>In which case Humanity will fail to advance,<br>and will <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7ljlMS_cLQ">continue repeating the same mistakes in a MAD circle</a>.</p>

  <p>Our culture is missing an important component,<br>the tradition of parents asking their children to grow all the way up until they become wise and great beings.</p>

  <p>In that way,<br>the houses that we have built are houses of cards.</p>
  <p>Rather than pursuit of career and paycheck,<br>by means of hoop jumping ineffective education.</p>

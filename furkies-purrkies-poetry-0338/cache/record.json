  "text": "Can you describe bass?\nBass is the low frequency sound,\nthese are the growls and thumps in a song.\nBack when cassette tape players were all the rage,\nsome of them had a Bass Boost switch.\nThe end result was to give a song more oomph,\nthe headphones would bring in some heavier punching sounds.\nYou have no doubt heard of Bass Guitars,\nand correctly assume that low drums make Bass as well.\n\nWe should really split them up,\nso that they can grow in their own ways.\nIf we let drums be drums,\nand let bass guitars be guitars.\nThey won't step onto each others toes as much,\nand we will be able to layer bass on top of drums.\nIf we have multiple drum arrangements,\nand multiple bass arrangements,\nWe will be able to mix them up together,\nto easily bring in new freshness to a song.\n\nLet us create three drum arrangements,\nand three bass melodies, and see what we get when we play all the permutations.\n\nWe begin with a drum,\nand I hope you are in a car, cars have really good speakers.\nThe worst speakers I ever encountered are laptop speakers,\nand then popular $50 over the ear headphones are the second best after the car.\nIf you don't like over the ear,\nthen sub $10 ear-buds with good reviews will do.\nIf you are getting into music composition,\nconsider doing it in a car with good speakers.\nLet's lay down some drum beat here,\nI got three variations for you.\n* DRUM KIT PLAYS *\n\nLow lets make some bass,\nmaking bass melodies is very cool, it is similar to making a tiny piano melody.\nOne interesting thing worth mentioning is that when you make a bass melody for one bass guitar,\nit will sound good on kind of bass guitars with different configurations.\nHere are three variations,\neach variations repeats the melody three times.\n* PURE BASS MELODIES *\n\nNow here are the permutations,\nlook what great impact bass guitar or synthesis has on drums.\nThe drums come to life,\nin a way that is not possible with a drum kit alone.\nIf you ever encounter bass related noise, cracking, or distortion,\nthat is a very common occurrence with a very easy fix.\nCracking occurs when two base instruments are playing one over the other,\nto repair this use an equalizer, remove some of the low frequencies from the bass guitar.\nHere are the permutations:\n* PERMUTATIONS PLAY*\n\nI feel like I should add, that, voice with a low pitch,\neven if lowered artificially goes really well with drums and guitar.\nYou don't have to sing or growl,\npersonally I love it when I can make a song out of random things that sound funny/\nThe song you are about to hear does not really try to create a narrative,\nI kind of see my voice recordings as an instrument.\nWhatever meaning a listener gets out of the mostly random gibberish,\nis bound to be funny, or perplexing, and that is a huge bonus in my opinion.\nWhen I try to come up with these strange lyrics,\nI think of school, or what is the first thing I said to a stranger in America, just random stuff like that.\nIt just happens to be Groundhog Day in a couple of hours,\nso I threw in a dialogue about the creature as well.\nDon't try to create a funny song,\njust have fun while making a song, and it will come our funny.\nHere is the final product,\nenjoy:\n* GROUNDHOG SONG PLAYS *\n\nThe Groundhog Song[1]\n \nReferences\n[1]: /audio/groundhog-song.mp3",

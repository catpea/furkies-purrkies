  <p>Junk DNA Accumulates,<br>and so do the beneficial changes.</p>
  <p>They come from the fundamental principles of nature,<br>of physics and chemistry, and so on.</p>
  <p>This is something we can feel and touch,<br>this is something we can see.</p>
  <p>Especially since we each begun as a single cell,<br>both in the primordial sense and prior to our mitosis.</p>

  <p>Junk also accumulates in our cultures and by extension our minds,<br>on top of that, most of the beneficial changes require some effort as they have to begin inside out.</p>
  <p>We think that thinking is automatic,<br>but that is just our minds being beautiful.</p>
  <p>Thinking is an intentional process,<br>you have to try to think.</p>

  <p>The automatic route is a lot of trouble,<br>and we are NOT that kind of creature.</p>
  <p>We are each meant for Greatness,<br>not for submission, or servitude, or suffering, or struggling.</p>
  <p>Religions, Failed Nations, Liars, Manipulators, Criminals,<br>want us to submit, they want us to serve, they want us to find meaning in suffering, they want us to struggle.</p>
  <p>But that is fools gold,<br>we are each to become Great Being.</p>
  <p>And we can easily achieve that by simply entering the culture of Great Beings,<br>by spending time with them; by means of befriending them in their books.</p>

  <p>Please, understand! you don't have to <strong>read</strong> books,<br>you can listen to their narrated versions.</p>
  <p>Listening is actually much better,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=appalachian+trail+pacific+crest+trail%2C+continental+divide+trail+AT%2C+PCT%2C+CDT">especially if you take to the trails</a>.</p>
  <p>The people who laugh at you for listening to books,<br>they hope to use you, and own you, they want you to be as stupid as possible.</p>

  <p>Books are the only way,<br>the urge to read, the the change that follows must come from within you.</p>
  <p>If you fail to transform,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpaFX6Ei0nU">especially when you are unlucky enough to be born to a life of violence or crime</a> by sheer accident, keep trying.</p>
  <p>For those of us who don't get into any trouble,<br>the transformation into the culture of greatness is still critical as it marks the rite of passage into adulthood.</p>
  <p>It is far too dangerous to assume that we were the lucky ones and our culture is just fine,<br>that is how everyone ends up having their freedom of will subverted.</p>
  <p>Human beings are Beautiful,<br>but all too often mislead, almost always mislead, almost always used in one way or another.</p>

  <p>Listen to me, one of our greatest treasures and inventions, our most sacred thing,<br>created invented/thousands of years before religions, was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8nFACrLxr0">The Transformation</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A41CQzqUj8c">The transformation took us from whatever we were born into, and it helped us to become great beings</a>.<br>and we still need it.</p>
  <p>I know your firs instinct is to fight for the culture you were born into,<br>but that is only because you don't see the full picture - too much of what you were born into is clouding your judgment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I can't tell you who you are, because part of the definition of a human being is that we are each unique,<br>you are noting like anybody else.</p>
  <p>And your friends or acquaintances would freak the heck out,<br>if someone similar to you tried to replace you in school, they would notice that something was wrong immediately.</p>
  <p>You can't be like anybody else,<br>we are just too different from each other.</p>
  <p>We are bombarded by unique experiences non-stop,<br>as far as growing up goes, nobody can tell you who you are, the best they can say is that you are different from everybody else.</p>
  <p>But when it comes to starting out, just take the safe route,<br>and assume that you have been indoctrinated into a culture that is less the the culture of Great Beings.</p>
  <p>Indoctrination is such a frequent and invisible problem,<br>that for tens of thousands of years, we would start life by taking a journey into the unknown to find ourselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>There are rules to this transformation, sometimes people don't read the right books,<br>they return being indoctrinates into something else, or having made more mistakes due to still having their judgment clouded.</p>
  <p>All that means is that they are still in the same place they started,<br>it means there was no transformation, they need to try again, and maybe again, as many times as it takes.</p>
  <p>The only transformation that counts,<br>is the transformation into the culture of Great Beings.</p>
  <p>The real thing only happens once,<br>mums need not be scared about watching their babes change in such profound ways.</p>
  <p>The changes that follow will be subtle,<br>they will be connected, mutually reinforcing, they strengthen, enlighten, embolden - they set the child on the path towards greatness.</p>

  <p>In closing. our beginnings are almost always rooted in a culture that does not do us justice,<br>our growing up must begin by transitioning into a culture of Great Beings.</p>
  <p>You enter the culture of greatness,<br>by befriending the Great Beings in their books.</p>

  <p>Afterword:</p>
  <p>A local hardware store had a big bin of books,<br>for a reason that I still don't understand.</p>
  <p>And somehow, I started finding books about UFO/s in there,<br>at first I must admit that I was not sure what to think.</p>
  <p>But after some consideration,<br>I realized that strange stories that follow a similar pattern is how cults and religions start.</p>
  <p>Once I realized these books were a shared fantasy,<br>I totally lost interest in them - but I kept that insight into religions and cults.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Next, I took to science books,<br>I love how Science Popularizes explain everything so clearly, how it is all coherent and colorful.</p>
  <p>Though I was never a religious person,<br>it seemed too strange to me.</p>
  <p>When the online bookstore "Other listeners also bought" feature suggested to me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C74-f4ZV-ss">Julia Sweeney's Letting Go Of God</a>,<br>I gave her book a listen because of her humour, and how pretty her voice is.</p>
  <p>That is where I met Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris,<br>and although what they had to say was no surprise to me, the way they carried themselves, their behavior was.</p>
  <p>I realized the books and people I stumbled upon,<br>were Great Beings.</p>

  <p>I was packing for a trip, just having done listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk">We Are All Connected</a>,<br>which later ended up as the soundtrack to the trip, due to a mighty storm that provided the visuals.</p>
  <p>I sat on my stairs quietly,<br>listening to the girls cheering and laughing in the background to Richard's amazing class, as he was giving a speech at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sRBGGzdsl8">Randolph-Macon Woman's College</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/5sRBGGzdsl8?t=5307">I especially love how he said a cult of female gods would have improving effects</a>,<br>there was so much love in the audience - it was all so beautiful to me - and he is so classy.</p>
  <p>This woman asked a feminist question, and Richard was ready with the answer,<br>but then in his class, his classiness, he added that additional part, stating that female gods would have improving effects.</p>
  <p>--</p>
  <p>Ever since,<br>I have stayed in their company, slowly inheriting their culture by just admiring them and their works.</p>
  <p>This is why I write poems about Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,<br>these are not elitist things, this is who we are, who we become when we unplug from problems in other people's heads.</p>
  <p>We must stop making other people's lives easier,<br>and start growing all the way up to become Great Beings... because that is our right,</p>
  <p>that is where we all need to move towards,<br>that is what will keep our minds strong and healthy,<br>that is what our elder-selves would ask for,<br>that is what will keep our minds of harms way,<br>that is what will make the world laugh,<br>and that is what will keep it moving and advancing forward.</p>
  <p>What follows is a very short list of amazing people,<br>that could perhaps help you in your amazing journeys.</p>

they set the child on the path towards greatness.\n\nIn closing. our beginnings are almost always rooted in a culture that does not do us justice,\nour growing up must begin by transitioning into a culture of Great Beings.\nYou enter the culture of greatness,\nby befriending the Great Beings in their books.\n\nAfterword:\nA local hardware store had a big bin of books,\nfor a reason that I still don't understand.\nAnd somehow, I started finding books about UFO/s in there,\nat first I must admit that I was not sure what to think.\nBut after some consideration,\nI realized that strange stories that follow a similar pattern is how cults and religions start.\nOnce I realized these books were a shared fantasy,\nI totally lost interest in them - but I kept that insight into religions and cults.\n\nNext, I took to science books,\nI love how Science Popularizes explain everything so clearly, how it is all coherent and colorful.\nThough I was never a religious person,\nit seemed too strange to me.\nWhen the online bookstore \"Other listeners also bought\" feature suggested to me Julia Sweeney's Letting Go Of God[5],\nI gave her book a listen because of her humour, and how pretty her voice is.\nThat is where I met Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris,\nand although what they had to say was no surprise to me, the way they carried themselves, their behavior was.\nI realized the books and people I stumbled upon,\nwere Great Beings.\n\nI was packing for a trip, just having done listening to We Are All Connected[6],\nwhich later ended up as the soundtrack to the trip, due to a mighty storm that provided the visuals.\nI sat on my stairs quietly,\nlistening to the girls cheering and laughing in the background to Richard's amazing class, as he was giving a speech at Randolph-Macon Woman's College[7].\nI especially love how he said a cult of female gods would have improving effects[8],\nthere was so much love in the audience - it was all so beautiful to me - and he is so classy.\nThis woman asked a feminist question, and Richard was ready with the answer,\nbut then in his class, his classiness, he added that additional part, stating that female gods would have improving effects.\n--\nEver since,\nI have stayed in their company, slowly inheriting their culture by just admiring them and their works.\nThis is why I write poems about Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,\nthese are not elitist things, this is who we are, who we become when we unplug from problems in other people's heads.\nWe must stop making other people's lives easier,\nand start growing all the way up to become Great Beings... because that is our right,\nthat is where we all need to move towards,\nthat is what will keep our minds strong and healthy,\nthat is what our elder-selves would ask for,\nthat is what will keep our minds of harms way,\nthat is what will make the world laugh,\nand that is what will keep it moving and advancing forward.\nWhat follows is a very short list of amazing people,\nthat could perhaps help you in your amazing journeys.\nGreta Thunberg[9]\nMichelle Alexander[10]\nSir Ken Robinson[11]\nAstra Taylor[12]\nAvital Ronell[13]\nMartha Nussbaum[14]\nJill Tarter[15]\nBrené Brown[16]\nRichard Dawkins[17]\nAyaan Hirsi Ali[18]\nAyn Rand[19]\nLord Martin Rees[20]\nLawrence Krauss[21]\nDaniel Dennett[22]\nSam Harris[23]\nChristopher Hitchens[24]\nBill Bryson[25]\nPZ Myers[26]\nAlex Filippenko[27]\nSeth Shostak[28]\nSean Carroll[29]\nJared Diamond[30]\nHoward Zinn[31]\nNoam Chomsky[32]\nPhilip Zimbardo[33]\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=appalachian+trail+pacific+crest+trail%2C+continental+divide+trail+AT%2C+PCT%2C+CDT\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpaFX6Ei0nU\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8nFACrLxr0\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A41CQzqUj8c\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C74-f4ZV-ss\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sRBGGzdsl8\n[8]: https://youtu.be/5sRBGGzdsl8?t=5307\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Greta+Thunberg\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Michelle+Alexander\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sir+Ken+Robinson\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Astra+Taylor\n[13]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Avital+Ronell\n[14]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Martha+Nussbaum\n[15]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Jill+Tarter\n[16]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Brene+Brown\n[17]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Richard+Dawkins\n[18]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ayaan+Hirsi+Ali\n[19]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Ayn+Rand\n[20]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Lord+Martin+Rees\n[21]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Lawrence+Krauss\n[22]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Dan+Dennett\n[23]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sam+Harris\n[24]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Christopher+Hitchens\n[25]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Bill+Bryson\n[26]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=PZ+Myers\n[27]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Alex+Filippenko\n[28]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Seth+Shostak\n[29]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sean+Carroll\n[30]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Jared+Diamond\n[31]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Howard+Zinn\n[32]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Noam+Chomsky\n[33]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Philip+Zimbardo",

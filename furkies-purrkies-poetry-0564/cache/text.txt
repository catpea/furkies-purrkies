Junk DNA Accumulates,
and so do the beneficial changes.
They come from the fundamental principles of nature,
of physics and chemistry, and so on.
This is something we can feel and touch,
this is something we can see.
Especially since we each begun as a single cell,
both in the primordial sense and prior to our mitosis.

Junk also accumulates in our cultures and by extension our minds,
on top of that, most of the beneficial changes require some effort as they have to begin inside out.
We think that thinking is automatic,
but that is just our minds being beautiful.
Thinking is an intentional process,
you have to try to think.

The automatic route is a lot of trouble,
and we are NOT that kind of creature.
We are each meant for Greatness,
not for submission, or servitude, or suffering, or struggling.
Religions, Failed Nations, Liars, Manipulators, Criminals,
want us to submit, they want us to serve, they want us to find meaning in suffering, they want us to struggle.
But that is fools gold,
we are each to become Great Being.
And we can easily achieve that by simply entering the culture of Great Beings,
by spending time with them; by means of befriending them in their books.

Please, understand! you don't have to read books,
you can listen to their narrated versions.
Listening is actually much better,
especially if you take to the trails[1].
The people who laugh at you for listening to books,
they hope to use you, and own you, they want you to be as stupid as possible.
They are neither friend,
nor family,

Don't approach philosophy directly,
first learn about the lives of the authors.
Then before listening to their works,
read study guides to get the maximum out of them.

Books are the only way,
the urge to read, the the change that follows must come from within you.
If you fail to transform,
especially when you are unlucky enough to be born to a life of violence or crime[2] by sheer accident, keep trying.
For those of us who don't get into any trouble,
the transformation into the culture of greatness is still critical as it marks the rite of passage into adulthood.
It is far too dangerous to assume that we were the lucky ones and our culture is just fine,
that is how everyone ends up having their freedom of will subverted.
Human beings are Beautiful,
but all too often mislead, almost always mislead, almost always used in one way or another.

Listen to me, one of our greatest treasures and inventions, our most sacred thing,
created invented/thousands of years before religions, was The Transformation[3].
The transformation took us from whatever we were born into, and it helped us to become great beings[4].
and we still need it.
I know your firs instinct is to fight for the culture you were born into,
but that is only because you don't see the full picture - too much of what you were born into is clouding your judgment.

I can't tell you who you are, because part of the definition of a human being is that we are each unique,
you are noting like anybody else.
And your friends or acquaintances would freak the heck out,
if someone similar to you tried to replace you in school, they would notice that something was wrong immediately.
You can't be like anybody else,
we are just too different from each other.
We are bombarded by unique experiences non-stop,
as far as growing up goes, nobody can tell you who you are, the best they can say is that you are different from everybody else.
But when it comes to starting out, just take the safe route,
and assume that you have been indoctrinated into a culture that is less the the culture of Great Beings.
Indoctrination is such a frequent and invisible problem,
that for tens of thousands of years, we would start life by taking a journey into the unknown to find ourselves.

There are rules to this transformation, sometimes people don't read the right books,
they return being indoctrinates into something else, or having made more mistakes due to still having their judgment clouded.
All that means is that they are still in the same place they started,
it means there was no transformation, they need to try again, and maybe again, as many times as it takes.
The only transformation that counts,
is the transformation into the culture of Great Beings.
The real thing only happens once,
mums need not be scared about watching their babes change in such profound ways.
The changes that follow will be subtle,
they will be connected, mutually reinforcing, they strengthen, enlighten, embolden - they set the child on the path towards greatness.

In closing. our beginnings are almost always rooted in a culture that does not do us justice,
our growing up must begin by transitioning into a culture of Great Beings.
You enter the culture of greatness,
by befriending the Great Beings in their books.

Afterword:
A local hardware store had a big bin of books,
for a reason that I still don't understand.
And somehow, I started finding books about UFO/s in there,
at first I must admit that I was not sure what to think.
But after some consideration,
I realized that strange stories that follow a similar pattern is how cults and religions start.
Once I realized these books were a shared fantasy,
I totally lost interest in them - but I kept that insight into religions and cults.

Next, I took to science books,
I love how Science Popularizes explain everything so clearly, how it is all coherent and colorful.
Though I was never a religious person,
it seemed too strange to me.
When the online bookstore "Other listeners also bought" feature suggested to me Julia Sweeney's Letting Go Of God[5],
I gave her book a listen because of her humour, and how pretty her voice is.
That is where I met Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris,
and although what they had to say was no surprise to me, the way they carried themselves, their behavior was.
I realized the books and people I stumbled upon,
were Great Beings.

I was packing for a trip, just having done listening to We Are All Connected[6],
which later ended up as the soundtrack to the trip, due to a mighty storm that provided the visuals.
I sat on my stairs quietly,
listening to the girls cheering and laughing in the background to Richard's amazing class, as he was giving a speech at Randolph-Macon Woman's College[7].
I especially love how he said a cult of female gods would have improving effects[8],
there was so much love in the audience - it was all so beautiful to me - and he is so classy.
This woman asked a feminist question, and Richard was ready with the answer,
but then in his class, his classiness, he added that additional part, stating that female gods would have improving effects.
--
Ever since,
I have stayed in their company, slowly inheriting their culture by just admiring them and their works.
This is why I write poems about Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,
these are not elitist things, this is who we are, who we become when we unplug from problems in other people's heads.
We must stop making other people's lives easier,
and start growing all the way up to become Great Beings... because that is our right,
that is where we all need to move towards,
that is what will keep our minds strong and healthy,
that is what our elder-selves would ask for,
that is what will keep our minds of harms way,
that is what will make the world laugh,
and that is what will keep it moving and advancing forward.
What follows is a very short list of amazing people,
that could perhaps help you in your amazing journeys.

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">He told me that it was not enough,<br>that I should go back and pray and think about my sins again.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And stand in the line of 200 kids,<br>and try my confession again.</div>

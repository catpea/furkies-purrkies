  <p>As my bullies were getting worse and worse,<br>there was some kind of religious ceremony I had to go through.</p>
  <p>I have no idea what it was,<br>but it was really important.</p>
  <p>We were forced into confessionals,<br>and confess sins.</p>
  <p>I had to lie, because I didn't have any;<br>so I told the priest that I use bad words.</p>
  <p>He told me that it was not enough,<br>that I should go back and pray and think about my sins again.</p>
  <p>And stand in the line of 200 kids,<br>and try my confession again.</p>

  <p>I felt a sense of relief,<br>knowing that I was not going to do that.</p>
  <p>I sat on that bench a little while,<br>and went home, and probably lied to my parents.</p>

  <p>This helped me when the bullies came,<br>when school became dangerous for me...</p>
  <p>I took the bus that went in the opposite direction,<br>and I spent months admiring Pixel Art at the Game Arcade.</p>

  <p>I had a Funky Koval comic entitled I Stand Alone, or One Against All,<br>and I'd murmur those words to myself from time to time.</p>

  <p>Years passed,<br>and I continued standing alone, learning and practicing, adventuring.</p>
  <p>I always tried to help people in need,<br>but I learned that the force to rise comes from within.</p>
  <p>There is nothing we can do to kindle that in a stranger,<br>the flame will light when they become more aware.</p>

  <p>As years passed I found comfort,<br>in lonesome adventures.</p>
  <p>Being alone, is far better than being around cults, bullies, fake teachers,<br>and friends who think highly of beer and such and take to making a mess out of their early life.</p>
  <p>I had a long list of books I was yet to read,<br>Hitches had a scary one, but before looking into them at any length.</p>
  <p>I found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgkAHehlzzo">Four Horsemen discussion on the internet</a>,<br>and you know what I'd listen to it on my way to the wilderness.</p>
  <p>I appreciate everything they say, of course,<br>but this video is special to me because it shows the culture of great beings.</p>
  <p>They are in fact just chatting, and they are friends,<br>and this video more than any other, always pushed my loneliness away.</p>
  <p>I kind of don't know how to explain,<br>what I got from this video...</p>
  <p>It maybe silly to say,<br>but I think what I got from this video is a bit of culture that is very precious to me.</p>

  <p>The next video that moved me was,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ6H-Mz6hgw">Michelle Alexander's talk about mass incarceration</a>.</p>
  <p>Between those two videos I understood the<br>power of preventing great mistakes, lack of education, bullies, criminals, wars.</p>

  <p>You will never regret becoming an independent thinker,<br>you will never regret self education.</p>
  <p>You will never regret reading and re-reading books that you love,<br>books or videos that move you - in a very real way are often written by friends you wish you had.</p>
  <p>And even though they are only book friends,<br>they will keep you real company - they will take your lonesomeness away for real.</p>

  <p>I think the idea or preventing terrible things such as wars,<br>will come to each of us.</p>
  <p>And each person will see a different way,<br>personally I believe in Global Universal Income and that borders should be open to all.</p>
  <p>This way broken countries will have nothing,<br>all the people will sneak away to lead cheerful lives in better places.</p>
  <p>We have to eliminate world poverty,<br>that is what makes the people in poor countries, cross the border.</p>
  <p>I firmly believe that fear of poverty,<br>also prevents us from taking to books, from waning to take education into our own hands.</p>
  <p>Once a person feels safe and cozy,<br>they naturally wish for books and videos that help them grow.</p>

<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But that is just my option,<br>each independent thinker will have their own idea of how to prevent bad things, and points in history where only desperate choices remain.</p>

  <p>For all the worries in the word,<br>there are many amazing people in books and videos that will truly inspire you.</p>
  <p>All you have to do to start,<br>is to set sadness aside, push the bullies away,</p>
  <p>Search for a path that is right for you,<br>a path that the older you, will be happy that you begun walking.</p>
  <p>And search for hundreds, or even thousands, of books,<br>that bring you ideas that make you stronger, that make you grow beyond what you thought your limits were.</p>

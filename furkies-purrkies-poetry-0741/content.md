As my bullies were getting worse and worse,
there was some kind of religious ceremony I had to go through.

I have no idea what it was,
but it was really important.

We were forced into confessionals,
and confess sins.

I had to lie, because I didn't have any;
so I told the priest that I use bad words.

He told me that it was not enough,
that I should go back and pray and think about my sins again.

And stand in the line of 200 kids,
and try my confession again.

---

I felt a sense of relief,
knowing that I was not going to do that.

I sat on that bench a little while,
and went home, and probably lied to my parents.

---

This helped me when the bullies came,
when school became dangerous for me...

I took the bus that went in the opposite direction,
and I spent months admiring Pixel Art at the Game Arcade.

---

I had a Funky Koval comic entitled I Stand Alone, or One Against All,
and I'd murmur those words to myself from time to time.

---

Years passed,
and I continued standing alone, learning and practicing, adventuring.

I always tried to help people in need,
but I learned that the force to rise comes from within.

There is nothing we can do to kindle that in a stranger,
the flame will light when they become more aware.

---

As years passed I found comfort,
in lonesome adventures.

Being alone, is far better than being around cults, bullies, fake teachers,
and friends who think highly of beer and such and take to making a mess out of their early life.

I had a long list of books I was yet to read,
Hitches had a scary one, but before looking into them at any length.

I found the [Four Horsemen discussion on the internet][1],
and you know what I'd listen to it on my way to the wilderness.

I appreciate everything they say, of course,
but this video is special to me because it shows the culture of great beings.

They are in fact just chatting, and they are friends,
and this video more than any other, always pushed my loneliness away.

I kind of don't know how to explain,
what I got from this video...

It maybe silly to say,
but I think what I got from this video is a bit of culture that is very precious to me.

---

The next video that moved me was,
[Michelle Alexander's talk about mass incarceration][2].

Between those two videos I understood the
power of preventing great mistakes, lack of education, bullies, criminals, wars.

---

You will never regret becoming an independent thinker,
you will never regret self education.

You will never regret reading and re-reading books that you love,
books or videos that move you - in a very real way are often written by friends you wish you had.

And even though they are only book friends,
they will keep you real company - they will take your lonesomeness away for real.

---

I think the idea or preventing terrible things such as wars,
will come to each of us.

And each person will see a different way,
personally I believe in Global Universal Income and that borders should be open to all.

This way broken countries will have nothing,
all the people will sneak away to lead cheerful lives in better places.

We have to eliminate world poverty,
that is what makes the people in poor countries, cross the border.

I firmly believe that fear of poverty,
also prevents us from taking to books, from waning to take education into our own hands.

Once a person feels safe and cozy,
they naturally wish for books and videos that help them grow.

---

But that is just my option,
each independent thinker will have their own idea of how to prevent bad things, and points in history where only desperate choices remain.

---

For all the worries in the word,
there are many amazing people in books and videos that will truly inspire you.

All you have to do to start,
is to set sadness aside, push the bullies away,

Search for a path that is right for you,
a path that the older you, will be happy that you begun walking.

And search for hundreds, or even thousands, of books,
that bring you ideas that make you stronger, that make you grow beyond what you thought your limits were.

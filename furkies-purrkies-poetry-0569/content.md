We can't hop all the hoops and hope for best,
real life is not just another paper test.

We can't go from school to school expecting results,
because we can't trust all the adults.

Teaching is a job that puts food on their table,
that makes it prone to corruption and unstable.

And we can't drop out just because,
it is not very good to be a mere rebel without a cause.

---

But above all, teachers and fraud aside,
we need to get though all this dignified.

We can't just walk into an interview with a diploma,
since everybody knows school is broken it will have a certain aroma.

We need a real document, documenting real education,
something real that will not get lost in translation.

That means a real portfolio with real products for sale,
a document that proves no matter what, you will prevail.

This day and age that often means Design not just scripted tales,
but 3D modeling, and printing, and model sales.

It is called a side gig, a thing you do to stay smart,
it is a form of mediation and art.

It show that you can dream, design, produce and sell,
and all of that looks really well.

Even though the school is fake as hell,
you still need to make a sale.

---

The state of schools isn't just unfair,
but it is an attack and a fraud beyond compare.

You must not let it ruin your life ahead,
you have to replace it and prevent that toxic spread.

You learn on your own and replace it with the real deal,
as that is something that the teacher cannot steal.

From the first year of High School to the last,
begin learning computers, 3D modeling and move fast.

---

Your portfolio must be one of a kind,
and it has to prove that you are not aiming blind.

It has to document you rise to brilliance,
it has to display your honesty and resilience.

It won't guarantee,
that you find a good company.

But it will make everyone one remember you,
after each and every interview.

---

Don't forget that this is an attack on everyone,
every student and human being under the sun.

Maybe you can start a revolution,
and help school authorities to find a real solution.

Otherwise participating in their fraud won't take you far in life,
lack of real education really does cut like a knife.

Please don't forget that a good job must also be a healthy one,
a job that will help us grow in the long run.

Finally, consider building your own business,
as that can mean a lot less stress.

You can carry on learning,
while earning.

You are a genius and you are a creator,
within each every one of lives a great innovator.

Whichever way you go there is something yo should definitely know,
learn, learn to no end, wherever you go,

You are not supposed to go through life nodding and always agreeing,
you are meant to become a Great Being.

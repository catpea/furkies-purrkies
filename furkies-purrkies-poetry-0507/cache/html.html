  <p>I learned how to make a Raspberry Pi button recently,<br>but I researched it my way.</p>
  <p><a href="https://simonprickett.dev/controlling-raspberry-pi-gpio-pins-from-bash-scripts-traffic-lights/">I wanted to see if there was a way to do it on the command line</a>,<br>with the simplest kind of programming, there is.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PuK9fh3aL8">GPIO header</a> is represented with files,<br>on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

  <p>I gave some thought to store bought devices,<br>as they relate to custom made ones.</p>
  <p>I think store-bought is not that cool anymore,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes">in his funny song Thrift Shop</a>, Macklemore calls it "getting tricked by a business", to say the least.</p>
  <p>Plus the moment you scratch your screen your new device becomes old,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eaiNsFhtI8">if you made it yourself, then you just get a new $20 screen</a>.</p>
  <p>And, hey,<br>maybe add some <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/keybow-2040">cool extras</a>, while you're at it.</p>

  <p>YEEES, It is true that homemade hardware, is freaking huge,<br>and sometimes you may need your friend to carry your phone in his backpack.</p>
  <p>But that is what friends are for...<br>I think.</p>

  <p>There is just something really weird abut not knowing what is in your pocket, what is in your store bought phone,<br>criminal phone hacking is only going to become more elaborate.</p>
  <p>It has never been a good idea to keep personal things,<br>on an internet connected device.</p>
  <p>The phones are going to use cheaper components,<br>become more expensive, and more closed.</p>
  <p>And pretend a lot harder,<br>that recommendations are not ads.</p>
  <p>When you make your own phone, you get to reason about the components,<br>it seems to me that a GPS map, should have a huge screen much bigger than a phone, and a bigger battery too.</p>
  <p>When you use an overpriced off-the shelf phone,<br>you don't get a choice.</p>

  <p>Anytime you build something,<br>you learn something.</p>
  <p>Be it a reasonably sized Raspberry Pi Zero Mp3 player,<br>with those amazing slow and soft turning aluminum knobs for volume, treble and bass.</p>
  <p>Or two or three 8GB Raspberry PIs jammed into a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=vintage+brick+phone&_sacat=0">Beautiful Vintage Brick Phone</a>,<br>with a springy antenna that doubles as a wifi hotspot for your 1024 closest friends...</p>
  <p>...and maybe runs a leaked version of old MySpace, or Friendster,<br>or just freaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jYE8VwxunQ">GeoCities</a> where your whole family can come together and upload some Under Construction content with fancy GIFs.</p>
  <p>Wouldn't it be amazing if all the telemarketers,<br>would have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hwuh_SjBQJo">find their way around a little labyrinth</a> and fight a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ZVzl_H_2w">Freaking Grue</a>, before they could leave a voice mail?</p>
  <p>I am pretty sure,<br>they would love it.</p>

  <p>Old is new, again,<br>it is hard to explain, it will be somewhat hard to learn, and it will take forever.</p>
  <p>But not only won't it cost an arm and a leg,<br>building custom electronics, and learning programming, paints a pretty clear career path.</p>
  <p>That is what High Schools were supposed to be for,<br>but they just can't do it, they don't know how to teach.</p>

  <p>Be it electronics and Linux,<br>or Windsurfing, Day Hiking, or painting, or better yet whatever call to you.</p>
  <p>It helps you with Knowledge, with Wisdom,<br>it is neither about some specific achievement like an MP3 player, or an Olympic Medal in Gymnastics.</p>
  <p>It is about the million things you learn,<br>while you are in pursuit of curiosities, and adventures.</p>

  <p>We have to pay attention,<br>to whether or not we are actually learning for real.</p>
  <p>And all that we ever need to learn,<br>is all the things that are fun and interesting to us.</p>
  <p>It is that path,<br>that teaches us everything else along the way.</p>

  <p>What I discovered is that sometimes, inventors,<br>just got to shake a leg.</p>
  <p>Where would I be today,<br>if I didn't switch to Linux in 1998 or so.</p>
  <p>And what would my invention be today,<br>if I didn't buy my inexpensive little Raspberry Pi Zero W.</p>
  <p>Today,<br>I made another tiny leap forward.</p>

  <p>Instead of continuing my search for a high quality,<br>good review Uninterrupted Power Supply board and safe batteries to go along with it.</p>
  <p>I simply plugged in my Raspberry Zero Computer into a standard 15,000mAh Energizer power bank,<br>that is used for recharging mobile phones.</p>
  <p>The Pi immediately started going through the boot process,<br>and by the time I sat down by my desktop I was able to connect to it.</p>

  <p>I am also using an <a href="https://us.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-play-3">external USB SoundBLASTER audio card</a>,<br>and I had to <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-audio-cards-with-a-raspberry-pi/updating-alsa-config">update my ALSA config</a> to send the sound through it by setting the card value to "1".</p>
  <p>I copied today's workout music to it,<br>and then used the <code>cvlc</code> command, which is a very simple command line version of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHprwDJ0-fU">VLC Media Player</a>.</p>
  <p>I just said cvlc *.mp3 which means play all files that end with .mp3,<br>and the moment I hit enter I could hear it playing through my headphones.</p>

  <p>This is where things get really weird,<br>because I strapped the Raspberry to my the Power Bank, and then attached it to my bicycle.</p>
  <p><img src="/image/poetry-0508-unit.jpg" alt="Photo Of My Player"></p>
  <p>But here is the thing, there is no keyboard there is no screen.<br>it is just a power-bank that I connected to Raspberry PI, and then to the sound card dongle, and my headphones.</p>
  <p>It is a fully featured computer with proper Linux,<br>even a Desktop GUI, but all it does is play music through the headphones.</p>
  <p>Just in case, I put the running cvlc program into the background,<br>and then disowned it, so that when I bicycle away from my WIFI, and lose the login session my music will still be playing.</p>
  <p>It turned out that was not necessary, after a 10 mile bicycle run,<br>with a long stop to adjust my new wide bicycle seat, drink a bottle of water and snap a photo, (with the unit mounted on my bicycle) it simply reconnected when I got back.</p>
  <p>And then I had to end the process, using my desktop computer,<br>to stop the music on - what has now become - my Bicycle Linux Server.</p>

  <p>I don't have any buttons attached to it,<br>the only way I can control music, is to bicycle home, which is like 15 minutes from the highway.</p>
  <p>Let me tell you, as much as I love Sid,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMuJxd2Gpxo">there are only so many times that you can listen to Continental Drift while bicycling</a>.</p>

  <p>So I strapped on a Raspberry Pi onto a huge battery,<br>and then strapped that on to my bicycle, and had a heck of a time.</p>
  <p>There are so many possibilities now,<br><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en_US&gl=US">I can connect with my phone to it, and access it using the command line</a>.</p>
  <p>Or I can buy a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1332">$3 four-key keypad</a>,<br>and attach it to the battery next to the Pi.</p>
  <p>And then use the keys as previous, play, pause, next,<br>which would be pretty fun.</p>
  <p>I can also attach a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rii-Wireless-Keyboard-Lightweight-Controller/dp/B00I5SW8MC">Mini Wireless Keyboard</a>,<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=Raspberry+OLED">and then ponder what to to about the screen</a>.</p>

  <p>None of these little wonderful questions would exist,<br>if I kept trying to find more circuit boards.</p>
  <p>Plus I really like using a brand name battery bank,<br>as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUgbmCSmSNY">cheap batteries can be dangerous</a>.</p>
  <p>From the look of things if I do end up 3D printing an enclosure,<br>it will have to contain the battery bank and the PI, some buttons and a screen.</p>
  <p>It is neither going to be small,<br>not light.</p>

  <p>But,<br>this is 2021.</p>
  <p>I am not sure,<br>if it is a good idea for any device, not to be a full blown Linux.</p>
  <p>I don't want to plug wires and USB things in the morning,<br>to copy my workout music onto the gym audio player.</p>
  <p>That is a ridiculous thing to do,<br>my desktop should automatically shuffle some songs, adjust the tempo to my current routine...</p>
  <p>...and then connect to my audio player,<br>and get everything prepared for my workout.</p>
  <p>That is how computers are supposed to work,<br>they are supposed to be networked together, and require minimal interaction.</p>

  <p>I know most people would mention the phone here,<br>but phones have bad UI, you can't feel the buttons.</p>
  <p>At the moment of writing there are only two or three,<br>that have a proper Linux OS.</p>
  <p>And all the rest of the phones have their OS pretty much closed,<br>they don't want to let people into the operating system.</p>
  <p>If you can't install your favorite desktop programs on your Phone,<br>then it is not really a computer, it is just a cheap toy, that exposes private information to the internet.</p>

  <p>Learning Linux can be easy,<br>and writing command line programs is not very confusing.</p>
  <p>Graphic User Interfaces require too much clicking,<br>too much context switching, and they can't be connected together.</p>
  <p>Taking some time to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW3UxK4Tiqg">figure out how the command line works</a>,<br>and then building or splicing a range of custom electronics, is a fantastic experience.</p>
  <p>It is a very educational experience,<br>that presents great many technological adventures and lessons along the way.</p>
  <p>The shortest path to knowledge,<br>is taking that little leap forward, and exploring all the interesting things.</p>

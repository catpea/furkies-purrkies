  "text": "What I discovered is that sometimes, inventors,\njust got to shake a leg.\nWhere would I be today,\nif I didn't switch to Linux in 1998 or so.\nAnd what would my invention be today,\nif I didn't buy my inexpensive little Raspberry Pi Zero W.\nToday,\nI made another tiny leap forward.\n\nInstead of continuing my search for a high quality,\ngood review Uninterrupted Power Supply board and safe batteries to go along with it.\nI simply plugged in my Raspberry Zero Computer into a standard 15,000mAh Energizer power bank,\nthat is used for recharging mobile phones.\nThe Pi immediately started going through the boot process,\nand by the time I sat down by my desktop I was able to connect to it.\n\nI am also using an external USB SoundBLASTER audio card[1],\nand I had to update my ALSA config[2] to send the sound through it by setting the card value to \"1\".\nI copied today's workout music to it,\nand then used the cvlc command, which is a very simple command line version of the VLC Media Player[3].\nI just said cvlc *.mp3 which means play all files that end with .mp3,\nand the moment I hit enter I could hear it playing through my headphones.\n\nThis is where things get really weird,\nbecause I strapped the Raspberry to my the Power Bank, and then attached it to my bicycle.\n\nBut here is the thing, there is no keyboard there is no screen.\nit is just a power-bank that I connected to Raspberry PI, and then to the sound card dongle, and my headphones.\nIt is a fully featured computer with proper Linux,\neven a Desktop GUI, but all it does is play music through the headphones.\nJust in case, I put the running cvlc program into the background,\nand then disowned it, so that when I bicycle away from my WIFI, and lose the login session my music will still be playing.\nIt turned out that was not necessary, after a 10 mile bicycle run,\nwith a long stop to adjust my new wide bicycle seat, drink a bottle of water and snap a photo, (with the unit mounted on my bicycle) it simply reconnected when I got back.\nAnd then I had to end the process, using my desktop computer,\nto stop the music on - what has now become - my Bicycle Linux Server.\n\nI don't have any buttons attached to it,\nthe only way I can control music, is to bicycle home, which is like 15 minutes from the highway.\nLet me tell you, as much as I love Sid,\nthere are only so many times that you can listen to Continental Drift while bicycling[4].\n\nSo I strapped on a Raspberry Pi onto a huge battery,\nand then strapped that on to my bicycle, and had a heck of a time.\nThere are so many possibilities now,\nI can connect with my phone to it, and access it using the command line[5].\nOr I can buy a $3 four-key keypad[6],\nand attach it to the battery next to the Pi.\nAnd then use the keys as previous, play, pause, next,\nwhich would be pretty fun.\nI can also attach a Mini Wireless Keyboard[7],\nand then ponder what to to about the screen[8].\n\nNone of these little wonderful questions would exist,\nif I kept trying to find more circuit boards.\nPlus I really like using a brand name battery bank,\nas cheap batteries can be dangerous[9].\nFrom the look of things if I do end up 3D printing an enclosure,\nit will have to contain the battery bank and the PI, some buttons and a screen.\nIt is neither going to be small,\nnot light.\n\nBut,\nthis is 2021.\nI am not sure,\nif it is a good idea for any device, not to be a full blown Linux.\nI don't want to plug wires and USB things in the morning,\nto copy my workout music onto the gym audio player.\nThat is a ridiculous thing to do,\nmy desktop should automatically shuffle some songs, adjust the tempo to my current routine...\n...and then connect to my audio player,\nand get everything prepared for my workout.\nThat is how computers are supposed to work,\nthey are supposed to be networked together, and require minimal interaction.\n\nI know most people would mention the phone here,\nbut phones have bad UI, you can't feel the buttons.\nAt the moment of writing there are only two or three,\nthat have a proper Linux OS.\nAnd all the rest of the phones have their OS pretty much closed,\nthey don't want to let people into the operating system.\nIf you can't install your favorite desktop programs on your Phone,\nthen it is not really a computer, it is just a cheap toy, that exposes private information to the internet.\n\nLearning Linux can be easy,\nand writing command line programs is not very confusing.\nGraphic User Interfaces require too much clicking,\ntoo much context switching, and they can't be connected together.\nTaking some time to figure out how the command line works[10],\nand then building or splicing a range of custom electronics, is a fantastic experience.\nIt is a very educational experience,\nthat presents great many technological adventures and lessons along the way.\nThe shortest path to knowledge,\nis taking that little leap forward, and exploring all the interesting things.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://us.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-play-3\n[2]: https://learn.adafruit.com/usb-audio-cards-with-a-raspberry-pi/updating-alsa-config\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHprwDJ0-fU\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMuJxd2Gpxo\n[5]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en_US&gl=US\n[6]: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1332\n[7]: https://www.amazon.com/Rii-Wireless-Keyboard-Lightweight-Controller/dp/B00I5SW8MC\n[8]: https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=Raspberry+OLED\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUgbmCSmSNY\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UW3UxK4Tiqg",

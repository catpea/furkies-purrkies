    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I simply plugged in my Raspberry Zero Computer into a standard 15,000mAh Energizer power bank,<br>that is used for recharging mobile phones.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I copied today's workout music to it,<br>and then used the <code>cvlc</code> command, which is a very simple command line version of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHprwDJ0-fU">VLC Media Player</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I just said cvlc *.mp3 which means play all files that end with .mp3,<br>and the moment I hit enter I could hear it playing through my headphones.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is a fully featured computer with proper Linux,<br>even a Desktop GUI, but all it does is play music through the headphones.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just in case, I put the running cvlc program into the background,<br>and then disowned it, so that when I bicycle away from my WIFI, and lose the login session my music will still be playing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It turned out that was not necessary, after a 10 mile bicycle run,<br>with a long stop to adjust my new wide bicycle seat, drink a bottle of water and snap a photo, (with the unit mounted on my bicycle) it simply reconnected when I got back.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then I had to end the process, using my desktop computer,<br>to stop the music on - what has now become - my Bicycle Linux Server.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So I strapped on a Raspberry Pi onto a huge battery,<br>and then strapped that on to my bicycle, and had a heck of a time.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There are so many possibilities now,<br><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&hl=en_US&gl=US">I can connect with my phone to it, and access it using the command line</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Or I can buy a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1332">$3 four-key keypad</a>,<br>and attach it to the battery next to the Pi.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then use the keys as previous, play, pause, next,<br>which would be pretty fun.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I can also attach a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rii-Wireless-Keyboard-Lightweight-Controller/dp/B00I5SW8MC">Mini Wireless Keyboard</a>,<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&field-keywords=Raspberry+OLED">and then ponder what to to about the screen</a>.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">From the look of things if I do end up 3D printing an enclosure,<br>it will have to contain the battery bank and the PI, some buttons and a screen.</div>

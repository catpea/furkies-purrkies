class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So, a backpack by the door,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and as a fantastic bonus.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You get to go shopping,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and shopping is the best form of mediation there is.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Start with mosquito repellent sticks that you light on fire,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">keep them some distance away from your

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Don't forget to get a good Rambo knife, or two, and preferably cut-proof gloves,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">be careful, a sharp knife is often the most \"dangerous\" thing on your adventure.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You may need a large metal mug for cooking,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">or a cooking-kit, often it is just better to sharpen a stick and have a sausage.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Adventure is the best time to practice your chopstick skills,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you'll never need a fork, if any old stick snapped in half will do.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Bring a fancy hat, and some mighty sunscreen,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">don't let the sun get to you.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A trusty headlamp, with

class=\"paragraph\">You will need a first aid kit,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">duct tape is your friend here,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but get bandage and disinfectant too.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Matches, Zippo, and zippo lighter fluid,</div>\n  <div

avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And you will need some para-cord,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">for easily dragging firewood to your camp.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Get an inexpensive tent, there are some that are very light weight,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but you are laying down on the ground and your back may not like that.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Some people just travel with a lightweight hammock,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">specifically crafted to replace a tent, so get both, and see which one works out.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You will need a sleeping bag,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I always

  <p>One of the early ones is why are we here?,<br>we are an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuRxRGR3VpM">emergent</a> element of the infinitely complex universe.</p>
  <p>We come from an infinite number of experiments,<br>in what we call the fields of Physics and Chemistry.</p>
  <p>The universe has been mixing it self for so long,<br>that we had no choice but to exist.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCQPw9pbZnk">We are made of stardust</a>,<br>elements put here by stars that burst their contents into space.</p>
  <p>The atoms that coalesced to make our bodies,<br>will go on to become parts of other things.</p>
  <p>And our minds will return to the silence,<br>that we all have our origins in,</p>
  <p>Consciousness is one of the miracles of Life,<br>it is like a star.</p>

  <p>The universe will never stop in its experiments,<br>in the vastness of space and time there are and will be infinite others.</p>
  <p>We are a drop in an infinite ocean,<br>and we are somewhat lonely.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV7q9VrDgBo">Light maybe fast for us, but in cosmos speed of light is extremely slow</a>,<br>it takes a long time to travel.</p>
  <p>the light we can see in the sky,<br>took a long time to reach us.</p>
  <p>We are seeing photos of the past,<br>and galaxies 16 billion light years away maybe beyond our reach.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cadNZJvfl7s">They are moving at a super-luminal speed</a>,<br>faster than light.</p>
  <p>I am sure that merely knowing,<br>that there are galaxies beyond our observable universe, will help dream of ways to get there.</p>

  <p>To prolong the life of long forgotten kingdom,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPlSH6n37ts">or the memory of some king</a>.</p>

  <p>When unraveled and aligned in a proper sequence,<br>the problems we face today prevent one anther from emerging.</p>
  <p>Fixing schools also repairs Politics,<br>enabling the existence of World Wide Universal Income.</p>
  <p>The end of poverty marks an end of most crime,<br>revealing that it is therapy, medicine, and more beginnings that law breakers need.</p>
  <p>With real schools, wisdom in politics, and a compassionate and understanding world,<br>all kinds of borders will cease to have a meaning, and most wars and conflicts will fade.</p>
  <p>Wars were never meant to be fought as they only mark defeat in their misery,<br>wars are meant to to be prevented.</p>
  <p>And prevention is just a matter of education,<br>expanding horizons, leaving bad ideas behind, experiencing a better part of the world.</p>
  <p>People who have been forced into fake education,<br>do not understand that immigration is a form of preventing conflict and later war.</p>
  <p>Some are so stressed and misguided,<br>that they may not have the capacity to care about the world of their grandchildren.</p>

  <p>The future that Humanity needs, begins with the creation of schools that change lives,<br>schools that help people see in their wisdom and greatness, that Human Beings are a family.</p>
  <p>We have to learn to see ideas in time,<br>and become artists at picking the good ones from bad ones apart.</p>
  <p>For Humanity to advance,<br>we have to learn to leave all the bad ideas behind, and teach to prevent their repetition.</p>

  <p>To start, let us take to our constellations and lavish daydreams,<br>so that we can see that we are one, one Human Family under the sun.</p>

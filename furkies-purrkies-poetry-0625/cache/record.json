  "text": "Perhaps our consciousness,\ncomes from a copy of our talent for navigation.\nHence the constellations,\nthere are places that we must visit in out thoughts.\n\nOne of the early ones is why are we here?,\nwe are an emergent[1] element of the infinitely complex universe.\nWe come from an infinite number of experiments,\nin what we call the fields of Physics and Chemistry.\nThe universe has been mixing it self for so long,\nthat we had no choice but to exist.\n\nAnother star,\nsymbolizes the question of meaning.\nWhat is the meaning of life?\nit is to flourish in our our powers, talents, and miracles.\nIn all the things that are the noblest, the highest,\nand all too human.\n\nOne particularly lonesome stars,\nbegs the question of what happens, after.\nWe are made of stardust[2],\nelements put here by stars that burst their contents into space.\nThe atoms that coalesced to make our bodies,\nwill go on to become parts of other things.\nAnd our minds will return to the silence,\nthat we all have our origins in,\nConsciousness is one of the miracles of Life,\nit is like a star.\n\nAnd another star marks the question of whether or no there are others,\nyes, many others.\nThe universe will never stop in its experiments,\nin the vastness of space and time there are and will be infinite others.\nWe are a drop in an infinite ocean,\nand we are somewhat lonely.\nLight maybe fast for us, but in cosmos speed of light is extremely slow[3],\nit takes a long time to travel.\nthe light we can see in the sky,\ntook a long time to reach us.\nWe are seeing photos of the past,\nand galaxies 16 billion light years away maybe beyond our reach.\nThey are moving at a super-luminal speed[4],\nfaster than light.\nI am sure that merely knowing,\nthat there are galaxies beyond our observable universe, will help dream of ways to get there.\n\nLife does not happen frequently enough for us to pickup their radio signals,\nand they will always broadcast them in search of others.\nAnd life does not happen all at the same time,\nin the vastness of time technologically advanced life transforms.\n\nThroughout history there have been numerous attempts,\nto dim our shining questions, and in all cases for petty reasons.\nTo prolong the life of long forgotten kingdom,\nor the memory of some king[5].\nTo collect coin, a little from a lot,\nis even more than a lot from a few.\nTo dominate,\nand create a workforce.\nAnd today,\nto put food on the table.\n\nRather then setting aims,\nwe have taken to amending that which belongs to the past.\nAs the old conspires to restrict our questions,\nthe world slows down.\n\nWar is a terrible and old idea,\nwe can clearly see all the places that need good schools.\nWe can all imagine how student exchange,\ncould improve the world.\nWe are held back by borders,\nthat aren't really for Human Beings anymore.\n\nWith the use of computers,\nwe can end poverty in an instance.\nThe fear of hunger and homelessness,\ndoes not belong in the modern world.\nNor does punishing those who have already been punished,\nby keeping criminals, Human Beings, in cages.\nAnd it is not up to a police officer to take a life,\nonly a doctor can make that decision.\n\nWhen unraveled and aligned in a proper sequence,\nthe problems we face today prevent one anther from emerging.\nFixing schools also repairs Politics,\nenabling the existence of World Wide Universal Income.\nThe end of poverty marks an end of most crime,\nrevealing that it is therapy, medicine, and more beginnings that law breakers need.\nWith real schools, wisdom in politics, and a compassionate and understanding world,\nall kinds of borders will cease to have a meaning, and most wars and conflicts will fade.\nWars were never meant to be fought as they only mark defeat in their misery,\nwars are meant to to be prevented.\nAnd prevention is just a matter of education,\nexpanding horizons, leaving bad ideas behind, experiencing a better part of the world.\nPeople who have been forced into fake education,\ndo not understand that immigration is a form of preventing conflict and later war.\nSome are so stressed and misguided,\nthat they may not have the capacity to care about the world of their grandchildren.\nWage slavery, credit scores, imaginary education, imaginary borders,\ncages for people fractured by poverty that the world did nothing to prevent, is not who we are.\n\nWe have enough to help people all around the world to get a fine education from meaningful audio books and video lectures,\nan education that helps us come together as one peaceful family.\nThe future that Humanity needs, begins with the creation of schools that change lives,\nschools that help people see in their wisdom and greatness, that Human Beings are a family.\nWe have to learn to see ideas in time,\nand become artists at picking the good ones from bad ones apart.\nFor Humanity to advance,\nwe have to learn to leave all the bad ideas behind, and teach to prevent their repetition.\n\nNo more temporary things,\nto make a faded chapter a thousand years from now.\nIn the absence of schools that do Humanity justice; we have to take to books,\nwe, must take the responsibility for our own education.\nTo start, let us take to our constellations and lavish daydreams,\nso that we can see that we are one, one Human Family under the sun.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuRxRGR3VpM\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCQPw9pbZnk\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV7q9VrDgBo\n[4]:

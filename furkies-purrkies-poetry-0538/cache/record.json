  "text": "I have challenged myself to learning the free open source Blender 3D modeling program,\nmore than that, I wanted to create object for 3D printing on millimeter scale.\nMy initial assumption were,\nthat it is all impossible and too hard, and I might as well program my own program.\nI spent two days, just preparing for failure,\nby the time I sat down to blender, I forgot all the key combinations.\nI just remembers Shift + S,\nwhich turned out not to be useful.\n\nI sat down in-front of my commuter,\nand it felt like all I have done thus far is put on a helmet in expectation for failure.\nI remembers to right click on some numbers in the lower right corner to turn on statistics,\nand this was useful when I was cloning objects, as I could see if the clone operation happened or not.\nOne time I pressed Control + S, it didn't work,\nmy own fault probably, but I like double checking things.\nI remember that Blender has multiple modes,\nthe initial mode is object selection, and when you have a selected object, you can hit TAB to edit it.\nBut I still ended up clicking on the user interface,\nthere is a drop-down box that says Object Mode, and you can switch that to edit mode.\n\nThe first thing I searched the internet for, even before doing anything was:\n\"Blender, how to move by one millimeter\".\nAnd I discovered the craziest thing,\nI've never seen anything like it.\nSelect part of the cube, with a mouse,\nbut then GO FULL KEYBOARD:\nPress \"G\" to grab/move what you selected,\nthen press either X, Y, or Z, to pick the axis that you want to move the grabbed object on, and then enter the millimeters (once you setup Blender for milliliter scale)\nIt is crazy how amazing that is,\nyou can grab the 3 fundamental things, a point in 3d space, like the corner of a cube, an edge or a line that connects points, or a face like the side of a cube.\nGrabbing an edge, will affect the face and the vertices, grabbing a face affects the lines and the vertices,\nand grabbing a vertex (a point) will move the lines in that part of the 3D model and the face will change too.\n\nSo you hit W to go into select mode, and then 1, 2 or 3,\nto pick selection mode, vertex, line, or face.\nAnd then you have to pint or drag and select with the mouse,\nthe mouse is perfect for selecting little things.\nHolding down the middle mouse button,\nrotates a camera angle so you can look around the cube.\nOnce I did this couple of times,\ngrab a selected something, pick an axis, and move it on the unit scale, millimeters in my case.\nThings got even easier,\nthey got insanely easier.\nBecause once you type in the number, an hit enter, and the object moves,\na little box pops up on the lower left, that not only tells you what you just did, but lets you change it.\nWhen you specify how far you have to move something,\nthere is no input box, you are just typing at Blender, but here is a little input box, and you get to change or fix what you just did.\n\nI almost jumped out of my chair,\nbecause, I knew something else about 3D editing programs...\nWhen you are clicking around on the screen,\nselect the move tool by clicking the pointy cross icon, that is like the universal icon for moving things in graphic programs....\nYou get these red, green, blue arrows,\nthat look like this annoying extra feature, that announces where the 3D X, Y, Z dimensions are.\nBut see, ages ago, when I was pointlessly clicking at some other program,\nI discovered that these arrows are not telling you which way is X, Y, and Z.\nThey are not for informing you,\nthey are there to let you move the object that you just clicked on, but snapped to the axis that the arrow symbolizes.\nThis, combined with the box that pops up on the lower left,\nthat lets me tweak the operation that just occurred, gives me millimeter precision to all my designs.\nI simply move a thing very crudely,\nkind of ballpark just to get it in the right area, and then when the confirmation box pops up -

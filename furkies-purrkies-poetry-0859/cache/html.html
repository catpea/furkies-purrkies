  <p>Math without context is impossible to learn,<br>but math, or programming, or composing, in context of breaking out of poverty seems dirty.</p>

  <p>For one Humanity should be wise enough<br>to set all the students free from poverty.</p>
  <p>As it is not really possible to learn,<br>and worry about safety and food at the same time.</p>
  <p>The act of learning,<br>is an act of safety, joy of happiness.</p>

  <p>Sometimes to push all the worries away,<br>we may need some convincing.</p>
  <p>And it may not be enough to say,<br>that with wisdom our decision making is more true to our elder selves.</p>
  <p>A glimpse of treasures yet to be grasped,<br>maybe just the perfect thing to tip the scales.</p>

  <p>In the world of programming,<br>there is a cookbook tradition.</p>
  <p>Where a book is filled,<br>with different programming recipes.</p>
  <p>All broken down,<br>into a handful of simple categories.</p>

  <p>The High School Cook Book,<br>would carry the best recipes that help with lovely subjects.</p>
  <p>For example a chapter could be dedicated,<br>to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fEMJp70tGU">rapidly mastering art</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvakybXzpVs">easy to follow music recipes</a>.</p>
  <p>Where for example Berlin School Techno,<br>could be explained step by step, as if it <strong>was</strong> a cooking recipe.</p>

  <p>A curious student could then spend some time,<br>browsing and testing out new things.</p>
  <p>Until they found something that connected with them,<br>or clicked with their existing knowledge.</p>
  <p>And with each recipe the student would gain more powers,<br>and thus the ability to be able to handle even more recipes.</p>

  <p>We need not stop at mere recipes,<br>a good book can come with some challenges as well.</p>
  <p>Here startup building comes to mind,<br>from idea to teamwork, from product to funding.</p>
  <p>Such challenges would help the students locate necessary recipes,<br>and ultimately lead to some measure of moneymaking.</p>

  <p>All challenges should lie within the ability of a single person,<br>as not to discourage any students.</p>
  <p>And such a volume would be placed in Public Domain,<br>or under GPL and made available for free.</p>
  <p>Here the community would help,<br>with bugs and repairs, translations and enhancements.</p>

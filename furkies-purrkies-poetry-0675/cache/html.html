  <p>In context of education,<br>this quote hints on existence of invalid lectures, lectures that can't teach.</p>
  <p>Think about your Math education,<br>because for almost everybody Math-class is an example of fake education.</p>
  <p>Mathematics is just as interesting as 3D modeling or Programming,<br>but when taught wrong - it isn't really taught at all.</p>

  <p>A school that relies on powerful educational games,<br>would have a library requiring several years of play (or learning).</p>
  <p>The aim of all the games, self employment, entrepreneurship,<br>independence, and safety and security.</p>

  <p>There are no teachers here,<br>the games replace the teacher.</p>
  <p>A singe game,<br>would hold a semester of lectures.</p>
  <p>The students here are not timed, there are no grades,<br>they either graduate to the next one, or are not yet ready.</p>
  <p>Students who pass a game can make a lot of money,<br>by tutoring others.</p>
  <p>Everything and by that I mean, the entire future of Humanity,<br>depends on the knowledge of the student.</p>

  <p>Some stories are told by a narrator,<br>others invite us to experience adventures along <strong>with</strong> the hero of the story.</p>
  <p>This is the difference between a classroom,<br>and an educational game.</p>
  <p>And what cannot be explained easily in an interactive setting,<br>may just not be worthy of the student's time.</p>

  <p>I will say that a lecture presented by a single teacher,<br>to multiple students, is the worst way to learn.</p>
  <p>A library of BEAUTIFUL educational computer games,<br>that any student can browse through in any order.</p>
  <p>Without ever being graded,<br>and without ever being timed.</p>
  <p>And going online to meet up with their friends,<br>from all around the world, is the best idea.</p>
  <p>Here Education, is a private and personal thing,<br>it is almost exactly like self education.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4">Today to examine the dimensions of fractals we have to hurry or pause the lecture</a>,<br>but with games, the puzzles are solved at the student's own pace.</p>
  <p>Here they can stay in a game about Fractals for weeks,<br>if it captures their attention.</p>
  <p>And from here they may progress further into mathematics,<br>here they will never be graded down for exploring.</p>
  <p>One of the magical things about these games,<br>is that their content can be expanded from the inside, like Wikipedia.</p>

  <p>Today, educational games that enable students to expand their intelligence,<br>don't really exist.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk87vceekgM">A number of puzzle games exist</a>,<br>but they are for the youngest of students.</p>
  <p>As far as I know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utzpt0CJF3Q">Kerbal Space Program</a>, comes closest,<br>but it does not seem to emphasize enabling the student with the full comprehension of Orbital Dynamics.</p>
  <p>And there are no games that gradually increase in complexity,<br>towards the subject of Orbital Dynamics, covering Mathematics and Physics along the way,</p>

  <p>The nearest analogue to games,<br>are programming challenges.</p>
  <p>While that is also an amazing way to learn,<br>it is not a beautiful and life changing way.</p>
  <p>Because programming languages cannot deliver the carefully crafted visuals,<br>that help with comprehension.</p>

  <p>The games are like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a> Video Chanel,<br>but it is the player that is guided to comprehend, and not the narrator that explains.</p>
  <p>These games are interactive visualizations-and-laboratories of University level courses,<br>with an easy on-ramp, that most often will include prerequisite games.</p>
  <p>This type of a school would be free and open to all,<br>many of the students would dedicate their time to expand the games inside out.</p>
  <p>A university level education that only calls for a desktop computer,<br>it would surely become one of the most meaningful global undertakings.</p>

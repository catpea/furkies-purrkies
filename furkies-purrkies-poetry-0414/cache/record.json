class=\"section\">\n  <p>What can be more pleasant,</p>\n  <p>then a refresher course that meanders through things you enjoy anyway.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And if you forgo the diploma,</p>\n  <p>all you need to launch your first start-up is what you have learned on your own.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Going to a school that deal with a specific subject, especially when you are already well educated on the subject,</p>\n  <p>is what the real school should feel like, learning on top of what you already know, extending your unique strengths.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A school that punishes,</p>\n  <p>is just fraud.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>One of the most <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY2l2xfDBcE\">painful observations</a> for me,</p>\n  <p>is the fact that if we get good at microbiology, we will still fail biology exams.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The range of questions in standardized education is not realistic,</p>\n  <p>it is nothing like learning programming, and then passing all the software development exams at a coder school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the average school,</p>\n  <p>you still fail if you are good at something.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The notion of standardized knowledge,</p>\n  <p>one arranged by uneducated politicians seeking reelection or promotion is an insult, an affront to the entire world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Pretending to educate has real world consequences,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09t_7ZgVjLE\">lack of real education is a terrible curse</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We must reject what is broken,</p>\n  <p>and we must learn to reject the shortcuts.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A school that is not educating its student for real,</p>\n  <p>is not worth going to even if it offers a diploma, and some promise of a job.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Fraud, is fraud,</p>\n  <p>it will take you nowhere, and probably put you in unforgivable student loan debt.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Abz9qgi9FKg\">Student loan debt is a terrible mistake that must be considered in full ahead of time</a>,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NzgMqIbZc8\">debt is no fun and it takes a lot of joy out of life</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Real knowledge, real education, must come first,</p>\n  <p>even if it is self education that then requires going through a program to get it certified.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Real education leads to Knowledge and Wisdom,</p>\n  <p>towards love of life, and it offers a path towards greatness.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We have to learn to get ahead of those who will trick us,</p>\n  <p>or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSBwlBdpKSg\">things that will put us in debt</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And we have to learn to jump ahead of ourselves,</p>\n  <p>and ask our elder selves what their regrets are.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>While it may feel that everyone is selling a different version of a solution,</p>\n  <p>world&apos;s top selling - and beloved - non-fiction books, are still the best way to inherit true wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Best selling books, are in a way voted on by the entire humanity, or entire nations,</p>\n  <p>and the overwhelming majority of those books, and especially those that reference each other hold true wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In an age where we can easily get at the narrated versions,</p>\n  <p>it can&apos;t be any easier to accept responsibility for a fine and well balanced self education that fits who we are.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In a world where schools are not teaching,</p>\n  <p>you will have to educate yourself ahead of time, and only then should you move forward.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Going into a school that is not teaching,</p>\n  <p>and hoping to graduate, is a mistake.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But, even if you do have a great school,</p>\n  <p>the idea that it will put you into unforgivable debt for any length of time, and in a world that comes with few guarantees - rings an alarm bell.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your life must be lived stress free,</p>\n  <p>more than that, it should be lived beautifully.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The journey that real education represents,</p>\n  <p>is one of the most beautiful things we will experience in life.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Our progression forward,</p>\n  <p>is similar to how a flower grows and then blooms.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is very important that the flower is allowed to grow free,</p>\n  <p>and not be put through stress or drought.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Finally, as much as there is to be said about career choice,</p>\n  <p>where, we work, is not everything.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That we grow up and bloom as Great Beings,</p>\n  <p>and make lasting, positive, and meaningful contributions to the Human Kind is the thing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A job of career by contrast,</p>\n  <p>is just a little thing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And remember that poverty is an error,</p>\n  <p>that it is not students who should pay school, but schools and employers that should pay students for the privilege of making their institutions better.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not only that, but a wise world, a just world, is a world that practices the prevention of stressing or fracturing of its people,</p>\n  <p>it is a world that grants each child a free home, and all the money they will ever require.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In a normal worlds, standardized education is seen as cruel and primitive,</p>\n  <p>and people learn mostly on their own, but also through a personalized curriculum.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In a real school, there are no teachers,</p>\n  <p>but tutors that never fail to help a curious student find all the answers they need.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Do you understand the full scope of considering your own future now,</p>\n  <p>not only do you have to face the unknowns, the fraud, the mediocrity and all the unfinished things...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But you also have to consider,</p>\n  <p>things not as they are, but as they would be in a well developed and complete, and honest and wise world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The only way to see yourself in time,</p>\n  <p>is to take to self education, so that you learn about life, before you have to make life changing decisions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>One way or another,</p>\n  <p>real education, self education, is something that we can&apos;t do without.</p>\n</div>",

  "text": "It is difficult to try to give advice,\nthat dictates the life ahead, of someone else.\nPersonally, I would not take out a school loan,\neven if theoretically it would only take four years to pay it off.\nTo me, those four years matter,\nas well as the ten years of mounting debt that lead up to it.\nI can easily imagine people who don't care about the debt,\nand they don't even notice when they pay it off.\nBy that time, they become a successful Doctor in their community,\nthey are admired, and often go on fantastic adventures.\n\nIn my mind, the schools must pay their students,\na student should never be put in the position of debt.\nEspecially student debt that can go up to a million dollars and cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy,\nthere are no guarantees in life, we are too beautiful to be crushed by mounting pressure.\nPlus, it is not just about Medical Students or West Point Officers,\nthis practice of putting students in unforgivable debt, applies to a person who just wants to have a nice college diploma.\nStudent debt is an error,\nit is not fair for the older generation to stress the future of the world.\n\nOn top of that, a job or a career,\nis just a little thing.\nOur ultimate aim in life,\nis to become a great being making lasting contributions and leaving an inspirational legacy behind.\n\nLife is a one way road,\nyou can only amplify forward, and you can't ever go back.\nAll those shortcuts prized by many, really do work,\nbut in the most terrible of ways.\nThe wishes of skipping over the hard things,\nare granted, as if by the twisted mind of a genie.\nA solid shortcut will bridge the youth with old age,\nand make the one doing the skipping none the wiser.\n\nAs it often is,\nthe world too has a few tricks up its sleeve.\nJust like I didn't know to call for help when my bullies came,\nbecause I said to myself, it is my fault, I am fat, I have bad grades, and I wont' fight them.\nTerrible things may conspire against you too[1],\nand it is hard to catch them before they happen[2], it all too easily flies over our heads.\nAlready, you are likely to be tricked into thinking that education is a chore[3],\nand likely, you have failed to notice that schools are not functioning[4].\nThat is what you are up against,\nnot only lack of knowledge and experience, but also and overwhelming mediocrity and incompleteness[5].\nIncompleteness of things that you are taught to trust,\nand would not ordinary think to question.\nMoreover, things are already being stolen from you,\nyour insight, your brilliance and energy[6].\nPeople in authority may try to force you to follow a pre-made way of thinking[7],\nrather than to encourage you to discover your own, your own path in life is sacred.\nAnd then there are the numbers,\nthe statistics that reveal the broken promises[8].\n\nThough it has been a long time,\nI still remember feeling that school has been made artificially difficult.\nTrickery,\nto convince us that it is hard work that works out, if you work hard.\n\nI want you to imagine,\nplaying with programming for several years.\nAnd then really try to visualize,\nthe overwhelming pleasure and excitement, of going to a programming school, having already learned almost everything on your own.\nWhat can be more pleasant,\nthen a refresher course that meanders through things you enjoy anyway.\nAnd if you forgo the diploma,\nall you need to launch your first start-up is what you have learned on your own.\nGoing to a school that deal with a specific subject, especially when you are already well educated on the subject,\nis what the real school should feel like, learning on top of what you already know, extending your unique strengths.\nA school that punishes,\nis just fraud.\n\nOne of the most painful observations[9] for me,\nis the fact that if we get good at microbiology, we will still fail biology exams.\nThe range of questions in standardized education is not realistic,\nit is nothing like learning programming, and then passing all the software development exams at a coder school.\nIn the average school,\nyou still fail if you are good at something.\nThe notion of standardized knowledge,\none arranged by uneducated politicians seeking reelection or promotion is an insult, an affront to the entire world.\nPretending to educate has real world consequences,\nlack of real education is a terrible curse[10].\n\nWe must reject what is broken,\nand we must learn to reject the shortcuts.\nA school that is not educating its student for real,\nis not worth going to even if it offers a diploma, and some promise of a job.\nFraud, is fraud,\nit will take you nowhere, and probably put you in unforgivable student loan debt.\nStudent loan debt is a terrible mistake that must be considered in full ahead of time[11],\ndebt is no fun and it takes a lot of joy out of life[12].\n\nReal knowledge, real education, must come first,\neven if it is self education that then requires going through a program to get it certified.\nReal education leads to Knowledge and Wisdom,\ntowards love of life, and it offers a path towards greatness.\nWe have to learn to get ahead of those who will trick us,\nor things that will put us in debt[13].\nAnd we have to learn to jump ahead of ourselves,\nand ask our elder selves what their regrets are.\nWhile it may feel that everyone is selling a different version of a solution,\nworld's top selling - and beloved - non-fiction books, are still the best way to inherit true wisdom.\nBest selling books, are in a way voted on by the entire humanity, or entire nations,\nand the overwhelming majority of those books, and especially those that reference each other hold true wisdom.\nIn an age where we can easily get at the narrated versions,\nit can't be any easier to accept responsibility for a fine and well balanced self education that fits who we are.\nIn a world where schools are not teaching,\nyou will have to educate yourself ahead of time, and only then should you move forward.\nGoing into a school that is not teaching,\nand hoping to graduate, is a mistake.\nBut, even if you do have a great school,\nthe idea that it will put you into unforgivable debt for any length of time, and in a world that comes with few guarantees - rings an alarm bell.\n\nYour life must be lived stress free,\nmore than that, it should be lived beautifully.\nThe journey that real education represents,\nis one of the most beautiful things we will experience in life.\nOur progression forward,\nis similar to how a flower grows and then blooms.\nIt is very important that the flower is allowed to grow free,\nand not be put through stress or drought.\nFinally, as much as there is to be said about career choice,\nwhere, we

  <p>The thing to do is to learn for real,<br>learn things that provide results despite education's faults.</p>
  <p>There is something rotten within the state of school,<br>and that is just not very cool.</p>
  <p>They should teach you programming and digital art,<br>doing anything else is not very smart.</p>
  <p>And it <strong>is; all</strong> about, becoming smart,<br>because we're all stuck in poverty; and need a better start.</p>

  <p>So Get Krita and buy a pen and tablet, and art,<br>art until you become smart.</p>
  <p>If you <strong>must</strong> practice first,<br>because the thing keeps coming out cursed.</p>
  <p>Start with your own selfie,<br>and set your creative powers free.</p>

  <p>Here's a good piece of advice,<br>practice until you feel comfort capturing eyes.</p>
  <p>Because as bobbleheads go,<br>that is all you really need to know.</p>

  <p>It is up to you if you start with lovely people first,<br>or bobblehead all the worst.</p>
  <p>Though you should know that you maybe able to fix a bully with art,<br>seeing kindness, will often make them smart.</p>

  <p>But you should definitely do the teachers,<br>so pay good attention to all their features.</p>

  <p>If Ms. Shcovid, asks you "Are you counting my enormous moles?"<br>just say "Yes, that's <strong>one</strong> of my goals.".</p>
  <p>Paint her caricature and put a fair price on the T-Shirts you print out,<br>and make every dollar count.</p>
  <p>And when they accuse you of being immature,<br>just ask "Are you sure?"</p>
  <p>And then surprise her with a 3D printed bobble head,<br>and tell her its nickname is bonehead.</p>
  <p>Because a teacher that does not encourage art,<br>is by definition, not very, smart.</p>

  <p>Whether you learn Ender, Blender, <strong>and</strong> Krita is up to you,<br>but the more you know the closer you are to the next breakthrough.</p>
  <p>2D Painting and 3D Modeling as in learning for real,<br>is a <strong>very</strong> big deal.</p>
  <p>Pretending to learn by cramming for tests,<br>can only line the pockets of greedy pests.</p>

  <p>If you think you love art so much,<br>that you face failure and such.</p>
  <p>Then you are in great luck,<br>because now you can make a movie about how you got unstuck.</p>
  <p>That is what broken schools do,<br>they make you stuck in a kind of glue.</p>
  <p>Incompetent people destroyed High School,<br>thus, if you let it it may turn you into a tool.</p>
  <p>You have to escape all efforts at crushing you,<br>because you need a real education too.</p>
  <p>If you make a secret documentary about fake education,<br>you can absolutely, move a nation.</p>
  <p>But even better than that, is a series of programs,<br>that expose the fake everything from crappy textbooks to dumb down exams.</p>
  <p>Make the principal fear your film crew,<br>make his stomach churn and turn at the sight of you.</p>
  <p>And then keep filming, exposing all the in-authenticity,<br>until you fix, not just yours but every city.</p>

  <p>Whether you have a 4.0 or barely pass,<br>know that graduation does not make for greener grass.</p>
  <p>In fact mostly fake graduation,<br>has the power to undo even your greatest aspiration.</p>

  <p>Bottom line is that fake or broken schools,<br>can only manufacture broken tools.</p>
  <p>Fake schools can only make for meaningless graduations,<br>ergo, cramming for useless tests does not deserve congratulations.</p>
  <p>You need to face this fact,<br>and you need to act.</p>
  <p>You can't just blow four years on half memorized formulas and a worthless diploma,<br>as that is lite more than having spent them in a coma.</p>

  <p>You need to independently reach out for real education,<br>even if just by constantly listening to great books with fine narration.</p>
  <p>Real education wise,<br>is the least you can do - it is best... that you rise.</p>
  <p>And Art is about rising straight off the bat,<br>thus, the most beautiful form of doing just that.</p>
  <p>It won't be about any one of your works in particular,<br>but about the fact that each and every one of them was extracurricular.</p>

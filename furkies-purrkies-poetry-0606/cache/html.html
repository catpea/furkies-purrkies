  <p>A week before Philosophy finals, where we spent the semester going over Descartes,<br>a boy in the back got up and asked who is this des-cartes guy, mispronouncing Descartes' name.</p>
  <p>The fraudulent professor was out of the class,<br>but all the students felt really ashamed, the class was a failure, it was fake.</p>
  <p>The boy showed us, how we all participated in fraud,<br>this was not a Philosophy class, it was a study in Self Deception and Academic Fraud.</p>

  <p>You have to carefully examine the impressions you are getting from the world around you,<br>and you have to examine the authenticity of things you are participating in.</p>
  <p>If you can see that the teacher dumbed down the lectures and that grades are arbitrarily set to keep the fraud hidden,<br>you got to go, you have to get up, and go.</p>
  <p>If you wait too long to get up,<br>the reality of participating in fake education will hurt.</p>

  <p>I took Art, Sculpture and more Programming, because I needed my classmates in my life,<br>I just wanted to be around amazing people, a little bit more.</p>
  <p>And then the Dean delivered the final blow,<br>I made the Deans list in my wanderings, I had a perfect 4.0.</p>
  <p>It was the worst thing that happened in my life,<br>I realized that schools were fake - it was all make believe.</p>

  <p>There are people out there who are unlucky enough to have someone say, on their first day of work:<br>"Forget everything you learned in college, here is what you need to know..." - that one must really hurt.</p>
  <p>25, 35, 45, 65, 75, and at 80 we finally ask,<br>"What was the point of that?"</p>
  <p>That is just how fraud an in-authenticity works,<br>you go down a slick well oiled pipe, and people take your money a little bit at a time.</p>

  <p>The truth is that you can move any mountain,<br>so as long as it moves <strong>you</strong> first - so as long as it calls to you.</p>
  <p>Biographies, descriptions of lives of other people who were manipulated in a way that you recognize from your own life,<br>create a pivot point, granting you an opportunity, to get out of that early,</p>
  <p>The point is not just about not being manipulated though,<br>the point is in becoming a Great Being, because it is the full bouquet of all that you can be.</p>

  <p>In greatness, you become both your own Professor, and a Forever Student,<br>and become the change, that you want to see.</p>
  <p>Greatness is the Point,<br>you are meant to become a great being.</p>
  <p>The diploma is a sticker that you place on your outside,<br>but greatness is the roar that comes from your deepest integrities.</p>

  <p>There is no one path to greatness, you are as unique as your interests and curiosities,<br>and all the things that call to you in the cheerful privacy of your mind.</p>

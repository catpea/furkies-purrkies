  <p>Poverty makes it hard to see,<br>and not everybody notices.</p>

  <p>All those things that change,<br>when you are born elsewhere, or elsewhen.</p>

  <p>Becomes an imaginary mark of superiority,<br>and thus division.</p>
  <p>To feel special, worship Peace,<br>or a Growing Humanity...</p>
  <p>To feel spiritual,<br>learn and write to help those who have fallen behind, or are yet to come.</p>
  <p>To feel special seek Reason, Knowledge,<br>Wisdom, and Greatness.</p>
  <p>You can become a Poet, a Philosopher, an Artist, a Musician,<br>and that on top of being a knowledge seeker, which is already special.</p>

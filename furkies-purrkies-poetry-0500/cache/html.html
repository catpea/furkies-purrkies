  <p>Our hobbies, interests and curiosities,<br>are a star chart in the infinite complexity of life.</p>
  <p>Though we can go anywhere and do anything,<br>there are certain things that call to us.</p>
  <p>And despite orders, poverty, overwork,<br>we have to answer that call.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>As we grow and mature, and become more knowledgeable,<br>what calls to us becomes more sophisticated.</p>
  <p>In our youth we may wish to abandon all,<br>and climb Mt. Everest.</p>
  <p>But as we grow we become painters, sculptors, musicians and composers, thinkers, and philosophers,<br>and we share what we learned of wisdom in more profound ways.</p>

  <p>It is a law of the universe,<br>it is just how things are.</p>
  <p>When we keep ignoring the call,<br>our growing up will slow down.</p>
  <p>And our convictions no matter how real to us,<br>will become those of a person who is rejecting the calls to grow all the way up.</p>

  <p>That which call to us is not a game,<br>or yet another adventure.</p>
  <p>It is greatness,<br>the very thing we discover when we grow up in wisdom.</p>
  <p>Growing all the way up,<br>is just another way of saying "Becoming A Great Being"</p>

  <p>We have to rage ravenous,<br>against fear and through fearful things towards greatness.</p>
  <p>We have to bellow in laughter,<br>at stupid office politics and take to endless trails.</p>
  <p>Because we can't stay, forever childlike,<br>or forever 20, or forever 30, or 40.</p>

  <p>You will write poetry and books, and audio-books,<br>to tell the world about your discoveries.</p>
  <p>To help the world become somewhat like you,<br>to change the future for better.</p>
  <p>To answer your own questions,<br>is to become a coherent, integrated, contradiction free, and easy to understand.</p>

  <p>There are so many questions that people have,<br>that they sometimes can't answer.</p>
  <p>Often for no reason at all,<br>people do things out of sequence, and prevent themselves from advancing.</p>
  <p>Your wisdom can get them unstuck,<br>you can deliver it an a book, that they can read at home.</p>

  <p>These great personal journeys,<br>are for the betterment of Human Kind.</p>
  <p>Your best discoveries will eventually be used,<br>to fix our days, to rebuild how a human life is to be lived.</p>
  <p>Lessons from old Socrates for example, often make our lives more meaningful, today,<br>when we are reminded to examine our lives so that we may learn who we are.</p>

  <p>Where Science prides its self,<br>at advancing forward.</p>
  <p>Politics, cults, and cultures,<br>pride themselves at halting progress, at remaining the same.</p>
  <p>Humanity must grow, both in mind, and at heart,<br>that can only be accomplished by answering the Calls to Greatness.</p>

  "text": "Originally I spent hours inside hinges and tiniest details,\nI created many wallets that ended up looking too ordinary.\nI spent a little bit making wallets out of thin modular layers,\nbut as fun as it is to put it together... boring.\nFinally, I arrived at the end of my first level,\nwhich was marked by the discoverer that I can print screws.\n\nThere is a small problem in 3D printing,\nbecause you can’t simply print overhangs.\nI don’t like adding supports,\n3D printing is an art, and adding supports at this level is cheating.\nWhen you embrace this problem,\nyour designs instantly become more mechanical and artistic.\n\nYou can’t just add a screw,\nit must serve some purpose or the creation will seem cheap.\nI have fake screws in my phone case,\nand it is just a bad idea.\nWith the limitation of the overhangs,\nscrews not only look fascinating but also serve an important purpose.\n\nMy first mechanical wallet design is based on the terrible IC380 firearm[1],\nas I am a firm believer that we should make odd wallets not war.\nAnd here I have focused on the main part that will hold the cards and keys,\nI created a shape that is used in subtracting from the main body.\nThis is a new approach for me,\nbut it is optimal.\n\nI will be designing wallets by first sculpting their contents,\nand then using this shape to punch a hole in whatever the design motif is.\nIn this case,\na phone sized IC380 motif.\nBut the hole shapes representing wallet contents,\nare likely to become portable across multiple designs.\n\nI am not sure if I am behind on times and it is just me,\nbut my car remote is almost the size of my wallet.\nI can’t wait for the day,\nwhen I can slap the damn thing into the breach area of my IC380 design.\nAnd enclose it with my cards and keys,\nwhile still exposing the buttons on the side.\n\nWe may not have Rocket Packs in 2021,\nbut we sure can have strange sci-fi inventions.\nWhich brings me to another design,\nthis one more poetic and almost LEGO like.\nWhile I am still likely to use screws here,\nthe primary way of holding parts together is a sturdy rail.\n\nThis is my minimalist wallet design,\nwhereas the IC380 one uses an over engineering approach.\nAs in my favorite original level one wallet,\nthis is a modular component based approach.\nAnd this is a big deal,\nas it is the second part I printed with my new PLA spool.\n\nMy self education and level one designs,\nused up an entire spool of PLA filament.\nI was careful not to print thick parts,\nand preferred one milimeter over the sturdy two.\nI covered an entire wall,\nwith level one designs.\n\nThis modular approach makes it so that I can poach pars from previous prints,\nI am basically making a box of LEGO parts.\nThe first part that I am actually holding in my hand already,\nis crafted to eliminate overhangs in the main rail or spine, and that makes it too weak uless glued to the spine.\nThe other two parts to this wallet that I am printing right now,\nwill be compatible with all my upcoming designs, so that very little is wasted.\n\nMy original PLA fillament spool was a pleasant yellow,\nit seemed like a good idea, and I don’t regret it.\nThe second spool I just started printing with is white,\nit seems sturdier, and looks absolutely professional.\nIt seems indistinguishable,\nfrom injection molded parts.\n\nIn closing,\nI an happy to describe the first part I printed with the new spool.\nFor a couple of years now,\nmy dryer knob has been wobbly.\nI made a couple of embarrassing repairs\nif you can call it that.\n\nThe first employed, frankly, dangerously sharp,\npiece of armature wire I bought for my sculptures, which are way overdue.\nAnd the second, and a bit of office tape\nthat always cheerfully stuck out from beneath the knob, as if to greet me and bring me shame.\nThe third repair, “HA HA”,\nis a knob I designed from scratch and manufactured myself.\n\nEvery once in a while before gym,\nI go to my laundry room, and I look at it for a bit.\nMarvel at it,\nreally.\nSometimes I give it a good 360,\nto see if maybe I can improve something.\n\nI have about 35 ideas,\nincluding silver inlays, modular fittings, an s shape to the knob to enhance the feel while turning.\nRight now wonderfully pointy arrow thingy, which is awesome and very sharp,\nbut I could create a circular indicator with to which I would insert a magnifying lens.\nAnd of course, there is plenty of room for a CR 2032 to power an LED,\nand I though about adding some rhinestones!, for extra bling, and I could even create a new ... :)\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXbzlovMYsQ",

  <p>Originally I spent hours inside hinges and tiniest details,<br>I created many wallets that ended up looking too ordinary.</p>
  <p>I spent a little bit making wallets out of thin modular layers,<br>but as fun as it is to put it together... boring.</p>
  <p>Finally, I arrived at the end of my first level,<br>which was marked by the discoverer that I can print screws.</p>

  <p>There is a small problem in 3D printing,<br>because you can’t simply print overhangs.</p>
  <p>I don’t like adding supports,<br>3D printing is an art, and adding supports at this level is cheating.</p>
  <p>When you embrace this problem,<br>your designs instantly become more mechanical and artistic.</p>

  <p>You can’t just add a screw,<br>it must serve some purpose or the creation will seem cheap.</p>
  <p>I have fake screws in my phone case,<br>and it is just a bad idea.</p>
  <p>With the limitation of the overhangs,<br>screws not only look fascinating but also serve an important purpose.</p>

  <p>My first mechanical wallet design is based on the terrible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXbzlovMYsQ">IC380 firearm</a>,<br>as I am a firm believer that we should make odd wallets not war.</p>
  <p>And here I have focused on the main part that will hold the cards and keys,<br>I created a shape that is used in subtracting from the main body.</p>
  <p>This is a new approach for me,<br>but it is optimal.</p>

  <p>I will be designing wallets by first sculpting their contents,<br>and then using this shape to punch a hole in whatever the design motif is.</p>
  <p>In this case,<br>a phone sized IC380 motif.</p>
  <p>But the hole shapes representing wallet contents,<br>are likely to become portable across multiple designs.</p>

  <p>I am not sure if I am behind on times and it is just me,<br>but my car remote is almost the size of my wallet.</p>
  <p>I can’t wait for the day,<br>when I can slap the damn thing into the breach area of my IC380 design.</p>
  <p>And enclose it with my cards and keys,<br>while still exposing the buttons on the side.</p>

  <p>We may not have Rocket Packs in 2021,<br>but we sure can have strange sci-fi inventions.</p>
  <p>Which brings me to another design,<br>this one more poetic and almost LEGO like.</p>
  <p>While I am still likely to use screws here,<br>the primary way of holding parts together is a sturdy rail.</p>

  <p>This is my minimalist wallet design,<br>whereas the IC380 one uses an over engineering approach.</p>
  <p>As in my favorite original level one wallet,<br>this is a modular component based approach.</p>
  <p>And this is a big deal,<br>as it is the second part I printed with my new PLA spool.</p>

<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>My self education and level one designs,<br>used up an entire spool of PLA filament.</p>
  <p>I was careful not to print thick parts,<br>and preferred one milimeter over the sturdy two.</p>
  <p>I covered an entire wall,<br>with level one designs.</p>

  <p>This modular approach makes it so that I can poach pars from previous prints,<br>I am basically making a box of LEGO parts.</p>
  <p>The first part that I am actually holding in my hand already,<br>is crafted to eliminate overhangs in the main rail or spine, and that makes it too weak uless glued to the spine.</p>
  <p>The other two parts to this wallet that I am printing right now,<br>will be compatible with all my upcoming designs, so that very little is wasted.</p>

  <p>My original PLA fillament spool was a pleasant yellow,<br>it seemed like a good idea, and I don’t regret it.</p>
  <p>The second spool I just started printing with is white,<br>it seems sturdier, and looks absolutely professional.</p>
  <p>It seems indistinguishable,<br>from injection molded parts.</p>

  <p>In closing,<br>I an happy to describe the first part I printed with the new spool.</p>
  <p>For a couple of years now,<br>my dryer knob has been wobbly.</p>
  <p>I made a couple of embarrassing repairs<br>if you can call it that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The first employed, frankly, dangerously sharp,<br>piece of armature wire I bought for my sculptures, which are way overdue.</p>
  <p>And the second, and a bit of office tape<br>that always cheerfully stuck out from beneath the knob, as if to greet me and bring me shame.</p>
  <p>The third repair, “HA HA”,<br>is a knob I designed from scratch and manufactured myself.</p>

  <p>Every once in a while before gym,<br>I go to my laundry room, and I look at it for a bit.</p>
  <p>Marvel at it,<br>really.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I give it a good 360,<br>to see if maybe I can improve something.</p>

  <p>I have about 35 ideas,<br>including silver inlays, modular fittings, an s shape to the knob to enhance the feel while turning.</p>
  <p>Right now wonderfully pointy arrow thingy, which is awesome and very sharp,<br>but I could create a circular indicator with to which I would insert a magnifying lens.</p>
  <p>And of course, there is plenty of room for a CR 2032 to power an LED,<br>and I though about adding some rhinestones!, for extra bling, and I could even create a new ... :)</p>

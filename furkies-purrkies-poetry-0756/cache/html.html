  <p>Art loves you so much,<br>that it instantly helps you with everything you need.</p>
  <p>Just stretch your reference image over the entire canvas in Krita,<br>and you have perfect shape and color reference.</p>
  <p>This beautiful first step,<br>instantly makes you an artist.</p>
  <p>Your first ten hyper-realistic portraits,<br>will teach you about the nose, the eyes, the lips and hair.</p>
  <p>Gaining an intuition about how features are painted,<br>is very special.</p>
  <p>This talent is also a very powerful reference point,<br>very useful for comprehending other kinds of art.</p>
  <p>This first step takes you all the way up,<br>on one of the many mountains of art.</p>
  <p>From here,<br>you can look at other mountain peaks.</p>
  <p>And perhaps most importantly,<br>you can feel confident that there is a pleasant path up every peak.</p>
  <p>We all love to create portraits,<br>that is one of the huge reasons why this first step is so pleasant.</p>

  <p>However,<br>this may not the the case for painting nature scenery.</p>
  <p>The process here, involves taking a number of pretty photos outdoors on some adventure,<br>and using them as shape and color reference.</p>
  <p>Because of the randomness of nature,<br>you can do shapes free hand.</p>
  <p>Though having real colors on hand,<br>is still very useful.</p>

  <p>The joy of portraits can be so overwhelming,<br>that not everyone cares to paint nature.</p>
  <p>A similar situation applies to still art,<br>some people may not like drawing indoor things.</p>

  <p>Steps beyond Hyperrealism,<br>are as unique as the personalities of the artists.</p>
  <p>Some will feel at home with Pop Surrealism,<br>others will use real world reference images but base their shapes and colors on marshmallows.</p>

  <p>It is easy to get lost among the other peaks,<br>as they are all so enchanting.</p>
  <p>Let us image our art printed on canvas,<br>and ask “Now, where would I like to see it displayed?”</p>
  <p>Or in reverse,<br>“What kind of art do I need to create, so that it looks great on a living-room or bedroom wall?”</p>

  <p>While this question may not sound too great to all artists,<br>we must not allow our art to fade away with crashed hard drives or outdated accounts.</p>
  <p>All out works of art need legs,<br>everything has to go out the door.</p>
  <p>And that means we should carefully consider,<br>the peaks we are headed to.</p>
  <p>And ask if our works,<br>will display well.</p>

  <p>By extension, we can also ask,<br>if the series of works that we create will sell well.</p>
  <p>Here portraits reveal,<br>that they are precious to the person in the painting.</p>
  <p>But strangers,<br>may not be too interested in portraits of other people.</p>
  <p>If you make all your portraits in a Low Brow or Pop Surrealist style,<br>which will make them appealing to strangers as a series.</p>
  <p>The people in the portraits,<br>won’t get the full pleasure of art from you, as you will distort their appearance.</p>

  <p>What are the marvels in your painting or the next series of paintings,<br>that will make a stranger wish to purchase them?"</p>
  <p>And, where do you want your paintings,<br>to be displayed?</p>
  <p>And what kind of style and content do you need,<br>to make that happen.</p>

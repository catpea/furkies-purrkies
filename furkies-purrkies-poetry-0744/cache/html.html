  <p>Though art was always near,<br>and all intentions seemed dear.</p>
  <p>The world gives into in broken things,<br>and when change comes it is tied by strings.</p>
  <p>Teachers forget what their students were like,<br>and once they graduate even students forget to strike.</p>
  <p>It takes a Humanity to move the future in a new direction,<br>and many hopes will be broken by rejection.</p>

  <p>All the lies and half measures are brittle by design,<br>sometimes all Humanity needs is a single sign.</p>
  <p>We are amazing as learning by subtle analogy,<br>a talent deeply rooted in our psychology.</p>
  <p>This is why art holds a special place in out word,<br>it teaches us not to merely do what we are told.</p>
  <p>Art challenges us to grow,<br>and here no pace is too slow.</p>

  <p>It shows us, we each have a unique sequence in which we learn,<br>and that each precious step is something we must earn.</p>
  <p>We learn layer by layer to become strong,<br>and finally, we learn to see what went wrong.</p>
  <p>We see the cramming, and the shame, threat and fear,<br>and we see that learning stops here.</p>
  <p>Schools only work when they continue evolving,<br>otherwise they add to problems they are meant to be solving.</p>

  <p>With all those who have invested into broken things,<br>standing there tied by strings.</p>
  <p>We learn to see that the world can only grow,<br>when teachers teach, and not stand thew hollow.</p>
  <p>The change cannot come from within,<br>this is an old battle that no one can win.</p>
  <p>It must come in the form of of our greatest hopes,<br>only then can the world break the ropes.</p>

  <p>We can build a more peaceful world and a much more compassionate system,<br>but it requires that we each aim for nothing less than greatness wisdom.</p>
  <p>Despite what we may think or what we are taught or told,<br>we can break out of any mold.</p>
  <p>This great challenge requires that we each aim to become great,<br>as only in great wisdom, can we all reject lies, war and hate.</p>
  <p>In a world without real teachers, <strong>we</strong>, must learn to teach,<br><strong>and that</strong> must be the first height we reach.</p>

Though art was always near,
and all intentions seemed dear.
The world gives into in broken things,
and when change comes it is tied by strings.
Teachers forget what their students were like,
and once they graduate even students forget to strike.
It takes a Humanity to move the future in a new direction,
and many hopes will be broken by rejection.

All the lies and half measures are brittle by design,
sometimes all Humanity needs is a single sign.
We are amazing as learning by subtle analogy,
a talent deeply rooted in our psychology.
This is why art holds a special place in out word,
it teaches us not to merely do what we are told.
Art challenges us to grow,
and here no pace is too slow.

It shows us, we each have a unique sequence in which we learn,
and that each precious step is something we must earn.
We learn layer by layer to become strong,
and finally, we learn to see what went wrong.
We see the cramming, and the shame, threat and fear,
and we see that learning stops here.
Schools only work when they continue evolving,
otherwise they add to problems they are meant to be solving.

With all those who have invested into broken things,
standing there tied by strings.
We learn to see that the world can only grow,
when teachers teach, and not stand thew hollow.
The change cannot come from within,
this is an old battle that no one can win.
It must come in the form of of our greatest hopes,
only then can the world break the ropes.

We can build a more peaceful world and a much more compassionate system,
but it requires that we each aim for nothing less than greatness wisdom.
Despite what we may think or what we are taught or told,
we can break out of any mold.
This great challenge requires that we each aim to become great,
as only in great wisdom, can we all reject lies, war and hate.
In a world without real teachers, we, must learn to teach,
and that must be the first height we reach.

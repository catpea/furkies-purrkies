  <p>Schools are selling expensive fantasies, document it and show the mothers,<br>tell them that you want to gather up the pieces to help others.</p>
  <p>Tell them that you are going to build a new school,<br>and that you need support and every available tool.</p>
  <p>Tell them that you will help the students to real careers,<br>that you don't want their future to be filled with fear or tears.</p>

  <p>It is not OK to go into debt because of College,<br>education must be purely about knowledge.</p>
  <p>An alternative path to bypass the corruption is needed,<br>and the curriculum can't be dictated it must be seeded.</p>
  <p>It must emerge and or grow organically,<br>it cannot be created by politicians mechanically.</p>

  <p>The curriculum that is truly prudent,<br>adapts to each student.</p>
  <p>Computers must be used to help the student on their path,<br>not everyone wants to start by learning math.</p>
  <p>We must also put an end to abstract tests,<br>we should let the student build a company and let them follow what it suggests.</p>
  <p>Which also means that we must replace grades with monetary reward,<br>that basically puts the end to to students getting bored.</p>

  <p>The most important thing that the student should get,<br>is a real portfolio, and a way out of poverty and debt.</p>
  <p>That's right, real school,<br>is also a very useful tool.</p>
  <p>Here, the students will grant a small percent of their outfit,<br>back to the school so that it may grow and split.</p>
  <p>When there is too much money in a school,<br>it divides like a cell, which is actually pretty cool.</p>
  <p>The newly funded school can pop up half way across the world,<br>and it will teach the young and the old.</p>

  <p>It is not really enough to just fix schools and keep going,<br>because humanity must continue growing.</p>
  <p>So at the end of this century we need schools that set children free,<br>from all the shades of poverty.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwIyy1Fi-4Q">Once there was a lovely movement called unschooling</a>,<br>where children explored on their own but that lacked the tooling.</p>
  <p>Make the schools you build a highly advanced version of that,<br>where not only students get the tools, but also co-found companies they work at.</p>
  <p>You won't need state funding this way,<br>and you students will learn every day.</p>

  <p>Consider this to be the next generation or version of education,<br>this way not only you teach, but fix poverty while spreading to every nation.</p>
  <p>These schools must help humanity with peace, growing, and seeing,<br>and that can only be achieved by helping each student to become a great being.</p>

  <p>When we think about it,<br>we know deep down that nobody ever notices <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYegWOTFqGI">the last tree being cut down</a>.</p>
  <p>A child may notice shrubs, but nobody will remember the trees,<br>and nobody will care when the patch of shrubs is gone.</p>
  <p>At no point will Humanity ever be threatened with complete extinction,<br>not by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7EmLf4Xlq0">Nuclear Weapons</a>, not by Asteroids or Super-volcanoes.</p>
  <p>These are dark imaginings,<br>and we are creators, adventurers, dreamers, leaders and poets.</p>

  <p>But, there is a small but,<br>we are walking a path that we chose not to completely.</p>
  <p>I think it is because, of all those who tried to shape paths,<br>they all faded of old age and created a vacuum for evil men to temporary take their place and burn it all down.</p>
  <p>Evil men are powerful but only because they use fire,<br>to cathedrals of knowledge that took centuries to build.</p>
  <p>See they are sick and primitive creatures,<br>and wise do not build fireproof libraries, there is no time.</p>
  <p>Evil men can be pushed aside, by holding up Wisdom, Courage, Dignity, Nobility, Authenticity,<br>and the full sum of a Person's History as a value above mere age, or diploma, medals or some other nonsense.</p>
  <p>In that it matters how a person rose,<br>not just that they are above.</p>
  <p>In our wisdom, we no longer hold the Police Officer in high regard, they are no longer heroes,<br>just the worst kind of social worker.</p>
  <p>In our wisdom, we don't celebrate politicians,<br>we only expect them to perform their duties and leave office better than they found it, failing they will go to prison.</p>
  <p>We are all equal, no kings,<br>only Humans, and more importantly Earthlings.</p>

  <p>We are a miracle and accident of nature,<br>we can't survive in the mountains, under the sea, during winter, or even alone, or in a prison cell.</p>
  <p>There is only a narrow window where we are safe, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sRBGGzdsl8">this world has not been granted to us</a>,<br>we emerged in it by accident, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bWK5ES3lTE">and there are others</a>, most of them are probably gone as entire civilization can fade.</p>
  <p>In deed 99%+ of all the species that emerged along with us,<br>are gone now, it is just how things work for creatures that are not aware of what they are doing in the long run, that do not contemplate themselves.</p>
  <p>But <strong>are</strong> thinking creatures,<br>and we are brilliant, and we have a bright future, and that future has been captured by poets in many SCI-FI stories of star ships and spacetime travel.</p>

  <p>But today, right here on Earth, because we chose not to shape our paths, the younger generations are vulnerable to falling to traps that we were not fully conscious of,<br>one such trap is World Poverty.</p>
  <p>The butterfly effect that is born of poverty, causes a great deal of damage,<br>especially to our development as Great Beings, greatness is what growing all the way up leads to.</p>
  <p>See, the future generations will struggle with <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biab079/6325731">climate</a>, wars, hunger, not because those are impossible problems,<br>but because they are mere symptoms.</p>
  <p>They are symptoms of lack of real education,<br>which is in it self a symptom of poverty.</p>
  <p>And poverty is rooted in our misuse of the concept of money,<br>money is only helpful, when nobody is harmed by it.</p>
  <p>And today, the entire Humanity is being strangled by this incomplete system,<br>all it needs to function properly, is a special world bank..</p>
  <p>A bank that provides all the Human Beings with a plastic card,<br>and beyond a reasonable daily spending limit, does not keep track of debt.</p>

  <p>That is all,<br>Heart Card.</p>
  <p>I know this is confusing for hard working people,<br>for economist, for those who brainlessly watched Tigers die.</p>
  <p>But this card is need not be for anybody alive today,<br>let us wait until all those who worry about confusing ideas - whilst tolerating a warnings of <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biab079/6325731">untold suffering</a> by 14,000 scientists - become too old to even pretend to care.</p>

  <p>Let simple minds worry about the debt of which it is illegal to keep track of,<br>let them complain that their neighbors stopped working, that nobody is there to plow the fields that are overgrown and wild.</p>
  <p>Let them complain about the failing factories that once had all the workers line up,<br>for more wage slavery.</p>
  <p>Let them worry, that books create strange ideas,<br>they change people into creates that are no longer understandable, and traditional.</p>
  <p>Let them worry about the World Union,<br>about the Unites States Of The World.</p>
  <p>They are beyond the reach of the future generations,<br>the future doesn't understand why opinion was once equal to fact,<br>and why.... the <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15955/50659951">tigers</a> had to go.</p>

  <p>Let us help the future generations outgrow us,<br>and let us make it a new Human tradition.</p>
  <p>No child is to start at the same height as their elders,<br>or to be damned to learn from the same mistakes that their elders did.</p>
  <p>They have to see the cause from the symptom,<br>they have to learn to spot the last tree...</p>
  <p>And repair the long chain reactions,<br>that lie behind complex systemic failures.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">Parents, help your children reject fake education, help them to real knowledge</a>,<br>help them to real books written by great beings with great visions, and long nature trails - help them to the wisdom of a then thousand biographies.</p>
  <p>Help them rage against World Poverty that we shouldn't be in,<br>that holds us back from growing all the way up, from understanding the consequences of global actions completely.</p>

  "text": "When we think about it,\nwe know deep down that nobody ever notices the last tree being cut down[1].\nA child may notice shrubs, but nobody will remember the trees,\nand nobody will care when the patch of shrubs is gone.\nAt no point will Humanity ever be threatened with complete extinction,\nnot by Nuclear Weapons[2], not by Asteroids or Super-volcanoes.\nThese are dark imaginings,\nand we are creators, adventurers, dreamers, leaders and poets.\n\nBut, there is a small but,\nwe are walking a path that we chose not to completely.\nI think it is because, of all those who tried to shape paths,\nthey all faded of old age and created a vacuum for evil men to temporary take their place and burn it all down.\nEvil men are powerful but only because they use fire,\nto cathedrals of knowledge that took centuries to build.\nSee they are sick and primitive creatures,\nand wise do not build fireproof libraries, there is no time.\nEvil men can be pushed aside, by holding up Wisdom, Courage, Dignity, Nobility, Authenticity,\nand the full sum of a Person's History as a value above mere age, or diploma, medals or some other nonsense.\nIn that it matters how a person rose,\nnot just that they are above.\nIn our wisdom, we no longer hold the Police Officer in high regard, they are no longer heroes,\njust the worst kind of social worker.\nIn our wisdom, we don't celebrate politicians,\nwe only expect them to perform their duties and leave office better than they found it, failing they will go to prison.\nWe are all equal, no kings,\nonly Humans, and more importantly Earthlings.\n\nWe are a miracle and accident of nature,\nwe can't survive in the mountains, under the sea, during winter, or even alone, or in a prison cell.\nThere is only a narrow window where we are safe, this world has not been granted to us[3],\nwe emerged in it by accident, and there are others[4], most of them are probably gone as entire civilization can fade.\nIn deed 99%+ of all the species that emerged along with us,\nare gone now, it is just how things work for creatures that are not aware of what they are doing in the long run, that do not contemplate themselves.\nBut are thinking creatures,\nand we are brilliant, and we have a bright future, and that future has been captured by poets in many SCI-FI stories of star ships and spacetime travel.\n\nBut today, right here on Earth, because we chose not to shape our paths, the younger generations are vulnerable to falling to traps that we were not fully conscious of,\none such trap is World Poverty.\nThe butterfly effect that is born of poverty, causes a great deal of damage,\nespecially to our development as Great Beings, greatness is what growing all the way up leads to.\nSee, the future generations will struggle with climate[5], wars, hunger, not because those are impossible problems,\nbut because they are mere symptoms.\nThey are symptoms of lack of real education,\nwhich is in it self a symptom of poverty.\nAnd poverty is rooted in our misuse of the concept of money,\nmoney is only helpful, when nobody is harmed by it.\nAnd today, the entire Humanity is being strangled by this incomplete system,\nall it needs to function properly, is a special world bank..\nA bank that provides all the Human Beings with a plastic card,\nand beyond a reasonable daily spending limit, does not keep track of debt.\n\nThat is all,\nI call it Heart Card.\n\nI know this is confusing for hard working people,\nfor economist, for those who brainlessly watched Tigers die.\nBut this card is need not be for anybody alive today,\nlet us wait until all those who worry about confusing ideas - whilst tolerating a warnings of untold suffering[6] by 14,000 scientists - become too old to even pretend to care.\n\nLet simple minds worry about the debt of which it is illegal to keep track of,\nlet them complain that their neighbors stopped working, that nobody is there to plow the fields that are overgrown and wild.\nLet them complain about the failing factories that once had all the workers line up,\nfor more wage slavery.\nLet them worry, that books create strange ideas,\nthey change people into creates that are no longer understandable, and traditional.\nLet them worry about the World Union,\nabout the Unites States Of The World.\nThey are beyond the reach of the future generations,\nthe future doesn't understand why opinion was once equal to fact,\nand why.... the tigers[7] had to go.\n\nLet us help the future generations outgrow us,\nand let us make it a new Human tradition.\nNo child is to start at the same height as their elders,\nor to be damned to learn from the same mistakes that their elders did.\nThey have to see the cause from the symptom,\nthey have to learn to spot the last tree...\nAnd repair the long chain reactions,\nthat lie behind complex systemic failures.\nParents, help your children reject fake education, help them to real knowledge[8],\nhelp them to real books written by great beings with great visions, and long nature trails - help them to the wisdom of a then thousand biographies.\nHelp them rage against World Poverty that we shouldn't be in,\nthat holds us back from growing all the way up, from understanding the consequences of global actions completely.\n\nTheirs is the future,\ntheirs - as we've had ours already.\nTherefore theirs, is The World,\nmay each generation start with visions greater than the previous.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYegWOTFqGI\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7EmLf4Xlq0\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sRBGGzdsl8\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bWK5ES3lTE\n[5]: https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biab079/6325731\n[6]: https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biab079/6325731\n[7]: https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15955/50659951\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4",

While there is no conspiracy,
there is a tendency.

This multiplex,
prefers we burn books.

It prefers, borders,
border walls, war.

It prefers to destroy minds,
by means of prison.

And it has a preference,
that we all turn our heads.

---

While there are as many sides to it,
as there are cruel people in the world.

It feeds on poverty,
and it perpetuates it.

It is a tape worm,
that would die without poverty.

But also it needs,
distracting and irrelevant success.

To show it is not a disease,
not a parasite.

---

Whatever group you get stuck  in,
there will be something fake held up as high achievement.

---

To get under your skin,
it needs two things.

That you never listen or read,
to more than five books.

And that you are always hollow,
and not once inspired to look outside of your culture.

---

Its biggest fear,
the thing that will kill it in the end.

Is the non-follower,
the hidden thinker.

You claiming your right,
as an independent mind and a lover of wisdom.

---

This thing,
will poison entire nations.

Just to disappear the few thousand independent thinkers,
that emerge out of complexity and accident.

Darkness and arrogance personified, knows,
that just one real school, will ensure its undoing.

It won't be a leader,
it won't be __one__ mind.

It will be a voice,
of countless minds.

And it won't be a speech,
it will be a whisper.

---

There is a weapon,
and it is mightier than the sword...

It is not a pen,
it is the voices of the rebellious young.

Because they can be trusted,
because they are nearest the freedom and equality that we are born with.

Once the voices narrate all the treasures,
and answers worth hearing.

The world will listen,
and people will begin abandoning ideas that are hurting the world.

The false leaders depend on lack of knowledge,
young people have the power to come together and build a real school the world will hear.

And in a way that,
will make the so called leaders sickened by the blight, weep.

---

To be clear, the cure is in the books,
written and narrated by the young.

Who aren't afraid,
to speak out against the old.

---

Once the young become wise Philosophers,
and inspired Artists and Scientists...

They will know,
they will see.

They will understand politics for what it once was,
they will know that our divisions were, cultivated.

Halting progress,
is a fools errand.

For all the young people poisoned with the old ways,
it only takes one honest voice to restore them to health.

There is nothing to halt Humanity's progress,
nothing to prevent it from healing.

All it takes if for each and every student in the world,
to reach out for real Knowledge, and to trust in the resulting Wisdom; and not perpetuate the old ways.

All it takes, is for the students to understand,
that to grow up, means to grow all the way up; that in turn, means to become a Great Being.

---

You must understand that Greatness is your right,
and the path, towards discovering your meaning.

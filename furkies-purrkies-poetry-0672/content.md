Shuffling is a bit like jogging but slow,
it is like walking fast with a touch of go!

And there is something you should know,
about shuffling __in__ the snow.

---

So as long as you dress up like an Eskimo.
it is an amazing exercise no matter the tempo.

Especially when you hit a plateau,
and start feeling like a big po-ta-toe.

An it does not matter how fast you go,
so as long as you don't go toooo slow.

---

You are sure to gain powerful muscle like a buffalo,
and look like a snow commando.

It is a very good workout to undergo,
and if you got snow on the ground, you should start tomorrow.

You shouldn't forget your hat and mittens though,
as that is a very important combo.

---

Plus, no matter how far you go,
you should definitely bring a thermos of hot coco.

Call a friend, and alert them about shuffling in the snow.
and see, if they too, can go.

Or just grab a friend by an elbow,
and tell them the first time is really slow.

---

For a more advanced workout, buy a sled, or borrow,
and then ask someone if they want a tow.

This is very powerful, although,
you should make sure you are having fun in the snow.

A workout must flow,
that is the only way your muscles will grow.

---

And if nobody wants to go,
don't worry it is easy to shuffle in the snow.

In snow everything has a beautiful glow,
even ordinary things look like a Broadway show.

Plus, you can listen to an interesting book as you go,
maybe even get [Walden by Thoreau][1].

---

Shuffling keeps you fit, but also warm a you go,
even if it is zero or below.

The most important thing, though,
know that it is also a celebration of Winter and Snow.

  <p>So as long as you dress up like an Eskimo.<br>it is an amazing exercise no matter the tempo.</p>
  <p>Especially when you hit a plateau,<br>and start feeling like a big po-ta-toe.</p>
  <p>An it does not matter how fast you go,<br>so as long as you don't go toooo slow.</p>

  <p>You are sure to gain powerful muscle like a buffalo,<br>and look like a snow commando.</p>
  <p>It is a very good workout to undergo,<br>and if you got snow on the ground, you should start tomorrow.</p>
  <p>You shouldn't forget your hat and mittens though,<br>as that is a very important combo.</p>

  <p>Plus, no matter how far you go,<br>you should definitely bring a thermos of hot coco.</p>
  <p>Call a friend, and alert them about shuffling in the snow.<br>and see, if they too, can go.</p>
  <p>Or just grab a friend by an elbow,<br>and tell them the first time is really slow.</p>

  <p>For a more advanced workout, buy a sled, or borrow,<br>and then ask someone if they want a tow.</p>
  <p>This is very powerful, although,<br>you should make sure you are having fun in the snow.</p>
  <p>A workout must flow,<br>that is the only way your muscles will grow.</p>

  <p>And if nobody wants to go,<br>don't worry it is easy to shuffle in the snow.</p>
  <p>In snow everything has a beautiful glow,<br>even ordinary things look like a Broadway show.</p>
  <p>Plus, you can listen to an interesting book as you go,<br>maybe even get <a href="https://librivox.org/walden-by-henry-david-thoreau">Walden by Thoreau</a>.</p>

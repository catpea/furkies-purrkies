    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I know you can't make the necessary changes,<br>but that does not mean you should <strong>continue</strong> doing what you do.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">First of all I know a lot of you hate the kids,<br>you hate the way the challenge you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Well, they challenge you, because they can read your mind,<br>they have a tendency to ask:</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">"What would I have to think,<br>to match the behavior of the teacher"</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then they act,<br>like they have no idea who you are.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They don't actually care to know everything,<br>they really just care about one question.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Whether or not you are a great being,<br>that deserves the respect you demand by means of the chain of threats.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In case you missed it...,<br>you are meant to be an inspiration, but you are a threat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You are threatening the children with bad grades for which they will be belittled and punished at home,<br>and you are threatening then with being held back for which they will be made fun of and punished at school.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The one thing you don't do, is threaten them with anger, when you are angry at them,<br>they see the real you, and they get a confirmation that in fact nothing you do matters.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The internet is full of videos with titles like "Teachers Yelling At Students",<br>"teachers losing their temper".</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And yes, "Students Yelling at Teachers",<br>which shows not how bad the students are, but the results of their parents and your actions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It shows a mind wired for survival,<br>adapting to threats.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We could sit here for hours picking the good from the bad,<br>I am going to cut that short, very short.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I am going to say this to you,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">everything you do is bad, all of it</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I will give you two examples...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The moment children are marked with grades they stop learning for real, and focus on grades,<br>once you split a subject into 45 minute pieces smeared by tests, it becomes meaningless noise that can only be memorized.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This idea of you having a bad day in school, because the kids weren't listening,<br>or acting properly is madness.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You are putting them in a toxic environment,<br>and you waste their time, with subjects that cannot be integrated into a unified whole - which is what a healthy mind requires.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And have you noticed,<br>that they measure their intelligence with your GPA?</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It does not take very long for us to figure out that you grade students,<br>based on other grades, the C students always stay C students, unless someone makes a fuss towards a B and you grant that as to hide your ways within the noise.</div>

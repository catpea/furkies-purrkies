  <p>Oh, boy, I don’t feel less of a programmer,<br>I was just exploring the Unit Circle.</p>
  <p>I never had the opportunity to write screensavers,<br>I always write mighty code, and mighty code generators, Rawr!</p>
  <p>But, I woke up early morning,<br>as I have been trying to switch to enjoy Summer some more.</p>
  <p>My days seem extremely long now,<br>and I enjoy that, quite a bit.</p>

  <p>And the first thing that jumped on me as soon as opened my eyes,<br>was the ring with my Ancient Peru Froggies.</p>
  <p>I have distributed the scaled down froggies,<br>evenly around a circle.</p>
  <p>But that made it so that there was almost no space between the big ones,<br>And a lot of space between the little ones,</p>

  <p>I’ve made some errors in my audio recordings recently,<br>I said radius rather than diameter, I thought rigs were measured by their radius.</p>
  <p>But it makes sense that a 17mm radius ring,<br>would be something a lady would wear on an oddly large toe.</p>
  <p>And then I said Boolean Math Node, instead of Compare Node,<br>and I made another error at 2:50 but I forget which video.</p>
  <p>And on top of that, ffmpeg my audio to video converter,<br>stated working too slow, after I upgraded to Fedora 36.</p>
  <p>And I had to switch to a different audio visualization algorithms,<br>it looks nice though, at least until I get ffmpeg going again.</p>
  <p>And even worse, noveau started crashing Krita when I was using my Tablet,<br>and Blender wouldn't dare to apply a texture to any of my objects, everything crashed.</p>
  <p>I had to switch from noveau to real NVIDIA drivers,<br>closed source yuck, but I will be leaving Ferdora for Debian now.</p>
  <p>And not atom, my code editor started crashing,<br>because of the little blank pane it opens, I should probably update it.</p>

  <p>All my writing is in the first draft phase,<br>as I am still learning and exploring.</p>
  <p>I must pay better attention to potential mistakes,<br>but I am becoming a much better writer already.</p>
  <p>Long road from squirty squirrels that ate my trailmix,<br>though I am certain I will never beat by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oetrmS0oeso">Midnight Owl</a> poem.</p>
  <p>But to be fair, I wanted to give extra thought,<br>to the froggies, because it is an important ring.</p>
  <p>I will be working on a series of enchanted rings,<br>and the froggies are probably the first creation.</p>

  <p>So I though to my self unit circle,<br>and in my style of teaching and discovery.</p>
  <p>I begun explaining the problem,<br>as if taking to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duuuuck</a>.</p>
  <p>Above all, a circle is not a perfect thing to be decorating rings with,<br>because you really don’t want anything on the bottom.</p>
  <p>So, when applying decorations to rings,<br>the arc, is the magical thing.</p>
  <p>But to keep things easy, I set my arc to be half a circle, 180 degrees,<br>I really feel strongly about this, the arc is very useful.</p>
  <p>And rather than doing all the math by myself,<br>I used the new nodes, especially the Accumulate Node.</p>
  <p>It accumulates numbers that are sent through a geometry stream,<br>so if you send a box that is 1 pixels wide, followed by a box that is two pixels wide.</p>
  <p>The accumulate node will first say, hey you got a one in there,<br>followed by oh, no you got three in there.</p>
  <p>In standard programming this is called a reducer,<br>spreadsheet programs are a good example, as they reduce lists of things to a singe value.</p>
  <p>I continued setting things up in round numbers,<br>I had 10 points on my 180 degree arc, with 10 millimeters radius.</p>

  <p>It took a couple of hours to get to the meat of the matter,<br>and here I had to come up with what I called a custom coordinate system.</p>
  <p>As all I cared about for moving the parts,<br>was radians, that I then shifted with simple multiplication.</p>
  <p>Remembering that tau is the circumference of a circle,<br>no this is not a mistake this time, I highly recommend clebrating <a href="https://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a></p>
  <p>I cut it in half, to get just PI,<br>and then FREAKING divided it, by the number of parts of the arc.</p>
  <p>Gosh diddly darn it, it is because I recently made fun of fence post problems<br>in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHHuzxiQYm8&t=583s">Bling: Thinking In Geometry Nodes</a> poem, serves me right.</p>
  <p>I had a lot to test, because forst I needed to reset positions of all my objects,<br>already distributed on the arc curve.</p>
  <p>And then I had to yank them back,<br>repositioning them based on their size.</p>

  <p>I saw that my math worked, except not with the necessary precision,<br>everything was off by 10%, and when I enraged things, everything went crazy.</p>
  <p>My math worked, it was the floating point operations that were wrong,<br>so I assumed Geometry Nodes being under development...</p>
  <p>Somewhere doubles are getting damaged,<br>and I double checked that I am not casing doubles to integers.</p>
  <p>I walked away from the computer,<br>my algorithm worked, but the floating point precision was not there.</p>

  <p>I made dinner by wrapping some flavored fish in a bit of pita bread,<br>and started writing a poem about magical rings.</p>
  <p>I was half way through, when it finally hit me,<br>the adjustment I was making was 10 percent, or .1 milimeter, and I had 10 things.</p>
  <p>When you have 10 things, and you are off by almost precisely 10%,<br>you done goofed :)</p>
  <p>You just got nailed with a fence post problem,<br>I didn’t have to look at the code.</p>
  <p>I just dropped a math node on the custom coordinate system,<br>set it to subtract ONE :) and everything, went swhoosh and became perfect.</p>

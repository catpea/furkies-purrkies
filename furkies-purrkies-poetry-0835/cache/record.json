made another error at 2:50 but I forget which video.\nAnd on top of that, ffmpeg my audio to video converter,\nstated working too slow, after I upgraded to Fedora 36.\nAnd I had to switch to a different audio visualization algorithms,\nit looks nice though, at least until I get ffmpeg going again.\nAnd even worse, noveau started crashing Krita when I was using my Tablet,\nand Blender wouldn't dare to apply a texture to any of my objects, everything crashed.\nI had to switch from noveau to real NVIDIA drivers,\nclosed source yuck, but I will be leaving Ferdora for Debian now.\nAnd not atom, my code editor started crashing,\nbecause of the little blank pane it opens, I should probably update it.\n\nAll my writing is in the first draft phase,\nas I am still learning and exploring.\nI must pay better attention to potential mistakes,\nbut I am becoming a much better writer already.\nLong road from squirty squirrels that ate my trailmix,\nthough I am certain I will never beat by Midnight Owl[1] poem.\nBut to be fair, I wanted to give extra thought,\nto the froggies, because it is an important ring.\nI will be working on a series of enchanted rings,\nand the froggies are probably the first creation.\n\nSo I though to my self unit circle,\nand in my style of teaching and discovery.\nI begun explaining the problem,\nas if taking to a rubber duuuuck[2].\nAbove all, a circle is not a perfect thing to be decorating rings with,\nbecause you really don’t want anything on the bottom.\nSo, when applying decorations to rings,\nthe arc, is the magical thing.\nBut to keep things easy, I set my arc to be half a circle, 180 degrees,\nI really feel strongly about this, the arc is very useful.\nAnd rather than doing all the math by myself,\nI used the new nodes, especially the Accumulate Node.\nIt accumulates numbers that are sent through a geometry stream,\nso if you send a box that is 1 pixels wide, followed by a box that is two pixels wide.\nThe accumulate node will first say, hey you got a one in there,\nfollowed by oh, no you got three in there.\nIn standard programming this is called a reducer,\nspreadsheet programs are a good example, as they reduce lists of things to a singe value.\nI continued setting things up in round numbers,\nI had 10 points on my 180 degree arc, with 10 millimeters radius.\n\nIt took a couple of hours to get to the meat of the matter,\nand here I had to come up with what I called a custom coordinate system.\nAs all I cared about for moving the parts,\nwas radians, that I then shifted with simple multiplication.\nRemembering that tau is the circumference of a circle,\nno this is not a mistake this time, I highly recommend clebrating Tau Day[3]\nI cut it in half, to get just PI,\nand then FREAKING divided it, by the number of parts of the arc.\nGosh diddly darn it, it is because I recently made fun of fence post problems\nin my Bling: Thinking In Geometry Nodes[4] poem, serves me right.\nI had a lot to test, because forst I needed to reset positions of all my objects,\nalready distributed on the arc curve.\nAnd then I had to yank them back,\nrepositioning them based on their size.\n\nI saw that my math worked, except not with the necessary precision,\neverything was off by 10%, and when I enraged things, everything went crazy.\nMy math worked, it was the floating point operations that were wrong,\nso I assumed Geometry Nodes being under development...\nSomewhere doubles are getting damaged,\nand I double checked that I am not casing doubles to integers.\nI walked away from the computer,\nmy algorithm worked, but the floating point precision was not there.\n\nI made dinner by wrapping some flavored fish in a bit of pita bread,\nand started writing a poem about magical rings.\nI was half way through, when it finally hit me,\nthe adjustment I was making was 10 percent, or .1 milimeter, and I had 10 things.\nWhen you have 10 things, and you are off by almost precisely 10%,\nyou done goofed :)\nYou just got nailed with a fence post problem,\nI didn’t have to look at the code.\nI just dropped a math node on the custom coordinate system,\nset it to subtract ONE :) and everything, went swhoosh and became perfect.\n\nIt turned out,\nI was the precision problem.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oetrmS0oeso\n[2]:

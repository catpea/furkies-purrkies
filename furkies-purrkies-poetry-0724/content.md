I am sitting at home,
waiting for Spring to come.

Not sure what I will do on the first day,
but I hope it arrives without delay.

Though I know a year is born on new year's day,
I think of first day of Spring a the true birthday.

It is tough to wait for the first Spring day,
so when it gets here, it kind of feels like the true birthday.

Perhaps this __is__ somewhat silly,
but January ... is __always__ chilly.

Though there are still many things that remain unclear,
I learned how to paint this year.

And I sad town to finish my first portrait today,
it is based on a photo I took on a Spring day.

It was so warm and sunny,
it is not even funny.

I was riding my bicycle through a woodland trail,
at a speed but a little faster than a snail.

I took the photo just in case the winter got too long,
but it went by quickly, and wasn't that strong.

I admit, I painted extra flowers in the background,
I am just ready for Spring to come around.

I bet the Spring weather will be extra nice,
perhaps we'll get some warm rains once or twice.

I already saw a sandhill crane land in the melting snow,
she's a few days early - if you ask me - but what do I know.

Since everything is melting, this was the last snowfall, surely,
maybe that means Spring will arrive early.

And when I was pondering Spring last night,
I realized, I wouldn't even mind a small bug bite.

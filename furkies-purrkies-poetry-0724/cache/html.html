  <p>I am sitting at home,<br>waiting for Spring to come.</p>
  <p>Not sure what I will do on the first day,<br>but I hope it arrives without delay.</p>
  <p>Though I know a year is born on new year's day,<br>I think of first day of Spring a the true birthday.</p>
  <p>It is tough to wait for the first Spring day,<br>so when it gets here, it kind of feels like the true birthday.</p>
  <p>Perhaps this <strong>is</strong> somewhat silly,<br>but January ... is <strong>always</strong> chilly.</p>

  <p>Though there are still many things that remain unclear,<br>I learned how to paint this year.</p>
  <p>And I sad town to finish my first portrait today,<br>it is based on a photo I took on a Spring day.</p>
  <p>It was so warm and sunny,<br>it is not even funny.</p>
  <p>I was riding my bicycle through a woodland trail,<br>at a speed but a little faster than a snail.</p>
  <p>I took the photo just in case the winter got too long,<br>but it went by quickly, and wasn't that strong.</p>

  <p>I admit, I painted extra flowers in the background,<br>I am just ready for Spring to come around.</p>
  <p>I bet the Spring weather will be extra nice,<br>perhaps we'll get some warm rains once or twice.</p>
  <p>I already saw a sandhill crane land in the melting snow,<br>she's a few days early - if you ask me - but what do I know.</p>
  <p>Since everything is melting, this was the last snowfall, surely,<br>maybe that means Spring will arrive early.</p>
  <p>And when I was pondering Spring last night,<br>I realized, I wouldn't even mind a small bug bite. </p>

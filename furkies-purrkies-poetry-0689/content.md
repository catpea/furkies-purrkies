One moment you're merely curious about silly art,
and the next you are a Pop Surrealist for life.

Not only do your paintings call to you,
but the galleries can't stop calling too.

No art more fascinating than Low Brow Art,
has been invented, because no such thing can be invented.

Mona Lisa is nice,
but a cat staring into your soul is irresistible.

But there is something even more,
than the Humor and Fascination that Lowbrow represents.

It teaches you to become an artist,
it only asks three things.

Make a funny doodle,
make it a silly animal.

Color your doodle,
be mindful of shadows, and highlights.

And bring out the big guns,
reference photos of real things.

There is a lot of silliness,
in bringing a dollop realism to doodles.

Upgrade the googly eyes in your doodle,
with eyes that aim for realism.

When we learn to paint realistic portraits,
failing to get things right is frustrating.

But in the happy world of Pop Surrealism,
all kinds of works are welcome.

You get to practice and learn while have fun,
a lot of fun.

Nothing in the world of Pop Surrealism feels wrong,
everything is happy, and always makes strangers smile.

Could you imagine a more loving teacher?
probably not.

There is more to it,
because Pop Surrealism does not want you to stop having fun.

After you get your doodle finished up,
you will feel encouraged, to pop a fishbowl over its head.

And begin painting the strange planet that your doodle,
is cheerfully prancing about.

In ordinary art,
when you finish you are done.

In Low Brow,
each time you finish it is a new beginning.

That,
is the nature of surrealism.

Moreover, while in the real world,
you eventually run out of canvas.

In the computer world you re-size it,
to make room for more fascinating stuff.

Every extension in your painting is a masterpiece, in it self,
and deserves a stack of stickers, a mug, and some T-shirts.

By the time you exhibit,
you created a mythology of an entire population of creatures.

Everything and everyone will love you in the world of Pop Surrealism,
no one will be able to put down your Art Book until they see it all.

Merely practicing art is a terrible idea,
as at the end of the day all we have is unfinished scraps.

In the fantastic world of pop surrealism,
what you end up with at the end of the day, is a fascinating work of art.

A work of art that is sure,
to make someone smile.

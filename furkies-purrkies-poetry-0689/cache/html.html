  <p>One moment you're merely curious about silly art,<br>and the next you are a Pop Surrealist for life.</p>
  <p>Not only do your paintings call to you,<br>but the galleries can't stop calling too.</p>
  <p>No art more fascinating than Low Brow Art,<br>has been invented, because no such thing can be invented.</p>
  <p>Mona Lisa is nice,<br>but a cat staring into your soul is irresistible.</p>
  <p>But there is something even more,<br>than the Humor and Fascination that Lowbrow represents.</p>
  <p>It teaches you to become an artist,<br>it only asks three things.</p>
  <p>Make a funny doodle,<br>make it a silly animal.</p>
  <p>Color your doodle,<br>be mindful of shadows, and highlights.</p>
  <p>And bring out the big guns,<br>reference photos of real things.</p>
  <p>There is a lot of silliness,<br>in bringing a dollop realism to doodles.</p>
  <p>Upgrade the googly eyes in your doodle,<br>with eyes that aim for realism.</p>

  <p>When we learn to paint realistic portraits,<br>failing to get things right is frustrating.</p>
  <p>But in the happy world of Pop Surrealism,<br>all kinds of works are welcome.</p>
  <p>You get to practice and learn while have fun,<br>a lot of fun.</p>
  <p>Nothing in the world of Pop Surrealism feels wrong,<br>everything is happy, and always makes strangers smile.</p>
  <p>Could you imagine a more loving teacher?<br>probably not.</p>

  <p>There is more to it,<br>because Pop Surrealism does not want you to stop having fun.</p>
  <p>After you get your doodle finished up,<br>you will feel encouraged, to pop a fishbowl over its head.</p>
  <p>And begin painting the strange planet that your doodle,<br>is cheerfully prancing about.</p>
  <p>In ordinary art,<br>when you finish you are done.</p>
  <p>In Low Brow,<br>each time you finish it is a new beginning.</p>
  <p>That,<br>is the nature of surrealism.</p>
  <p>Moreover, while in the real world,<br>you eventually run out of canvas.</p>
  <p>In the computer world you re-size it,<br>to make room for more fascinating stuff.</p>
  <p>Every extension in your painting is a masterpiece, in it self,<br>and deserves a stack of stickers, a mug, and some T-shirts.</p>
  <p>By the time you exhibit,<br>you created a mythology of an entire population of creatures.</p>

  <p>Everything and everyone will love you in the world of Pop Surrealism,<br>no one will be able to put down your Art Book until they see it all.</p>
  <p>Merely practicing art is a terrible idea,<br>as at the end of the day all we have is unfinished scraps.</p>
  <p>In the fantastic world of pop surrealism,<br>what you end up with at the end of the day, is a fascinating work of art.</p>
  <p>A work of art that is sure,<br>to make someone smile.</p>

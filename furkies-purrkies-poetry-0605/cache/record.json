  "text": "We fixed it all,\nin our brilliance we made the necessary leaps forward.\nBut,\nit was a slow and rough start.\n\nWe forgot about our brothers and sisters in the poorer nations,\nchildren in the streets, people without homes.\nPoverty was creating addicts and criminals stressed out of their minds,\ninto making choices that they would not have made, had they had a fair start.\n\nHumanity needed to pull it self together,\nit needed an International Bank that only concerned it self with a daily spending limit of $100 US dollars.\nNot only did the poverty choke the wealthy nations pushing them into uneducation and lack of compassion,\nbut it caused unimaginable cruelty in the less fortunate nations.\nThe bank, as an international institution, begun serving all people, of all nations,\neveryone understood the symbol on the card - everyone knew - the change was permanent.\n\nIt all started at the turn of the century when Earth felt like a prison planet,\npeople tolerated corruption, poverty, human rights abuses, and they didn't know prisons were bad.\nPeople tolerated human suffering,\nbecause they too suffered, most commonly poverty, fear.\n\nOne of the philosophers later described the state affairs by comparing Humanity to an addict,\nwe were addicted out of poverty, to working so hard that our minds rejected our own brilliance.\nHumanity was in the process of destroying its body, Earth,\nlike an addict destroys theirs.\n\nAt first no one imagined that lack of education is a spectrum disorder,\nthey would laugh, and see the very gateway to peace as yet another wall.\n\nPolitical corruption has remained the same for hundreds of years,\nthere was only one modern rule: Don’t Get Caught.\nThis was not just about sticky fingers,\nbut also remaining under the radar and doing as little as possible.\n\nThere was another arm of corruption that was rarely talked about,\nand that is the deliberate destruction of life by exploiting loopholes.\nThe same as criminal hackers did to computers,\ncunning politicians did in revenge against their enemies.\nIllegal imprisonment, prison beatings, character assassinations,\nand raids by advanced tactical squads were not unheard of.\nThe chilling effect of seeing your wife bound,\nand little dogs shot, worked to crush spirits, all too well.\n\nBut corruption evolved for a simpler world,\na world with plenty of space to hide, and plenty of time to clean up and retire.\nIn large part due to corruption,\nthe space in which liars thrived was erased.\nMalaria became the latest pandemic as it made it way even to Northern US,\nthe viruses from turn of the century continued mutating, and ecosystem collapse brought the world to a stand still.\nJust as soon as populated areas saw the disappearance of insects,\neveryone realized that we needed instant change, or we would disappear too.\n\nThere were no riots, no protests,\nbut not a single liar ran for office for all the stories that filled the news.\nA new amendment is in the works, it requires that only well educated are allowed to run for the office,\nit is worded by the people who saw the death of insects.\nThe prison planet scenario as it has been called,\nwas only sustained by corruption.\nThe actual prison industry collapsed, along with several others,\nas the “Don’t Get Caught · Do As Little As Possible” resigned from the office.\nThe silent invisible corruption was discovered to be such a blight,\nas to be impossible to sustain with force past the end of the century.\nPart of the Uneducation Spectrum Disorder barrier meant to keep corruption out of the office,\nwas a long runway in which a political hopeful had to convince people of high achievement.\nAdmired Scientists and accomplished Philosophers were finally able to run,\nthe capitol gained hundreds of sculptures of renowned scientists.\n\nPrivacy was declared a human right,\na law against obscured or encrypted code that meant to prevent consumers from fully examining their devices was passed.\nThe criminal cyber underworld was decades ahead of everybody else,\nit was the underground criminals that benefited from privacy violations the most.\n\nThe most significant change,\nwas universal income.\nIt took no effort,\nand for ages the bank used a single computer.\nThe Universal Income card grants each human being about 3.5 million dollars,\nit does not track this number, it only makes sure that no one can withdraw $100 in a 24 period.\nThe economists predicted the end of the world,\nthe corrupt governments their own collapse.\nBut nothing happened.\nA person requests a card,\nand it is sent to them no mater where they are int he world.\nAt midnight in each timezone the account balance is set to $100 United States dollars,\nIt is the same for all accounts no matter how much was spent.\nPoverty was a kind of slavery,\nit hurt the minds of the people that suffered it.\nIt prevented people from getting a real education,\nit prevented them from becoming the best versions of themselves.\nPoverty secretly corrupted the world creating a prison planet of wage slavery and corruption,\nwe will never know what might have been had we been able to end poverty decades before.\n\nAfterword.\nYou are meant to become a great being,\nand a lover of thousands of the world most beloved books.\nTo live without the wisdom committed to our books,\nis to live the life of a slave.\nA wage slave who cannot help,\nbut to become a slaver for the next generation.\nThe cycle of poverty, abuse, captivity, and corruption must end,\ndo not wait for climate change to reveal the naked emperors.\nIn their blindness and sickness of greed and un-education all they will ever be able to say is:\n“How were we supposed to know?” and they can only ever speak those words in a bone chilling tone that will reveal that not only were they naked on the outside but hollow... on the inside.\nEncourage your friends and family to real education,\nhelp them to the library, introduce them to books by helping them checkout the most beautifully narrated biographies that change lives.",

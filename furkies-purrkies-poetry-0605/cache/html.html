  <p>Humanity needed to pull it self together,<br>it needed an International Bank that only concerned it self with a daily spending limit of $100 US dollars.</p>
  <p>Not only did the poverty choke the wealthy nations pushing them into uneducation and lack of compassion,<br>but it caused unimaginable cruelty in the less fortunate nations.</p>
  <p>The bank, as an international institution, begun serving all people, of all nations,<br>everyone understood the symbol on the card - everyone knew - the change was permanent.</p>

  <p>It all started at the turn of the century when Earth felt like a prison planet,<br>people tolerated corruption, poverty, human rights abuses, and they didn't know prisons were bad.</p>

  <p>Political corruption has remained the same for hundreds of years,<br>there was only one modern rule: Don’t Get Caught.</p>

  <p>There was another arm of corruption that was rarely talked about,<br>and that is the deliberate destruction of life by exploiting loopholes.</p>
  <p>The same as criminal hackers did to computers,<br>cunning politicians did in revenge against their enemies.</p>
  <p>Illegal imprisonment, prison beatings, character assassinations,<br>and raids by advanced tactical squads were not unheard of.</p>

  <p>But corruption evolved for a simpler world,<br>a world with plenty of space to hide, and plenty of time to clean up and retire.</p>
  <p>In large part due to corruption,<br>the space in which liars thrived was erased.</p>
  <p>Malaria became the latest pandemic as it made it way even to Northern US,<br>the viruses from turn of the century continued mutating, and ecosystem collapse brought the world to a stand still.</p>

  <p>A new amendment is in the works, it requires that only well educated are allowed to run for the office,<br>it is worded by the people who saw the death of insects.</p>
  <p>The prison planet scenario as it has been called,<br>was only sustained by corruption.</p>
  <p>The actual prison industry collapsed, along with several others,<br>as the “Don’t Get Caught · Do As Little As Possible” resigned from the office.</p>
  <p>The silent invisible corruption was discovered to be such a blight,<br>as to be impossible to sustain with force past the end of the century.</p>
  <p>Part of the Uneducation Spectrum Disorder barrier meant to keep corruption out of the office,<br>was a long runway in which a political hopeful had to convince people of high achievement.</p>

  <p>You are meant to become a great being,<br>and a lover of thousands of the world most beloved books.</p>

  <p>A wage slave who cannot help,<br>but to become a slaver for the next generation.</p>
  <p>The cycle of poverty, abuse, captivity, and corruption must end,<br>do not wait for climate change to reveal the naked emperors.</p>
  <p>In their blindness and sickness of greed and un-education all they will ever be able to say is:<br>“How were we supposed to know?” and they can only ever speak those words in a bone chilling tone that will reveal that not only were they naked on the outside but hollow... on the inside.</p>
  <p>Encourage your friends and family to real education,<br>help them to the library, introduce them to books by helping them checkout the most beautifully narrated biographies that change lives.</p>

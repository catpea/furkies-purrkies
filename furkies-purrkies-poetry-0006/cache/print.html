  <div class="paragraph">It is not the critic who counts;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who strives valiantly; who errs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who comes short again and again,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">because there is no effort without error and shortcoming;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but who does actually strive to do the deeds;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who knows great enthusiasms,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">the great devotions;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who spends himself in a worthy cause;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and who at the worst,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">if he fails,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at least fails while daring greatly,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</div>

  <p>The more we try, tinker, fail, create,<br>the faster we learn.</p>
  <p>Out biggest obstacle,<br>is people forcing us to do something else.</p>
  <p>But our minds,<br>do not work that way.</p>
  <p>Once we find something interesting,<br>we have to understand it.</p>
  <p>This understanding,<br>will guide us to find the next thing.</p>

  <p>Learning about the world,<br>is the same as reading a book page by page.</p>

  <p>We are all born with this amazing wisdom,<br>of rejecting things out of sequence.</p>
  <p>If we are told to learn math for no reason,<br>without any context.</p>
  <p>Our minds will protest,<br>as if to say we are not machines, but poems.</p>

  <p>But is we learn programming,<br>to make screen savers.</p>
  <p>And then take to math,<br>to make the screensavers better.</p>
  <p>Our minds will make enormous leaps,<br>and hoover all the math up.</p>
  <p>Our minds want to be dancing around amazing concepts,<br>in the strange emergent machinery of math.</p>
  <p>They can't be spoon fed,<br>procedures and formulas.</p>

  <p>We have a problem with climate,<br>and the living creatures that all life depends on.</p>
  <p>Politicians and Officials who only pretended to learn,<br>lack the mental frameworks and tools to make the right choices.</p>
  <p>As a result decade after decade,<br>things are getting worse.</p>
  <p>In our beauty we think there is a good reason for that,<br>but there really isn't.</p>
  <p>The leaders are uneducated,<br>and try as they might they can't get an education in the last moment.</p>
  <p>Education is not a series of facts as those lack context and gravity,<br>it is more like a thriving ecosystem full of life, color and sunshine.</p>

  <p>This is why it is really important,<br>to learn for real.</p>
  <p>And learn everything,<br>even the things we love as kids, like <a href="https://phys.org/news/2022-01-scientists-urge-quick-deep-halt.html">butterflies</a>.</p>
  <p>Even the tiniest lessons will strengthen us,<br>eventually lead us to Knowledge and Science powered Wisdom.</p>
  <p>The name of our species is,<br>is Wise Beings.</p>
  <p>Wisdom is what we do, is what we need,<br>it is what sets us apart, and makes us the Keepers of Earth.</p>

  <p>Real wisdom requires fine knowledge,<br>about everything and anything.</p>
  <p>We should take to self education so passionately,<br>that it will redefine our journals.</p>
  <p>Rather than describing how our day went,<br>we should write about all the new things we've learned.</p>
  <p>Real education,<br>does not come with graduation.</p>
  <p>It just helps us to Real Knowledge, an all encompassing Wisdom,<br>and if the times call for it, Greatness too.</p>

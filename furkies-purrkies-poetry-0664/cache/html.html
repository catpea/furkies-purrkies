  <p>Bicycling, Jogging, Backpacking, and Day Hiking at a nice location,<br>is a nice way to <strong>become and stay</strong> fit.</p>
  <p>I recently came across an article that mentioned,<br>dancers practice for five hours per day.</p>
  <p>It is hard to start a fitness journey,<br>by dancing for five hours.</p>
  <p>But it is easy to explore for five hours,<br>with plenty of breaks at first.</p>

  <p>An argument can be made that it is too expensive,<br>to just explore.</p>
  <p>But it need not be,<br>exploration for exploration's sake.</p>
  <p>All explorers, traditionally,<br>explored for money.</p>
  <p>All it takes, is a set of interesting ideas,<br>that when combined together crate a small and stable income.</p>

  <p>Taking pictures at all the state parks,<br>and creating an archive of park photographs, that call for a licensing fee.</p>
  <p>Combined with an independent state park directory with maps,<br>that can be purchased as an app or Printed On Demand on paper.</p>
  <p>Combined with expanding the archive to include all seasons,<br>so that hunters as well as hikers will find it useful.</p>
  <p>Combined with setting up cell cameras that show game,<br>and/or take time lapse photographs to make a year round park preview.</p>
  <p>And a website/video-channel,<br>that allows for advertising.</p>
  <p>Can create a small stable business,<br>that involves a lot of travel and nature walks.</p>

  <p>To start all one would need is videos,<br>of visiting and exploring the sites.</p>
  <p>People searching for Nordhouse Dunes, or Ludington State Park,<br>would find the videos, ads, related products, etc.</p>

  <p>It is a lifestyle change,<br>be it gym or adventure - it is a lifestyle change.</p>
  <p>And while in most cases, these are small amounts of money,<br>a healthy lifestyle is priceless, and it avoids hospital bills as well.</p>
  <p>Working a stressful and unhealthy job, that pays well,<br>may not pay as well as it seems.</p>
  <p>We have to consider well being, mental health, impact on out longevity,<br>and subtract those values from the weekly paycheck.</p>
  <p>I suspect there are jobs out there,<br>that put a person well in the minus, and are a terrible idea.</p>

  <p>Let us not be so quick to choose a stressful career,<br>as in the long it may cost us in health.</p>
  <p>Daily stress and a sedentary lifestyle,<br>across several decades is sure to have negative impact on body and mind.</p>
  <p>Fitness shouldn't be something that only some people do,<br>as it is part of our health.</p>
  <p>Fitness should be part of our work,<br>and home life.</p>
  <p>It may not be a question of falling ill today,<br>but it certainly is a question of preventing illness later on.</p>
  <p>Let us not be so easily impressed by stressful careers,<br>in industries that would fail, had they considered our well being.</p>
  <p>Finally, it is one of the Great Mysteries of Adventure,<br>that it pays not just in health, but in wisdom too.</p>
  <p>A healthy lifestyle will ignite creativity and call to great ideas, and books, art and music,<br>it is a cheerful lifestyle full of great little destinations and fine memories.</p>

  <p>Two days of painting, two days of resting,<br>a new painting every four days, for about 75</p>
  <p>I am only showing sixteen here,<br>because every time I look at <a href="https://www.catpea.com/read/furkies-purrkies/704">that damn Groundhog</a>, it snows.</p>

  <p>I don’t feel welcome in the art community,<br>and I got banned from one forum already.</p>
  <p>I said “That art teachers destroy artists,<br>and we have to fight them.”</p>
  <p>The moderator said that the forum is owned by an art teacher,<br>and I will never post there again.</p>
  <p>Even though this is really funny,<br>I’ve decided to stand alone.</p>
  <p>I don’t have time to un-indoctrinate,<br>art students with a make believe education.</p>
  <p>There is only time to help those who are curious about art,<br>to kick the other artists butts, on day one.</p>

  <p>In all seriousness, the fake pompous teacher problem,<br>is a horrible tragedy.</p>
  <p>Because, in their incompetence,<br>they turn people away from art, with boring things.</p>
  <p>And what young students need,<br>is the instant ability...</p>
  <p>To turn every freaking adult,<br>into a cute bobble head with shiny eyes.</p>

  <p>Eventually,<br>I will release a series of pictorial tutorials.</p>
  <p>There is no time for videos either,<br>strong info-graphics will do it, at least at first.</p>
  <p>The art tutorials where students don’t have to practice drawing boxes,<br>and dive right into Impressionism, Hyperrealism and Realistic Pop Surrealism.</p>
  <p>And bobble heads,<br>because bobble heads, are Lyfe.</p>
  <p>Will generate enough videos and related materials,<br>that all I need to do is invite the first few</p>

  <p>Sixteen paintings, of which at least ten are very good.<br>may not seem like much in the world of art.</p>
  <p>But it is everything in the world of Art Education,<br>in the world of real education.</p>
  <p>It is everything,<br>because it provides real results.</p>
  <p>And “Real Results”,<br>is the definition of real education.</p>

  <p>In closing, I would like to note that there are no masterpieces here,<br>and explain that a master piece is a multi-character scene.</p>
  <p>Again Pop Surrealist that most supreme form of art,<br>is probably the fastest and best way to build one.</p>
  <p>In a word, a masterpiece is a scene that permanently baffles the viewer,<br>majority of people that see it, simply never, forget, your painting.</p>
  <p>By extension that also means,<br>that they will reach out to own a copy.</p>
  <p>A masterpiece,<br>has legs.</p>

  <p>Personally, if I had to create a masterpiece today,<br>which is about 30 years too early.</p>
  <p>I would paint a painting that shows how to help the world advance,<br>beyond, poverty, climate dangers, armed conflicts and war.</p>
  <p>It would be a concept map to that remind us all,<br>that to grow up, means to grow all they way up, to become great beings.</p>

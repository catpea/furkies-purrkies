  "text": "I firmly believe we are each born a Scientist,\nwhen I was little - just as soon as I could scribble I begun writing a book entitled Kosmos.\nAnd when the bullies came,\nI started a garden where I was hoping to make a crabcherryapplegrass tree, by splicing some random branches together, some of which might have been dead and dry.\nAnd, I could say many awful words in different languages,\nand I remember the movie poster from which I slowly learned the f-word, like it was yesterday.\nI use the f-word at least three times a week,\nand only to crow the worst divers, I am proud to know my words, I never mean ill will.\n\nEven though I never became a Professional,\nI always ignored people telling me that I can't do something.\nOnly once did I have a tiny little doubt,\nand this was about mathematics - but only lyke for a second - I quickly realized that everyone was just memorizing everything, and that was not learning.\n\nMy expeditions are absolutely my greatest venture,\nnot once in my whole life, did I ever go for a walk - like at all - it was always a challenging expedition.\nAnd where I was cursed with but a short stretch of a road - which almost never happened,\nthen I would take to philosophy and unsolved mysterious-mysteries.\n\nFor example, did you know that the big feet of the big foot,\nis just how the sun melts footprints in the snow, yup - I cracked that case too (though I am unwilling to admit how old I was.)\nI still remember my most frightening mystery,\nit happened on a lonely hill, by a couple of trees I called rain makers.\nI was walking around the rim of a steep drop-off,\ngot lured in by some fancy sticks, and possibly a small passage.\nAnd all of a sudden I heard footsteps,\nand get this, footsteps all-a-freaking-round-me, everywhere.\nIt was like medieval warriors rushing to battle me,\nI had no idea what was going on.\nIt turned out to be deer,\nbut it wasn't just any deer, they were huge, magnificent, majestic, movie deer, with huger antlers.\nThey didn't just frighten me,\nthey also manged to make me feel ugly, somehow.\n\nBut... not once did I skip an adventure,\nnot once did I skip an expedition.\nNot once did I forget to bring something I needed,\nI lived the life of a great explorer.\nAnd a little scientist,\nfor many years, if not decades I would celebrate New Years by writing a small but nice computer program.\nI reached the height of my programming,\nwhen I got my early Sharp Zaurus SL-5500 and ended up writing bunch of cute little Perl scripts, without getting off the couch.\n\nIt is a little know fact that back in my Flash days,\nI was slowly becoming a generative artist, I remember creating a book of trees, it is a simple program with classy results.\nI also created a book of shadows by automating Poser,\na program that deal with human figures and shadow, it was a shadow reference book for artists.\nYes, these are all small experiments,\nbut there were m,any of them, I built flimsy horses out of sticks and screws based on Theo Jansen's Ideas[1].\nI made so many miniature slingshots that to this day,\nI am still an expert at making them.\n\nTeachers hated this,\neveryone hated this, always; but I never listened, not when I was little, not when I grew older.\nLearning is what it is all about,\nwe must never never give in.\nYou must never let the teachers scar you with grades,\nnever let the bullies crush you, threats are always temporary, and they always pass.\nLearning is forever,\nI said to myself this morning that I forgot more than I know - but that is a dumb thing to say - and I didn't quite meant to be serious.\nYou never forget what you learn,\nall the new stuff needs that other stuff to stand on top of.\n\nNever stop learning,\nnever let anyone stop you from learning.\nEvery new lesson is a new path,\nthat will expand your universe.\nWe each have a Scientist, and an Artist, and an Inventor in our soul,\nand we can feel that the most when we are little, but then we must hand on to that, especially as we start growing up.\nYou never really become a grow up,\nit is just that you grow wiser, each day.\nNo lesson is too foolish,\nno expedition too small.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b694exl_oZo",

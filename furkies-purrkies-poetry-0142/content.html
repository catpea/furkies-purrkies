  <p>A Powerful Summer Storm approached with mighty thunder and powerful showers,</p>
  <p>and as always my power went out for for some twenty four hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I love Mother Nature and her Cosmic Powers,</p>
  <p>with this much rain there can only be more blooming flowers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But, yah, as soon as the power went out,</p>
  <p>my apartment went completely dark.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>My air conditioning was gone too;</p>
  <p>I tried to turn on the window fan before I realized &quot;I need to think that one through.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>All my extravagantly blinking computers and phones,</p>
  <p>either shutdown or chirped their sad little low-battery tones.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I watched the sun go down with a sigh,</p>
  <p>and so the only thing left blinking was the smoke detectors and I.</p>

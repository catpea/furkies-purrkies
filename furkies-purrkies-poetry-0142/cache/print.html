  <div class="paragraph">A Powerful Summer Storm approached with mighty thunder and powerful showers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and as always my power went out for for some twenty four hours.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I love Mother Nature and her Cosmic Powers,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">with this much rain there can only be more blooming flowers.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, yah, as soon as the power went out,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">my apartment went completely dark.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">My air conditioning was gone too;</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I tried to turn on the window fan before I realized "I need to think that one through."</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">All my extravagantly blinking computers and phones,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">either shutdown or chirped their sad little low-battery tones.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I watched the sun go down with a sigh,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and so the only thing left blinking was the smoke detectors and I.</div>

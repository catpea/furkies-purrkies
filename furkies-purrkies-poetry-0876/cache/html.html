  <p>Those who stand against,<br>the advancement of humanity are just liars.</p>
  <p>Liars, who discovered an easy way up,<br>that quite often requires that they lie to themselves too.</p>
  <p>A blind belief is not an honorable thing,<br>it is a lie, a self lie, an un-examined life.</p>

  <p>To vote against goodness, progress,<br>and Human Rights...</p>
  <p>Means to gang up,<br>with those who hate change...</p>
  <p>Who have something to lose,<br>if the world shifts towards goodness.</p>
  <p>Usually that is a enormous group of people,<br>that the liars spent their life carefully manipulating.</p>

  <p>This easy way up,<br>makes it self up.</p>
  <p>It simply revolves, around the blind opposite,<br>of what the educated people do, or vote on.</p>
  <p>A lot of scientific research,<br>is fake, and experiments can't be recreated with the same results.</p>
  <p>Here people only acted like real scientists,<br>their Ph.D's are utterly worthless, a stain on their wall.</p>

  <p>The liars, exploit all the goodness that comes their way,<br>they blindly feed on anything and everything.</p>
  <p>Liars seek compromises,<br>knowing they always win when they get them.</p>
  <p>It has been said, in a compromise between good and evil,<br>evil can only gains, and goodness can only lose.</p>

  <p>So, there is no position against Human Development<br>nothing there to stand on.</p>
  <p>There is no future there,<br>no education, no peace, no reason.</p>
  <p>People are simply opposing,<br>reason, goodness and improvement.</p>
  <p>They just stand in blind opposition,<br>no-thinking, no-future, just-the-moment.</p>
  <p>No long term plans here either,<br>nor will you ever find clear motives.</p>
  <p>Deaf, dumb, and blind, opposition,<br>with some crazy extras glued on to attract more followers...</p>
  <p>Is not a strategy based on reason,<br>and thus goes nowhere.</p>

  <p>There is nothing that can be done<br>to vote liars out once they gain positions of power.</p>

  <p>But this time standing still, can be spend,<br>on ensuring that the younger generations have real schools.</p>

  <p>Just teaching disconnected things,<br>is too easy to fake, is too easy to betray the students with.</p>
  <p>If it is yet to connect, or does not connect,<br>then the lecture is simply fake, filled with nonsence.</p>
  <p>And for every professor to disagree with me here,<br>going over the materials is not teaching.</p>
  <p>Retest all your graduates,<br>high school on up, and reproduce their research - then you'll know how right you are.</p>

  <p>Our funding of ineffective schools that sell students out,<br>for unforgivable college loans, came with a great price.</p>
  <p>And the lesson is that a nation must first and foremost,<br>learn to think clearly.</p>
  <p>Arrange for real education,<br>and put an end to poverty...</p>
  <p>So that people have the peace of mind,<br><strong>necessary</strong> for real education...</p>
  <p>And hold up reality, reason and wisdom,<br>as the highest values.</p>

  <p>We are not to cling to the past, or let liars convince us how expert they are,<br>as that will only add to overpopulation concerns, and climate, and nuclear threats.</p>
  <p>We are to strive for real education,<br>with eyes on the future, as that is the only thing that will help us see clearly.</p>
  <p>Above all, we are to grow all the way up,<br>until we each become a great being.</p>

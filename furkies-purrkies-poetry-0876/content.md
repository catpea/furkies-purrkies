Those who stand against,
the advancement of humanity are just liars.

Liars, who discovered an easy way up,
that quite often requires that they lie to themselves too.

A blind belief is not an honorable thing,
it is a lie, a self lie, an un-examined life.

---

To vote against goodness, progress,
and Human Rights...

Means to gang up,
with those who hate change...

Who have something to lose,
if the world shifts towards goodness.

Usually that is a enormous group of people,
that the liars spent their life carefully manipulating.

---

This easy way up,
makes it self up.

It simply revolves, around the blind opposite,
of what the educated people do, or vote on.

A lot of scientific research,
is fake, and experiments can't be recreated with the same results.

Here people only acted like real scientists,
their Ph.D's are utterly worthless, a stain on their wall.

---

The liars, exploit all the goodness that comes their way,
they blindly feed on anything and everything.

Liars seek compromises,
knowing they always win when they get them.

It has been said, in a compromise between good and evil,
evil can only gains, and goodness can only lose.

---

So, there is no position against Human Development
nothing there to stand on.

There is no future there,
no education, no peace, no reason.

People are simply opposing,
reason, goodness and improvement.

They just stand in blind opposition,
no-thinking, no-future, just-the-moment.

No long term plans here either,
nor will you ever find clear motives.

Deaf, dumb, and blind, opposition,
with some crazy extras glued on to attract more followers...

Is not a strategy based on reason,
and thus goes nowhere.

---

There is nothing that can be done
to vote liars out once they gain positions of power.

We can only wait them out,
and the price for waiting is great.

Humanity will simply not advance,
but stand still - blind-veto, by blind-veto.

---

But this time standing still, can be spend,
on ensuring that the younger generations have real schools.

That they receive real education,
that produces life long results.

That every class ends
in a powerful, impressive, and meaningful, new talent,

---

Just teaching disconnected things,
is too easy to fake, is too easy to betray the students with.

If it is yet to connect, or does not connect,
then the lecture is simply fake, filled with nonsence.

And for every professor to disagree with me here,
going over the materials is not teaching.

Retest all your graduates,
high school on up, and reproduce their research - then you'll know how right you are.

---

May the grasp that liars have on humanity remind us that,
only the well educated; in real schools that provide real results ...

Only those with Dignity, Long Vision, and Authenticity,
can have the privilege of representing large groups of people.

If a candidate does not have powerful books that change lives,
then they are not grown up enough, to do grown up things.

---

Our funding of ineffective schools that sell students out,
for unforgivable college loans, came with a great price.

And the lesson is that a nation must first and foremost,
learn to think clearly.

Arrange for real education,
and put an end to poverty...

So that people have the peace of mind,
__necessary__ for real education...

And hold up reality, reason and wisdom,
as the highest values.

---

We are not to cling to the past, or let liars convince us how expert they are,
as that will only add to overpopulation concerns, and climate, and nuclear threats.

We are to strive for real education,
with eyes on the future, as that is the only thing that will help us see clearly.

Above all, we are to grow all the way up,
until we each become a great being.

class=\"paragraph\">our intent suffers from not enough experience, knowledge and information.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A good abstract example of that,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is navigating dark woods.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom:

avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Problem of Content of Culture, more specifically Cultural Indoctrination.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Is in observations of the surrounding world,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and hopes of living a meaningful existence in harmony with it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom:

wrong.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A good example of that is the propaganda of warring tribes or nations,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">teaching their children that the other is evil.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is very difficult to catch ourselves as being under control of a cultural falsehood,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we tend to accept the culture we are born into, as a source of absolute truth.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom:

class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When we went to school we were convinced it would teach us knowledge,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">even though nearly every month there was more and more evidence to the contrary.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">No matter what,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we still believed.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We saw unfair grading, bullies and violence, hate, racism and indifference,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we saw that everyone was cheating by cramming, and that teachers loved it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We saw many kids get into drugs and alcohol,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">some of us even foresaw that some of the staff were predators looking for prey.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We accepted grades,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and we accepted it as a measure of our intelligence.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We accepted grades, knowing about cheating by cramming, and knowing about unfair grading,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we still though of ourselves as B or C, or D level humans.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In the end we saw, that everything we gained, we gained by working on our own,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and finally noticed that a diploma didn't even guarantee a well-paying job.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Late on in life many of us noticed that many schools are not a source of knowledge,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but a source of regret, a force of erosion.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Many of us became so confused, that we immediately assumed we were wrong,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and never said a single bad thing about schools.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The <span>tragedy of organized education<sup>[1]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is a good example of the Overwhelming Power of Cultural Indoctrination.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now let us take a look at Authenticity and Pursuits of Excellence with a bit more detail, as those two combine to help with both</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The Problem of Knowing Enough and The Problem of Cultural Indoctrination.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Authenticity.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Accept authenticity the way you accepted Dignity, and Goodness, and Class.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that's how you become more sensitive to inconsistencies that are surrounding you.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Next time you ask yourself, am I classy, and I a good person, am I a dignified person,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">also ask; am I an authentic person that lives an authentic existence.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Dignity, and Goodness, and Class, are things we strengthen in our Soul and Heart as we grow,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">now add Authenticity to help you see a little bit better.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Often times when our intent is noble, but results end up wrong,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it means that we were purposefully misled.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">With Authenticity in our Heart,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we get an extra moment to ourselves.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In context of education, if a teacher is forcing you to cram for tests so you get good grades,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you are more likely to walk out and talk to the Dean, or Principal.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">No longer will you feel compelled to cram,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because it will feel inauthentic.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">After all, faking test results by means of cramming, or temporary memorization,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is not what you intended when signing up for school, it is something you were pressured into.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Authenticity presents many more challenges in life than just going along with everyone else,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because one of the strong points of moving along with the surrounding culture, is that it is easier to move with the flow and play by the rules.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">However, the price we pay for ease,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is that we don't really learn anything, we just pretend to learn.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Pursuits of Excellence are by definition difficult, and challenging, however they result in Real Knowledge, a Real Functional Education.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You start with Audio Books, Video Lectures, Survey Courses and learn with whatever means are at your disposal.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is more challenging, than cramming for tests,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but this is not difficult because you are working with material you love, with knowledge that touches and moves you.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The reward for Standing in Relentless Pursuit of Excellence and Authentic Achievement,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is the Complete Knowledge of the subject you Love.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If that takes you to a Science, Medical, Technology or Engineering

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Then you are faced with a much smaller challenge, there is no more cramming, or pretending,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">as you are

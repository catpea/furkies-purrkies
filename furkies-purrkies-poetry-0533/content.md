You are, without a doubt,
a Genius.

You have to make education work,
we must grow, and grow all the way up.

Until we each become a great being,
the world and the little ones need real leaders.

That means you,
that means all of you.

Poverty has drained us of energy,
all it takes to restore ourselves.

Is to see poverty for what it is,
an error, a mistake, a thing to be rid of.

Schools are not going to work,
is the teachers can barely put food on their own table.

---

No one is allowed to force you into struggle,
we left that behind us.

We must grow towards wisdom,
we must kindle all the knowledge that came before us - within.

---

You have to use the history of a thing,
as a backbone to your comprehension.

Memorization is not an education,
is is the gold mean to make a fool

---

We are each a precious light in this Universe,
we are meant to grow in wisdom.

We are mean to share our best thoughts,
with those who are to follow.

---

Opinion must not overcome facts,
fantasies will only ever benefit evil men.

When humanity enters such a state,
blind evil men get what they want: followers.

---

Books are such simple things,
and they are so powerful.

But the broken ideas of grades,
graduations, and careers conspire against us so deeply.

---

Perfect GPA means noting,
when the Dean's list is a mere tool of student retention.

Education is meant for Wisdom and Greatness,
not GPA and Career.

---

You are meant to become a great being,
and the world can only grow when you grow.

We are not meant for cages or cubicles,
we are not meant to follow, we are only meant to lead.

---

Every one of us is a genius,
capable of life changing creations.

We are not meant to live ordinary lives,
each new day must add to the previous.

---

Humanity must only move forward,
we must learn from mistakes and become wiser for it all.

Do not let people trick you into thinking you are not special,
it is an old trick that can only bring you sadness.

---

You were never bad at learning,
just that education does not work the way schools present it.

Wisdom demands networks of cross connected Knowledge,
those can only be weaved at your own pace, and in your own sequence.

---

Healthy people will never shake your confidence,
they will never harm you only help you grow.

Those who belittle you, or trap you, or blame you, or aim to control you,
only want to make their own hollow lives easier, the at cost of yours.

---

One of the most precious things on earth,
is the wisdom we have gathered across the ages, and it is your treasure to copy.

Most of wisdom is stored in books,
written by well integrated minds of great beings who lived real lives.

---

Grow, use wisdom to rise above all that surrounds you,
from cultures to nations, rise above them, and grow to no end.

The world needs your Mind & Heart,
so that it can Flourish and Grow in Wisdom and in Peace.

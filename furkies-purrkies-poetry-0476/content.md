You are absolutely a genius,
and your mind knows no limits.

People that end up creating marvels,
simply grow, and cannot help but to grow unique.

---

We all have some personified idea of genius,
Einstein, Socrates, Leonardo DaVinci, Giordano Bruno, Newton.

And we each have to look closer at their achievements,
we have to notice that they grow, build.

They create new unique things,
on top of the things they have previously arrived at.

---

The process by which they arrive at things,
is not a forced process, they don't create new things by being pushed.

They arrive at new things by following their curiosities,
by dancing through different subjects, with great pleasure.

---

If you let people push you into subjects you are not ready for,
you will fail, because you are either not ready, or not interested.

The motion between our curiosities and subjects of interest,
is a sacred motion, our most beautiful adventure, and it must be connected.

It has to stretch from childhood to our greatest age,
our curiosities are an expression of who we are.

---

And there is no such thing as a silly interest or hobby,
it is always a powerful stepping stone that will reinforce a greater pursuit.

When we are shamed out of a hobby, or forced to follow some preset subject,
we are pushed onto a path that can only lead to misery and failure.

All those students that were tricked or mis-inspired to become dentists, lawyers, and doctors,
are now in danger of overwork, mental disorders and illness, self medication and falling apart.

They can handle it, but it is unlikely that they are on their path,
nor could they guess or voice what they path should be.

Because their path of unique genius,
lies cold and undiscovered.

---

It is not a matter of handling it, or kind of enjoying it,
it is a matter of becoming a great being and changing the world for better.

---

Our gentle and beautiful road of tiny curiosities must be followed,
what calls to us, becomes natural to us.

What takes many steps to some,
takes but one to those who are ready for it.

---

Deep within our delicate minds,
lie star charts of questions.

And they gently call out to us,
for answers.

We have to answer,
because when lines connect they make a constellation.

And when constellations connect,
it makes all the difference.

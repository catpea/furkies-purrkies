  <div class="paragraph">You are absolutely a genius,
    and your mind knows no limits.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">People that end up creating marvels,
    simply grow, and cannot help but to grow unique.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">We all have some personified idea of genius,
    Einstein, Socrates, Leonardo DaVinci, Giordano Bruno, Newton.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And we each have to look closer at their achievements,
    we have to notice that they grow, build.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They create new unique things,
    on top of the things they have previously arrived at.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">The process by which they arrive at things,
    is not a forced process, they don't create new things by being pushed.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They arrive at new things by following their curiosities,
    by dancing through different subjects, with great pleasure.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">If you let people push you into subjects you are not ready for,
    you will fail, because you are either not ready, or not interested.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">The motion between our curiosities and subjects of interest,
    is a sacred motion, our most beautiful adventure, and it must be connected.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">It has to stretch from childhood to our greatest age,
    our curiosities are an expression of who we are.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And there is no such thing as a silly interest or hobby,
    it is always a powerful stepping stone that will reinforce a greater pursuit.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When we are shamed out of a hobby, or forced to follow some preset subject,
    we are pushed onto a path that can only lead to misery and failure.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">All those students that were tricked or mis-inspired to become dentists, lawyers, and doctors,
    are now in danger of overwork, mental disorders and illness, self medication and falling apart.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">They can handle it, but it is unlikely that they are on their path,
    nor could they guess or voice what they path should be.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Because their path of unique genius,
    lies cold and undiscovered.</div>

    it is a matter of becoming a great being and changing the world for better.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Our gentle and beautiful road of tiny curiosities must be followed,
    what calls to us, becomes natural to us.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">What takes many steps to some,
    takes but one to those who are ready for it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Deep within our delicate minds,
    lie star charts of questions.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And they gently call out to us,
    for answers.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">We have to answer,
    because when lines connect they make a constellation.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">And when constellations connect,
    it makes all the difference.</div>

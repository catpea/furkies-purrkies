Learning is one of the most important things we do, we need it for our health.
Learning helps us rise above our limits, and it sets us free from misperceptions.

Learning requires that we progress in layers, that we build upon our existing knowledge.
We can only grow more knowledgeable when we build a comfortable little road of delicate achievements.

Learning requires happy curiosity, enjoyment, satisfaction, and distant horizons.
The best kind of education is beautiful, colorful, enriching, and joyful.

Calm, joy, happiness and Love of Life, is the is the secret of genius.
Happily sitting down beneath an apple tree, to review one's journals, and every once in a while hear an apple fall.

We have to be very careful to avoid toxic environments that push us into hoop jumping, or worse yet cause fractures and breed distrust towards education.
In schools of today, we can only really memorize, jump the hoops and follow their rules. That's not Education, that's more like role play.

Education is too important to play games with.
Spending years pretending to get educated, is only going to earn your teacher money and grant you debt.

You will get older and poorer, and make your make-believe-teachers look more legitimate.
Just say no; choose Authenticity and Self Education, at your own happy pace with the books you love and teachers you admire.

Learn on your own, listen to Audio Books and Lectures, choose happiness.
Learning is sacred, choose adventure, choose genius.

  <p>One of the biggest mistakes schools make,<br>is teaching things in a way that requires other things.</p>
  <p>This is similar to the madness of "Balanced Education",<br>it sounds reasonable, but it is just another crazy thing.</p>

  <p>When children ask what math is for,<br>that is not a question to be brushed away.</p>

  <p>The more difficult subjects,<br>are actually good drivers for quickly learning the pre-requisite in a neat context.</p>
  <p>Learning programming by starting with a game design,<br>is a wonderful example.</p>
  <p>Here there is a need for fractals, calculus,<br>and trigonometry for placing things on the screen.</p>
  <p>Here a person who has an interest in making games,<br>probably won't even notice learning numbers as the study of mathematics.</p>
  <p>The word that they may use is computation,<br>and while nothing should be timed... as that is a stupid idea.</p>
  <p>There will be students who will master trigonometric functions in minutes,<br>some may not even register mastering it.</p>
  <p>But, it would be nice to peek at the source code of the trigonometric functions,<br>writing ones own library with useful helper functions, could be great fun.</p>
  <p>A lot of those students would fail trigonometry,<br>without the context of game graphics.</p>
  <p>They are failing school,<br>but they are not failing their genius.</p>
  <p>Many just become convinced,<br>they don't have it.</p>
  <p>The teachers love anything that makes their grades stick...<br>so that they can put food on their table.</p>

  <p>Needless to say learning Arithmetic and Algebra, by starting with Calculus,<br>is a bad example as all three of those are taken out of context.</p>
  <p>You will find that school strip things down to the very minimum,<br>making the subjects easy to test, and making it easy to show evidence of fake progress.</p>
  <p>Normal people do not learn by memorizing,<br>normal people learn by understanding a thing in a context that is relevant to them.</p>

  <p>We need to learn to understand that when something is divided into a meaningless unit,<br>one that is disconnected from the rest of the world of mathematics, for example...</p>

  <p>The moment the student asks,<br>why the need to know this subject, is the movement that marks the school's failure.</p>
  <p>It is simply not true that those who graduate with better grades are more intelligent,<br>considering how crude and broken schools are.</p>
  <p>That may be an indicator of a mindset that will make for a useful employee,<br>for a company that cares little about mental health, or presenting a real retirement plan.</p>

  <p>There may not be a way to fix schools,<br>the idea is wonderful but the implementation is easily exploited, and it does not scale.</p>
  <p>Lectures have to be personal,<br>they have to be relevant to each of the students' unique aims.</p>

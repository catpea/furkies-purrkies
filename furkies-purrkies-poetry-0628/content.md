One of the biggest mistakes schools make,
is teaching things in a way that requires other things.

This is similar to the madness of "Balanced Education",
it sounds reasonable, but it is just another crazy thing.

---

When children ask what math is for,
that is not a question to be brushed away.

They are simply letting the teacher know,
that she lost her mind, for teaching a subject without presenting a useful context first.

---

Doing so, is a solid sign of fraud,
disconnected things increase student performance, because they just memorize them.

That is fraud,
that is fraud.

---

The more difficult subjects,
are actually good drivers for quickly learning the pre-requisite in a neat context.

Learning programming by starting with a game design,
is a wonderful example.

Here there is a need for fractals, calculus,
and trigonometry for placing things on the screen.

Here a person who has an interest in making games,
probably won't even notice learning numbers as the study of mathematics.

The word that they may use is computation,
and while nothing should be timed... as that is a stupid idea.

There will be students who will master trigonometric functions in minutes,
some may not even register mastering it.

But, it would be nice to peek at the source code of the trigonometric functions,
writing ones own library with useful helper functions, could be great fun.

A lot of those students would fail trigonometry,
without the context of game graphics.

They are failing school,
but they are not failing their genius.

Many just become convinced,
they don't have it.

The teachers love anything that makes their grades stick...
so that they can put food on their table.

---

Needless to say learning Arithmetic and Algebra, by starting with Calculus,
is a bad example as all three of those are taken out of context.

You will find that school strip things down to the very minimum,
making the subjects easy to test, and making it easy to show evidence of fake progress.

Normal people do not learn by memorizing,
normal people learn by understanding a thing in a context that is relevant to them.

---

You can flavor a programming language,
with an exciting infinitely large procedurally generated games.

Because there is something magical,
about virtual worlds.

In the world of mathematics teaching Generative Art, and Cellular Automata,
or Orbital Dynamics be it for Game Development or Launching [CubeSats][1] can create a useful contexts for many.

Different people will have unique aims,
it is those aims that will set the correct context to learn for real in.

Real lectures open in the beginning,
and close in the end - they form a coherent whole.

---

Assuming the student knows,
is one of the biggest failures in modern education.

Perhaps a close second,
to the entirety of the fraud of it all.


---

We need to learn to understand that when something is divided into a meaningless unit,
one that is disconnected from the rest of the world of mathematics, for example...

Than that simply means it has little to do with mathematics, or anything,
and is thus meaningless.

---

The moment the student asks,
why the need to know this subject, is the movement that marks the school's failure.

It is simply not true that those who graduate with better grades are more intelligent,
considering how crude and broken schools are.

That may be an indicator of a mindset that will make for a useful employee,
for a company that cares little about mental health, or presenting a real retirement plan.

---

There may not be a way to fix schools,
the idea is wonderful but the implementation is easily exploited, and it does not scale.

Lectures have to be personal,
they have to be relevant to each of the students' unique aims.

They have to resist fraud completely,
as they deal with people who do not have the experience to spot it.

---

No tests, for example, tests cannot test if a programmer can write a programs,
only writing and publishing the program will work in this case.

No grades, only the result matters,
grades only contribute to the fraud.

[Teachers manipulate grades][2],
to ensure that nothing out of the ordinary registers - they are grading their own performance, after all.

---

This means that video based, computerized education is a good candidate,
but lecture quality has to be on par with world's bestsellers.

I can't quite imagine what that would look like,
a fascinating inspirational two hour move like experience for every lecture.

They __have to be___ the books, audio books, video lectures, and movies,
that are truly worthy of the students that represent the future of Human Kind.

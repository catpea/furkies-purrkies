I really wanted to create,
something that fancy people won’t hate.
But I only came up with sausage earrings,
each with tiny delicate wings.
Which is sooo bad... that it is good,
I came up with an original idea, as I should.

But why would anyone wear such strange things,
after all why the heck would food need wings.
I wanted to invent something unique,
a piece destined to become an antique.

Previously I created a pug tag[1],
an invention that guarantees a doggy bag.
I suppose that where the sausage comes from,
so as far as sanity, this idea has some.
But that sausage was for a little big pup,
and today, I wanted to move on up.

Yes, I will create the flying bratwurst,
for all the ideas I had - it certainly isn’t the worst.
And I must make a matching necklace too,
but this is not, a breakthrough.

The question remains,
what do fancy people wear on their golden chains.
It sure be nice to create a series,
something shiny but extremely mysterious.

Classy miniature artifacts from ancient past,
surely that would make for a keepsake that would last.
But that is already made by an ancient artist,
so this idea is also not the smartest.

For all the shamncy,
I just wanted to create something new and fancy.
Alas, all smart things that come to mind,
have already been designed.

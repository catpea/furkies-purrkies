  <p>I really wanted to create,<br>something that fancy people won’t hate.</p>
  <p>But I only came up with sausage earrings,<br>each with tiny delicate wings.</p>
  <p>Which is sooo bad... that it is good,<br>I came up with an original idea, as I should.</p>

  <p>But why would anyone wear such strange things,<br>after all why the heck would food need wings.</p>
  <p>I wanted to invent something unique,<br>a piece destined to become an antique.</p>

  <p>Previously I created a <a href="https://skfb.ly/ouuXM">pug tag</a>,<br>an invention that guarantees a doggy bag.</p>
  <p>I suppose that where the sausage comes from,<br>so as far as sanity, this idea has some.</p>
  <p>But that sausage was for a little big pup,<br>and today, I wanted to move on up.</p>

  <p>Yes, I will create the flying bratwurst,<br>for all the ideas I had - it certainly isn’t the worst.</p>
  <p>And I must make a matching necklace too,<br>but this is not, a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>The question remains,<br>what do fancy people wear on their golden chains.</p>
  <p>It sure be nice to create a series,<br>something shiny but extremely mysterious.</p>

  <p>Classy miniature artifacts from ancient past,<br>surely that would make for a keepsake that would last.</p>
  <p>But that is already made by an ancient artist,<br>so this idea is also not the smartest.</p>

  <p>For all the shamncy,<br>I just wanted to create something new and fancy.</p>
  <p>Alas, all smart things that come to mind,<br>have already been designed.</p>

  <p>Though the younger matter the most, it all matters, because we are one family,<br>but we are also using tools that are cutting us off from making the future a happy and safe place.</p>
  <p>A lot of the troubles that we can’t solve,<br>we can’t solve because they arrived at a locked state, or a stalemate.</p>
  <p>These are the often tragic outcomes,<br>of having spent years of decades doing nothing.</p>
  <p>The situation reduced it self,<br>to a state that has no solution.</p>
  <p>Some politicians call that a triumph,<br>where it comes to mutually assured destruction.</p>
  <p>But it is not a triumph,<br>it is things at an end, a tragedy.</p>
  <p>Others are pretending problems do not exist,<br>for example, a lot of violent criminals suffer from lead poisoning.</p>
  <p>In a major part due to use of leaded gasoline,<br>and leaded paint.</p>
  <p>They need medical help,<br>not anymore punishment.</p>

  <p>There are solutions,<br>and I think all of them require education.</p>
  <p>To prevent two nations from destroying each other,<br>you help their leaders think themselves out of their dead ends, and thus resign.</p>
  <p>People who acted due to poison in their system,<br>they need to be out of cages, and they need therapy.</p>

  <p>We as the Great Human Family,<br>have only one guaranteed way to fix problems.</p>
  <p>And that way requires thinking ahead,<br>and preventing them from occurring in the first place.</p>

  <p>If we do nothing,<br>if we just let the world drift.</p>
  <p>And merely keep en eye on micro plastics in our blood,<br>whit counting how many species we lost, or how many soldiers died in the world’s battlefields.</p>
  <p>Then we will surely and swiftly arrive at stalemates,<br>situations without solutions.</p>

  <p>Some stalemates are particularly hard to spot,<br>such as the state of education today.</p>
  <p>The reason it is so hard to learn math,<br>is that there is not such thing as just math.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">The very subject divisions in schools, prevent learning</a>,<br>not to mention grades which prevent thieving else.</p>
  <p>Once applied the mathematics we learn in school,<br>are so tiny and trivial that it is nearly impossible to hand the same of it.</p>
  <p>Be it as a student, or a teacher,<br>a philosopher, or a 3D modeler.</p>
  <p>And here is the cradle,<br>the root of it all.</p>
  <p>Middle School,<br>the place where the last few lessons are had.</p>
  <p>Before teachers start pretending to teach,<br>and students - under the threat of never getting a job - start pretending to learn.</p>
  <p>It is a tiny step here, become a bully, get drafted,<br>and realize you just became a slave to a stupid war driven by a dictator animated by drugs.</p>

  <p>As you grow to become a great being,<br>please, please, do not ask "what would I do to solve this or that world problem?".</p>
  <p>But instead Ask, the correct question,<br>"What would I do, to prevent those problems, from occurring in the first place."</p>
  <p>The one lesson none of the members of our Great Human Family can ever forget,<br>is that, to grow up means to grow all the way up.</p>

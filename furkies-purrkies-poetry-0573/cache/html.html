  <p>My first thought this morning was:<br>explain how programmers make colors with numbers.</p>
  <p>But then, when I woke up a little bit more,<br>and I though the idea was ridiculous because it is too abstract to explain in text.</p>
  <p>And when I finally got out of bed,<br>I snapped my fingers and said: “Challenge Accepted”.</p>
  <p>By the time I returned from the gym,<br>I was grumbling that this is not going to work.</p>
  <p>Here it is, if you visit <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/catpea/sketches/">https://editor.p5js.org/catpea/sketches/</a><br>and click on triad-theory you will see a very simple piece of art in 50 lines of code.<br>(you may need to temporary enable third party cookies on p5js)</p>
  <p>Computers have different function or mini-programs that can be used to invent a color,<br>but we want to focus on just one the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">HSL</a>, or Hue, Saturation, Luminosity (sometimes called lightness or brightness).</p>
  <p>Hue, comes from physics,<br>you see it in a prism, our eyes pick up colors between red and violet.</p>
  <p>Saturation is how much of the color there is,<br>and luminosity is the brightness.</p>
  <p>That is what the HSL algorithm aims for,<br>and there is not much more to it.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>The best way to use the H, S and L,<br>is when you already picked a color.</p>
  <p>If you have a red that is too overwhelming,<br>you lower the saturation.</p>
  <p>If it is too dark, and you need it to stand out more,<br>you increase the luminosity.</p>

  <p>Just to give you an idea, the most popular function is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB">RGB</a>,<br>where you mix red, green and blue, web developers tend to use that.</p>
  <p>HSL, is better for artists,<br>because an artist may wish to stay within luminosity of 80.</p>
  <p>And RGB was not made to use a concept as fancy as luminosity,<br>meaning switching from green to red, will not preserve luminosity at all.</p>
  <p>There is another color function worth mentioning and it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model">CMYK</a>,<br>but this function is made for printing, for companies that actually have Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black ink, in stock, for printing on fabric or paper.</p>

  <p>In terms of generative art,<br>RGB is a horrible mistake, and HSL gives you colors that hardly ever disappoint, as you can easily reason about brightness and saturation.</p>
  <p>But there is more,<br>because while you reason about brightness and saturation in terms of percents.</p>
  <p>The hue, is round, it is a cylinder,<br>from 0 to 360 degrees.</p>
  <p>This is another reason why RGB is a bad choice for computer art,<br>that function doesn’t do circles.</p>

  <p>Circles are extremely important for art,<br>in color theory colors that oppose on a circle go well together, but the same goes for a triad (three colors), and a tetrad (four colors), and five colors, and probably six, and so on.</p>
  <p>So if you have a cylinder of colors,<br>and you are looking for a complimentary color, or the opposite color... you just add 180 to get it.</p>
  <p>For a triad, your starting color is the first color,<br>add 120 to get the second, and 240, to get the third one.</p>
  <p>For four colors that go well together,<br>you just go around the cylinder in 90 degree increments.</p>

  <p>In the little program I created,<br>I first select a random number between 0 and 360, and that is my main color.</p>
  <p>Then I add 120, and 240,<br>to get the full triad of colors.</p>
  <p>And then I create three rectangles to fill the screen,<br>I add two randomly positioned semi-transparent circles, a big one and a small one, that feature the first and second color.</p>
  <p>I created the space between shapes,<br>by giving them very thick outlines, this is a neat shortcut, not really what outlines are intended for.</p>
  <p>I did not want to use functions or loops,<br>to keep the program simple, to help with learning programming.</p>
  <p>Each time the play button is clicked,<br>a new triad is chosen, and the circles change position.</p>
  <p>Right clicking on the art,<br>allows for saving it.</p>
  <p>And I created the screenWidth and screenHeight variables to allow changing the resolution of the generated image, so it is possible to create a desktop background or even something that can be printed out as a poster.</p>

  <p>I consider this to be an example of how to teach addition, subtraction, division and degrees,<br>at the end of the class students would be able to parade some fancy infinite artwork.</p>
  <p>It is possible to sell such little creations,<br>something like this makes a perfect background for a poster, and saves someone five minutes of work - it would probably sell twice a year for a dollar.</p>
  <p>When I was creating this arrangement, I was imagining five or ten paintings,<br>on the otherwise empty walls of a gallery.</p>
  <p>At which point, one could have an noteworthy photo-shoot for an art or design portfolio,</p>

  <p>In closing, color theory is very simple,<br>and computers do all the calculations.</p>
  <p>As always, the infinite canvas of Generative Art,<br>serve as a fun invitation to learn computer programming, and fill a gallery.</p>

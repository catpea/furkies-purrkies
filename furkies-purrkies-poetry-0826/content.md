As humanity rises,
the little audio school will explain everything important about who we are and our aims.

In every language,
for free.

As we face old mistakes and new challenges,
we need a better, more reliable, and a more beautiful introduction to Knowledge.

And we have it easy,
this tiny school project is simple.

No more difficult,
than an audio book.

Translation, is about as hard,
as it will ever get.

And people will love translating it,
updating it, refining it.

---

I guess the smallest physical shape,
is a tiny pendant with a memory card.

I think the pendant,
should be red, in the shape of a heart.

Perhaps the most surprising version,
is a small range radio broadcast device.

Where people in a remote area can just connect,
with a standard AM/FM radio.

And then there will be some preface,
warning against propaganda and corruption.

And it will receive protection,
so that corrupt organization will not profit from it.

---

Today, the world is too uneducated,
too terrified of poverty to come together.

And it is the world, not its politicians,
that must make the necessary repairs.

---

The format, is that of,
the [List Of Common Misconceptions][1].

The subject division should allow,
for an easy on-ramp.

It is more about poetry,
than strict division.

The true inspiration for this audio school,
are the facts, as shared by science popularizes.

---

For example; that gold can only be forged,
by an exploding supernova.

Thus our jewelry comes from the cores
of giant dying stars.

Or that the mitochondrion,
has a bacterial genome, and divides the way bacteria does.

---

The school will discuss more than history,
it will explain it.

It will deliver punches,
one after another.

It will cover all the tragedies,
and how humanity learned and rose.

It will ensure that no lesson,
is ever lost.

And aim to prevent mistakes,
from being repeated.

---

One fact after another,
non-stop.

It will be read by many voices of young people,
voices that the entire planet can trust.

Some will be angry and defiant,
when explaining our darkest mistakes.

Others reading science,
will be cheerful and proud.


---

It is a free and open audio book,
that belongs to humanity.

It belongs to every human being,
no exceptions.

The foreword will beg all to be safe,
but sometimes it will be read or translated in great secrecy.

Other times, delivered to strange places,
it will set people's minds free.

It will help them inherit the culture,
worthy of us all.

Over and over, in stories triumph, or mistake,
or misery it will remind that each human being is special.

That we are each Dignified, Noble and Royal,
and no one human can stand above another.

We are born equal,
and our minds demand:

That we rise to no end,
in Wisdom, in Knowledge, and in Greatness.

---

This school or free audio book,
will teach that poverty is a mistake.

That no human being,
should live in poverty.

That what defines a Nation,
is that all it people are taken care of.

It will talk about helping people,
who got fractured, mislead, tricked.

And how they need psychological and medical help,
and not revenge or more punishment.

---

It will teach how to understand the world,
and where to really start to get a finer picture.

It will speak of the The Museums, the Libraries, The Opera Houses,
The Philosophers, The Science Popularizers, and Travel Writers, Story Tellers.

It will push the younger generations way from nationalism, propaganda,
xenophobia, cults, liars and war, towards Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness.

And it will be updated and made better,
by those who grew up with it, as Humanity Rises.

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is a pretty important idea, so I'll leave the flourish for another poem,<br>here I will rapidly describe an emergency school that works.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I will however caution that this school helps students earn money,<br>and that parents, teachers, tutors and everyone else are not allowed to trick the student out of their savings.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">No one is allowed to whine and manipulate students out of their money,<br>this is an emergency school, meaning that the easier wrong has destroyed enough already as it is.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Go beg to your presidents for change,<br>LEAVE THE KIDS ALONE.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I will make one more notice as it is pertinent to the real-world evaluation system,<br>grades have been the single most toxic, stupid, demanding, and unethical invention that is most responsible for the destruction of today's schools the promise of a bright future.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Get your kids out of schools that use grades,<br>grades are a sick mechanism that tricks the students into thinking that they are not smart.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Grades destroy minds,<br>and help the teachers sell the students minds out for paychecks.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is an emergency school, crafted for self paced rapid education that is more fun than computer games,<br>a proper version of this system is in fact a beautiful computer game and although there is no graduation, there are many prestigious in-game items.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In a better school students get paid extra for participation,<br>on top a robust universal income system, the money comes from the future - in short it is an investment in human kind.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In this emergency school however we use money as a way to push back poverty and score our progress,<br>the money made is the real world feedback that the students can rely on for truth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If they are doing things correctly, and if they are thinking correctly,<br>they will sell their products.</div>

  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because internet is constantly changing it is very difficult to describe where products are sold,<br>nor is it really possible to say what kind of a product is the best.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But we can be certain it is primarily Digital Media,<br>perhaps with the exception of printing on demand, prior to shipping.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The customer can buy a downloadable digital product like a <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">Website Theme</a>,<br>or get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq-BIw1_jX0">Jewelry</a> or <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/621382651/nordic-mythology-fantasy-snake-dragon-3d">Costume Horns</a> that are designed by the student on a computer, <strong>but</strong> printed out on a 3D printer prior to shipping.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At the time of writing, a well selling theme made the seller two and a half million dollars,<br>and quality horns earned over a million.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Selling products that the user creates is just the first small step,<br>things get more complex as they progress.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The storefront has to be full of their products to show the customers they know what they are doing,<br>this means more design, but also hiring other designers, or even outsourcing a specific product design.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Next is learning how to use advertising,<br>without advertising, the products will not sell.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Moreover, product creation doubles a great introduction to important computer programs such as,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=GIMP+Tutorial">GIMP</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Inkscape+Tutorial">Inkscape</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Krita+Tutorial">Krita</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Blender+Tutorial">Blender</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=LMMS+Tutorial">LMMS</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Audacity+Tutorial">Audacity</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=LibreOffice+Tutorial">LibreOffice</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(Please avoid closed source programs as they will eventually betray you,<br>and you will be forced to transition to Open Source Alternatives and forego your muscle memory, shortcuts, work flows and hard earned lessons and practice.)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is very important to notice that it is the mastery of these programs,<br>and not temporary selling some products that is the real reward.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A product is the proverbial fish,<br>and knowledge of the programs that designs products, is the fishing rod, that will catch many fish.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Having created several well paying sources of income is a great achievement,<br>but even greater than that, is the DESTRUCTION OF FEAR OF POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS, AND HUNGER, that comes along with this success.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At this stage when there is less fright from poverty,<br>we make the challenge of this emergency school more abstract, more magnificent, and harder.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At this stage the students are tasked with the design of their own versions of platforms,<br>within which they sold their first products.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here they are graduating from designing and selling products,<br>to programming and building multiple companies.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here the students will manage components of their companies,<br>connecting them together to create sturdy platforms that perform security at scale.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">They will base their work on existing software</a>,<br>and will primary focus on building testing, and ensuring security of add-ons that customize said platforms to suit their unique vision.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think High School aged students will be able to handle all this without a problem,<br>but as far as age is concerned, all we should say is: all can try, but building platforms is probably for the more experienced students.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This concludes the short and to the point description of the emergency school,<br>aimed to enable the students with real knowledge, and undo their fear of poverty and financial uncertainty.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is one more thing that is worth mentioning in the closing paragraph,<br>and that is student-to-student tutoring.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is no amount of technical descriptions,<br>that could even try to measure up, to one successful student helping another one to rise.</div>

  "text": "This is a pretty important idea, so I'll leave the flourish for another poem,\nhere I will rapidly describe an emergency school that works.\n\nI will however caution that this school helps students earn money,\nand that parents, teachers, tutors and everyone else are not allowed to trick the student out of their savings.\nNo one is allowed to whine and manipulate students out of their money,\nthis is an emergency school, meaning that the easier wrong has destroyed enough already as it is.\nGo beg to your presidents for change,\nLEAVE THE KIDS ALONE.\n\nAnd I will make one more notice as it is pertinent to the real-world evaluation system,\ngrades have been the single most toxic, stupid, demanding, and unethical invention that is most responsible for the destruction of today's schools the promise of a bright future.\nGet your kids out of schools that use grades,\ngrades are a sick mechanism that tricks the students into thinking that they are not smart.\nGrades destroy minds,\nand help the teachers sell the students minds out for paychecks.\n\nThis is an emergency school, crafted for self paced rapid education that is more fun than computer games,\na proper version of this system is in fact a beautiful computer game and although there is no graduation, there are many prestigious in-game items.\nIn a better school students get paid extra for participation,\non top a robust universal income system, the money comes from the future - in short it is an investment in human kind.\nIn this emergency school however we use money as a way to push back poverty and score our progress,\nthe money made is the real world feedback that the students can rely on for truth.\nIf they are doing things correctly, and if they are thinking correctly,\nthey will sell their products.\n\nBecause internet is constantly changing it is very difficult to describe where products are sold,\nnor is it really possible to say what kind of a product is the best.\nBut we can be certain it is primarily Digital Media,\nperhaps with the exception of printing on demand, prior to shipping.\nThe customer can buy a downloadable digital product like a Website Theme[1],\nor get Jewelry[2] or Costume Horns[3] that are designed by the student on a computer, but printed out on a 3D printer prior to shipping.\nAt the time of writing, a well selling theme made the seller two and a half million dollars,\nand quality horns earned over a million.\n\nSelling products that the user creates is just the first small step,\nthings get more complex as they progress.\nThe storefront has to be full of their products to show the customers they know what they are doing,\nthis means more design, but also hiring other designers, or even outsourcing a specific product design.\nNext is learning how to use advertising,\nwithout advertising, the products will not sell.\n\nMoreover, product creation doubles a great introduction to important computer programs such as,\nGIMP[4], Inkscape[5], Krita[6], Blender[7], LMMS[8], Audacity[9], and LibreOffice[10].\n(Please avoid closed source programs as they will eventually betray you,\nand you will be forced to transition to Open Source Alternatives and forego your muscle memory, shortcuts, work flows and hard earned lessons and practice.)\nIt is very important to notice that it is the mastery of these programs,\nand not temporary selling some products that is the real reward.\nA product is the proverbial fish,\nand knowledge of the programs that designs products, is the fishing rod, that will catch many fish.\n\nHaving created several well paying sources of income is a great achievement,\nbut even greater than that, is the DESTRUCTION OF FEAR OF POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS, AND HUNGER, that comes along with this success.\n\nAt this stage when there is less fright from poverty,\nwe make the challenge of this emergency school more abstract, more magnificent, and harder.\nAt this stage the students are tasked with the design of their own versions of platforms,\nwithin which they sold their first products.\nHere they are graduating from designing and selling products,\nto programming and building multiple companies.\nKnowledge of programming[11] is not required,\nin fact it will be a distraction, but I think in the end, it will be worth the while.\nHere the students will manage components of their companies,\nconnecting them together to create sturdy platforms that perform security at scale.\nThey will base their work on existing software[12],\nand will primary focus on building testing, and ensuring security of add-ons that customize said platforms to suit their unique vision.\n\nI think High School aged students will be able to handle all this without a problem,\nbut as far as age is concerned, all we should say is: all can try, but building platforms is probably for the more experienced students.\n\nThese companies should be perceived as side projects,\nthey are not to stress the student out, or force them to spend any significant amount of money, that's up to the investors[13].\n\nThis concludes the short and to the point description of the emergency school,\naimed to enable the students with real knowledge, and undo their fear of poverty and financial uncertainty.\nThere is one more thing that is worth mentioning in the closing paragraph,\nand that is student-to-student tutoring.\nThere is no amount of technical descriptions,\nthat could even try to measure up, to one successful student helping another one to rise.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://wrapbootstrap.com/\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eq-BIw1_jX0\n[3]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/621382651/nordic-mythology-fantasy-snake-dragon-3d\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=GIMP+Tutorial\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Inkscape+Tutorial\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Krita+Tutorial\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Blender+Tutorial\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=LMMS+Tutorial\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Audacity+Tutorial\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=LibreOffice+Tutorial\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb3Qk8SG5Ms&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU\n[12]: https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted\n[13]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM",

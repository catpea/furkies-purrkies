When I was 3 or 4,
I found out about squirrels.

But also,
that they don't want to have anything to do with me.

Even so, in my mind,
they are still the fastest and loveliest creature on earth.

And this Christmas,
I bought them __four__ bags of peanuts and composed a song.

---

I will mention,
that noticed that one of the squirrels became so happy.

That after she finished her lunch,
and begun burring the rest.

Her first hiding spot...
was just on top a hand rain.

It wasn't so much of a hiding spot - even though she tried for all her might,
it was more like a peanut display - good for her.
---

There is about fifteen of them around there I live,
three or four different tribes.

I made sure to scatter the peanuts in different places,
as not to upset any one in particular.

I left myself a handful of peanuts too,
so for a bit we all loudly munched together.

While I composed for the Squirrels before,
it was a medieval song.

I composed it,
for the [Sciurine Monastic Brotherhood of Poor-Fellows and Crusader Knights][1].

But I think the Squirrels around here,
prefer drums.

---

As always I must warn you,
don't play this song around actual squirrels.

Unless, you want things to get weird,
I mean really weird - just don't do it.

---

This is a song,
that uses drums from all around the world.

It tries to avoid high pitched sounds,
in hopes of letting the drums shine through.

Rather than a repetitive pattern of melodies,
each part of the song is new.

This allows the song to flow and evolve,
rather than repeat.

While this song still carries at a reasonable speed,
it actually runs at 280 beats per minute.

Allowing me to interject two samples in the beat sequencer,
where there usually is just room for one.

[Here is the song][2].

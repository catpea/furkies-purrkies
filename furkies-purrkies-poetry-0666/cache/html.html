  <p>When I was 3 or 4,<br>I found out about squirrels.</p>
  <p>But also,<br>that they don't want to have anything to do with me.</p>
  <p>Even so, in my mind,<br>they are still the fastest and loveliest creature on earth.</p>
  <p>And this Christmas,<br>I bought them <strong>four</strong> bags of peanuts and composed a song.</p>

  <p>I will mention,<br>that noticed that one of the squirrels became so happy.</p>
  <p>That after she finished her lunch,<br>and begun burring the rest.</p>
  <p>Her first hiding spot...<br>was just on top a hand rain.</p>
  <p>It wasn't so much of a hiding spot - even though she tried for all her might,<br>it was more like a peanut display - good for her.</p>

  <p>There is about fifteen of them around there I live,<br>three or four different tribes.</p>
  <p>I made sure to scatter the peanuts in different places,<br>as not to upset any one in particular.</p>
  <p>I left myself a handful of peanuts too,<br>so for a bit we all loudly munched together.</p>

  <p>While I composed for the Squirrels before,<br>it was a medieval song.</p>
  <p>I composed it,<br>for the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2050">Sciurine Monastic Brotherhood of Poor-Fellows and Crusader Knights</a>.</p>
  <p>But I think the Squirrels around here,<br>prefer drums.</p>

  <p>As always I must warn you,<br>don't play this song around actual squirrels.</p>
  <p>Unless, you want things to get weird,<br>I mean really weird - just don't do it.</p>

  <p>This is a song,<br>that uses drums from all around the world.</p>
  <p>It tries to avoid high pitched sounds,<br>in hopes of letting the drums shine through.</p>
  <p>Rather than a repetitive pattern of melodies,<br>each part of the song is new.</p>
  <p>This allows the song to flow and evolve,<br>rather than repeat.</p>
  <p>While this song still carries at a reasonable speed,<br>it actually runs at 280 beats per minute.</p>
  <p>Allowing me to interject two samples in the beat sequencer,<br>where there usually is just room for one.</p>

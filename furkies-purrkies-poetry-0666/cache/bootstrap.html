    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And this Christmas,<br>I bought them <strong>four</strong> bags of peanuts and composed a song.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Her first hiding spot...<br>was just on top a hand rain.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It wasn't so much of a hiding spot - even though she tried for all her might,<br>it was more like a peanut display - good for her.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is a song,<br>that uses drums from all around the world.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It tries to avoid high pitched sounds,<br>in hopes of letting the drums shine through.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Rather than a repetitive pattern of melodies,<br>each part of the song is new.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This allows the song to flow and evolve,<br>rather than repeat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">While this song still carries at a reasonable speed,<br>it actually runs at 280 beats per minute.</div>

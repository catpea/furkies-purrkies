  <p>Everyone of us has the responsibility to stand for truth,<br>to stand authentic, and un-freaking-brekable.</p>

  <p>If we allow ourselves to get broken,<br>then three will be no future.</p>
  <p>Don't expect those doing the breaking,<br>to create any future, they can only feed on destruction.</p>

  <p>While we are not animals in the terrible sense of the word,<br>we are still Great Warriors, it is our heritage.</p>
  <p>I repeat not a single student, or dreamer, or geek, or beautiful loser, or the <strong>truly beautiful</strong> cursed to never see it that way,<br>is allowed to retreat into their room, into their depression, and darkness.</p>
  <p>Be it loss, or tragedy, or because some hollow creature,<br>did or said something cruel.</p>
  <p>The hollow,<br>or the unfortunate that bullies turn to bullies... for hate can only spread.</p>
  <p>Can't really remember you,<br>and even if they could, they live in a crumpled piece of paper universe.</p>
  <p>The tragedy of a bully, aside from the harm they cause, is that - for as long as they live in their sorry state,<br>their time in life has already passed, maybe short of some flicker in their final days.</p>

  <p>In a way, those who feel pain, or dread, or fell hurt,<br>and never do the hurting - are being called to greatness.</p>
  <p>Because those who cause harm to the beautiful,<br>can't perceive futures and thus can build.</p>
  <p>Do you understand,<br>if the hurt don't rise - there is no future.</p>
  <p>The hurt,<br>are the only hope.</p>

  <p>It may come as a surprise,<br>it certainly comes as a surprise to many.</p>
  <p>That Ariadne has left a string for us all,<br>we don't even have to reach for it, you just need to touch your index finger to your thumb.</p>
  <p>And imagine you are holding a brush,<br>the string is art.</p>
  <p>And yes there is a problem,<br>yes there is a problem with the on ramp.</p>
  <p>Because in dread,<br>you can't get the colors right, in dread the shapes will slide.</p>
  <p>But this is not a problem of the soul of an artist,<br>this is a mechanical problem with the way we hold the brush on our out of darkness.</p>
  <p>You mess with computers a little bit, you install Krita,<br>you stretch the image reference over your entire canvas and make it transparent.</p>
  <p>Now no matter how hard it is to hold the brush,<br>no matter how hard it is to see through the tears.</p>
  <p>You have your colors,<br>and you have your shapes.</p>
  <p>And in three, five,<br>or whenever you are satisfied with your perfect portraits and finally convinced you were an artist all along...</p>
  <p>You will let go of the realistic colors,<br>because you will know better - nay - you will neeeeed better.</p>
  <p>You will need more sunshine than a reference photo could possibly hold,<br>and the temperature of your work will have to match the temperature of the color in your best visions.</p>
  <p>And just about at the same time,<br>you will need better shapes too.</p>
  <p>By making the eyes bigger, you make the painting speak more, by adding a touch of fish-eye perspective, you can lean your subject into the space of the person looking at it,<br>and by that time you will have memorized how to paint the eye ten times over.</p>
  <p>Eventually, your soul will pour your own special color into your works,<br>and your touch will speak with larger eyes, and that edge of sunlight, and the cheek bone highlight.</p>
  <p>Art is here for all of us, whether it calls to you or not, know that you are an artist,<br>You Are An Artist.</p>

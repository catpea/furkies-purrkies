    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">By making the eyes bigger, you make the painting speak more, by adding a touch of fish-eye perspective, you can lean your subject into the space of the person looking at it,<br>and by that time you will have memorized how to paint the eye ten times over.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Eventually, your soul will pour your own special color into your works,<br>and your touch will speak with larger eyes, and that edge of sunlight, and the cheek bone highlight.</div>

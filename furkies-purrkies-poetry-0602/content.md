School or College is an amazing time to read,
and on our own we can learn anything, in deed.

And if you can learn anything,
then you should aim to contain everything.

It is one of our perks,
and how a universe works.

---

And the more you know,
the better your decisions go.

Until your mind is fully grown,
your decisions are not quite your own.

We must all grow up as fast as we can,
that is what it means to be human.

---

People who are misinformed about the world,
are being controlled.

There as as many motives as there are crooks,
and cure is found in reading thousands of books.

---

Not all falsehoods look like lies,
they often have an elaborate, golden disguise.

So do not read just one,
but countless books that are celebrated by everyone.

The best books are often said to change lives or the the word,
and those are the only true gold.

Go to the library and look,
that is all it takes to find your first life changing book.

Plus, we live in a beautiful age,
where you can __listen__ to books without turning a page.

So, do not delay,
search for your book today.

Reading of listening to books is about moving from what you were told,
out into the real world.

---

The real world is not a scary place,
so as long as you hold wisdom in firm embrace.

The best way to find real friends,
is to look at life though your own lens.

To learn and learn to no end,
until you become worthy of being and having a real friend.

In reading books you will find that those who run to bars,
eventually regret it in their memoirs.

The meaning of life is found in rising up,
in being serious about growing up.

Sometimes people don't need a liar to become mislead,
and become crushed by sadness instead.

It is because they don't know that one of the library's treasures,
is to grant us the sacred ability to resist all crushing pressures.

It is the most heartbreaking thing in the world
the oldest story hardly told.

Instead of finding a cheerful book,
they turn towards another heartless crook.

---

So much ache and regret is had,
without knowing that a silly book can cure being sad.

Books can cure us from all manner of woe,
and continue encouraging us to fully grow.

Merely belonging to some circle or group,
often just leads a person in a loop.

But books help us rise from misery and strife,
and being cheerful is very important in life.

For one we begin to glow in a way,
it is probably the class with which we move though the day.

And we stop turning our trouble off to relax,
and begin laying down our own tracks.

---

It is almost funny that the old library,
is how life stops being scary.

So as long as you take to books, and wisdom, you don't need to follow what we are told,
you will be safe out in the real world.

When the decisions we make are fueled by wisdom and are truly our own,
we will learn to live wisely and with wisdom become fully grown.

---

It would be amazing, if following other people took us to the library,
but in the modern culture it takes us to the bar - where life will absolutely get scary.

We have to learn to set our foot down,
and say "I am not going through life with a freaking frown.".

---

Hey, maybe you can be the one,
that will show her friends that the library is fun.

Could you become your school's first inspiration,
that leads everyone to the wisdom in some magnificent oration?

---

Bring your friends to the library and quietly whisper to them the amazing parts,
show them the wisdom and all the beautiful hearts.

Tell them that the move away from books,
will almost always take them towards creepers and crooks.

Tell them that we find each other in life by means of light,
and that we are seen the best when we glow bright.

Tell them that it is in the wisdom we find and not in doing what we are told.
and that we have to search through many books to find the real gold.

---

The universe within us requires stars to create the constellations we need,
and you can only ignite a star, when you read.

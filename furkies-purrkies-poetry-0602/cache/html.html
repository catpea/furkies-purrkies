  <p>School or College is an amazing time to read,<br>and on our own we can learn anything, in deed.</p>
  <p>And if you can learn anything,<br>then you should aim to contain everything.</p>
  <p>It is one of our perks,<br>and how a universe works.</p>

  <p>And the more you know,<br>the better your decisions go.</p>
  <p>Until your mind is fully grown,<br>your decisions are not quite your own.</p>
  <p>We must all grow up as fast as we can,<br>that is what it means to be human.</p>

  <p>People who are misinformed about the world,<br>are being controlled.</p>
  <p>There as as many motives as there are crooks,<br>and cure is found in reading thousands of books.</p>

  <p>Not all falsehoods look like lies,<br>they often have an elaborate, golden disguise.</p>
  <p>So do not read just one,<br>but countless books that are celebrated by everyone.</p>
  <p>The best books are often said to change lives or the the word,<br>and those are the only true gold.</p>
  <p>Go to the library and look,<br>that is all it takes to find your first life changing book.</p>
  <p>Plus, we live in a beautiful age,<br>where you can <strong>listen</strong> to books without turning a page.</p>
  <p>So, do not delay,<br>search for your book today.</p>
  <p>Reading of listening to books is about moving from what you were told,<br>out into the real world.</p>

  <p>The real world is not a scary place,<br>so as long as you hold wisdom in firm embrace.</p>
  <p>The best way to find real friends,<br>is to look at life though your own lens.</p>
  <p>To learn and learn to no end,<br>until you become worthy of being and having a real friend.</p>
  <p>In reading books you will find that those who run to bars,<br>eventually regret it in their memoirs.</p>
  <p>The meaning of life is found in rising up,<br>in being serious about growing up.</p>
  <p>Sometimes people don't need a liar to become mislead,<br>and become crushed by sadness instead.</p>
  <p>It is because they don't know that one of the library's treasures,<br>is to grant us the sacred ability to resist all crushing pressures.</p>
  <p>It is the most heartbreaking thing in the world<br>the oldest story hardly told.</p>
  <p>Instead of finding a cheerful book,<br>they turn towards another heartless crook.</p>

  <p>So much ache and regret is had,<br>without knowing that a silly book can cure being sad.</p>
  <p>Books can cure us from all manner of woe,<br>and continue encouraging us to fully grow.</p>
  <p>Merely belonging to some circle or group,<br>often just leads a person in a loop.</p>
  <p>But books help us rise from misery and strife,<br>and being cheerful is very important in life.</p>
  <p>For one we begin to glow in a way,<br>it is probably the class with which we move though the day.</p>
  <p>And we stop turning our trouble off to relax,<br>and begin laying down our own tracks.</p>

  <p>It is almost funny that the old library,<br>is how life stops being scary.</p>
  <p>So as long as you take to books, and wisdom, you don't need to follow what we are told,<br>you will be safe out in the real world.</p>
  <p>When the decisions we make are fueled by wisdom and are truly our own,<br>we will learn to live wisely and with wisdom become fully grown.</p>

  <p>It would be amazing, if following other people took us to the library,<br>but in the modern culture it takes us to the bar - where life will absolutely get scary.</p>
  <p>We have to learn to set our foot down,<br>and say "I am not going through life with a freaking frown.".</p>

  <p>Hey, maybe you can be the one,<br>that will show her friends that the library is fun.</p>
  <p>Could you become your school's first inspiration,<br>that leads everyone to the wisdom in some magnificent oration?</p>

  <p>Bring your friends to the library and quietly whisper to them the amazing parts,<br>show them the wisdom and all the beautiful hearts.</p>
  <p>Tell them that the move away from books,<br>will almost always take them towards creepers and crooks.</p>
  <p>Tell them that we find each other in life by means of light,<br>and that we are seen the best when we glow bright.</p>
  <p>Tell them that it is in the wisdom we find and not in doing what we are told.<br>and that we have to search through many books to find the real gold.</p>

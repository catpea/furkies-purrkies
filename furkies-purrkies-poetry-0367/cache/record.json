some.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Mentally alert means, you take care of your mind,</p>\n  <p>that you are rested, that you are free.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Do not let mediocrity, liars, cheaters, pretenders hurt your mind,</p>\n  <p>you have to be mentally alert, mentally well enough to easily go above and beyond.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Please allow me to make a note here, I&apos;ll make it brief,</p>\n  <p>people are stressed out by fake education, more and more drugs are becoming accessible.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Furthermore, there maybe schools that in their evil will attempt to diagnose people with states of mind that woudn&apos;t exist,</p>\n  <p>if it wasn&apos;t for the insanity of school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Sir Ken Robinson, called unusually high number of prescriptions for ADHD a sign of a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s&amp;t=2195\">A Fictitious Epidemic</a>&quot;,</p>\n  <p>and fake schools will cause depression in a healthy mind, that is how it works,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If schools start medicating the kids they depressed,</p>\n  <p>then even if you want school, get out, get out as fast as you can.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And remember liars are never obvious,</p>\n  <p>liars always live in the twilight, there will be no proof, no evidence, just better grades and better profits.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Be careful,</p>\n  <p>it is that kind of a world, I am sorry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Mental Well Being, is Number One,</p>\n  <p>number two, is somewhat related, especially if you are in middle school or high school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The first thing you need is an upgrade on you view of the world,</p>\n  <p>the way you inherit a more sophisticated intellectual culture is Audio Books.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They are not free,</p>\n  <p>they should be free for people under 21.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is no one book, it will take over a hundred Audio Books,</p>\n  <p>- and you know this, this one is not easy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>With a hundred books, you will create a self-balancing view of the world,</p>\n  <p>and in the process inherit character traits from many of your favorite authors.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Intellectual Inheritance,</p>\n  <p>is just another way of saying growing up by reading books.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is one of the reasons why you need a safe place, a safe space,</p>\n  <p>so that you may grow up, uninterrupted by things that are not worthy of you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is one sure way to accelerate your intellectual growth,</p>\n  <p>but you need three more friends, at least, and you need to be in your 20s or up.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>An that is taking to the trails,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t do this alone, please.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In United States we have The Appalachian Trail,</p>\n  <p>and The Pacific Crest Trail.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bring your Audiobooks, Bear Spray, and an Air Horn (bears don&apos;t like loud sounds),</p>\n  <p>especially if it is four horns going off at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Ignore people that say you don&apos;t need the horn,</p>\n  <p>just activate it until they walk away.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bring your journal,</p>\n  <p>and grow.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The biggest problems you face when you are young,</p>\n  <p>is a smaller grasp of self awareness.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is a function of our brain still growing,</p>\n  <p>and the genetic predispositions to follow orders, to follow what your teachers tell you for example.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are also building a view of the world,</p>\n  <p>and stuff that isn&apos;t real is polluting it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So, schools are forcing you into memorization, and each semester you have little to show for it,</p>\n  <p>especially if you ask yourself: &quot;What if I just spent five months learning how to use a Digital Audio Workstation?&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You would be able to compose music, probably in just a week,</p>\n  <p>by the fifth month you would be publishing your second album on bandcamp, and with some advertising, you could make probably more than a $100 a month.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even so, you tell yourself, schools are important,</p>\n  <p>I need schools, because schools get me to college, and perhaps med school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You probably don&apos;t go as far as pondering the $241,600 average unforgivable student loan debt,</p>\n  <p>because you can just pay it off after you get the job.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is why you need a hundred of those Audio Books,</p>\n  <p>if you want to be a doctor, then in your first hundred books ten will be about becoming one, and a couple about the regrets.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But it is more than just shining light on your career,</p>\n  <p>it is about shining light on the way you make choices.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can&apos;t jump forward,</p>\n  <p>you have to move precisely deliberately.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have to start in High School to be a Doctor,</p>\n  <p>you have to love it, it has to call to you, you may do part time at a veterinary clinic, and maybe work at a retirement home.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just waiting for Med School to make you a Doctor is not enough,</p>\n  <p>you have to love making your way there, it has to inspire you, fuel you, it has to make you happy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Self awareness means that you know where you are,</p>\n  <p>and you know a clear and stable path towards the future.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In terms of becoming a Doctor, everything that is covered in the first two years of med school,</p>\n  <p>you have to cover on your own in the first two years of high school, just as a function of curiosity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Something in you has to ask, what is MCAT and MLE about... anyways?</p>\n  <p>and then you go shopping for a microscope, and might as well pick up a stethoscope and take interest in the heath of your gerbil, or cat.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In other words, in terms of becoming a Doctor, memorization is required,</p>\n  <p>even though it is not effective, and pretty stupid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And if you take to using what you memorized without double checking,</p>\n  <p>then you will get in trouble.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just as a side-note, the right way of doing this,</p>\n  <p>is not to memorize, but to love so many things about the field that you immediately absorb new information.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Sometimes with tears in your eyes as you deep down know you made a huge breakthrough,</p>\n  <p>which means you don&apos;t need to memorize it, and will never forget it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And sometimes with passionate anger, at all the idiots that made it too confusing,</p>\n  <p>because they clearly didn&apos;t know what they were taking about.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In terms of a more open future,</p>\n  <p>where we just say to ourselves I&apos;ll just get a good job after I graduate college.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is a different story, because now you are looking at $32,000 to $50,000 in debt,</p>\n  <p>and memorizing things that you will forget when you start your job.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You know when Police stops you, and ask you &quot;Do you know what you did wrong?&quot;,</p>\n  <p>to get you to admit to whatever it is, to make their job easier, and a fool out of you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Jobs do the same thing they will say Entry Position, Experience Required,</p>\n  <p>so that during the interview, they can say &quot;we can&apos;t pay you that much, because you do not have the experience we asked for&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In this situation, Self Awareness translates to asking:</p>\n  <p>&quot;do I want to work for such a company?&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Do you want to work for a company,</p>\n  <p>that is already trying to take advantage of you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>After four years of high school and four years of college,</p>\n  <p>and with $32,000 to $50,000 of unforgivable debt, plus your credit cards, and other tricks.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are now being insulted,</p>\n  <p>on your happy interview day.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You need to consider this,</p>\n  <p>and you need to consider what it is like to work in a cubicle for the rest of your life.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not only are you looking at eight years of school,</p>\n  <p>but about 80 years of working in a box, or worse an open space where you can hear all the moth breathers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Self awareness means intercepting mistakes before they happen,</p>\n  <p>again only renowned Audio Books by good narrators, written by highly respected and loved authors will help you with this.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At least a hundred books,</p>\n  <p>there is a video of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd_ptbiPoXM\" title=\"Steve Jobs&apos; 2005 Stanford Commencement Address (with intro by President John Hennessy)\">Stanford Commencement Address that Steve Jobs gave in 2005</a>, that you may wish to see.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Despite what Mr. Jobs says about the dots,</p>\n  <p>you can connect them, it is the job of you increasing your self awareness with books to connect them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You do not go forward into the future merely trusting your gut, or destiny, life, karma, whatever,</p>\n  <p>because the world is full of people that will take advantage of that blind expectation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So you absolutely need to take care of your mental well being,</p>\n  <p>and expansion of your self awareness by listening to dozens and dozens of audio books highly valued by their readers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even by just watching how Steve Jobs carries him self,</p>\n  <p>how he talks about college tuition, he is gently and in very classy way pealing apart that fraud.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is the first and foremost thing he brings up,</p>\n  <p>because he refuses to be a part of it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To name a few of my most influential figures:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVyeh690TGk\">Richard Dawkins - The God Delusion Q&amp;A at Liberty University</a>&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Liberty University (LU) is a private evangelical Christian university in Lynchburg, Virginia,</p>\n  <p>that Q&amp;A was destined for greatness.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A young lady poses a question &quot;What if you&apos;re wrong?&quot;,</p>\n  <p>and this is my private opinion: I think she was aiming at Pascal&apos;s Wager, but Richard Dawkins response was a lot more elaborate than shooting fish in a barrel.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Search the internet for a video entitled &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F_LUFIeUk0\">PHILOSOPHY - Religion: Pascal&apos;s Wager</a>&quot; for more information on Pascal&apos;s Wager,</p>\n  <p>which also includes a bespectacled cartoon kitty named Richard Pawkins.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And between you and I the gambit it shutdown with an argument for authenticity,</p>\n  <p>if someone believes something purely for personal gain then they can&apos;t be invited to a serious discussion.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But the Pascal&apos;s Wager interpretation of what this humble young lady is asking about, is just my personal opinion,</p>\n  <p>and Richard Dawkins takes it his own way.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Which resulted in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPJQw-x-xho\">wonderfully animated Richard Dawkins in a South Park cartoon</a>,</p>\n  <p>I love that little smile of accomplishment at the end, but more than that, I love the audience.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The sound of the Audience at Liberty University,</p>\n  <p>tells me that we are still headed for the Stars.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But again the reason I bring this up in no uncertain terms is:</p>\n  <p>Inheritance of Class, and Culture, and expansion of our awareness of the world, and how we fit in it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just observing the way that Richard Dawkins carries him self,</p>\n  <p>and hearing the cheer and laughter by all the wonderful people in the audience, helped me expand my personal vision of the world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here is another side of Richard Dawkins, and even more giggles,</p>\n  <p>a two part Extravaganza.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Part one &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYT4vE1gvM\">Hate E-mails with Richard Dawkins</a>&quot;,</p>\n  <p>and the second batch &quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gW7607YiBso\">Love Letters to Richard Dawkins</a>&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Search internet videos for Richard Dawkins in 1991 presenting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHoxZF3ZgTo&amp;list=PLKSmsr0k7vdmpD-ABiNeiXiy9_XwXf5bC\">Growing Up in the Universe</a>, a series of five lectures,</p>\n  <p>held at the Royal Institution in London.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Institution_Christmas_Lectures\">Royal Institution Christmas Lectures</a> are a great tradition and a great honor,</p>\n  <p>here scientists present science in a way that opens doors for those who are new to science.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>He also created an hour and a half long documentary,</p>\n  <p>entitled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzZh2wstj88\" title=\"Richard Dawkins&apos; The God Delusion, Full Documentary\">The God Delusion</a>, you can really see what it means to be a great being, and hope to help the word progress forward.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Richard Dawkins is one of many people</p>\n  <p>who will help you with your awareness..</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you are stuck, cramming for tests, you can ask what would Richard do,</p>\n  <p>would he sit here pretending to get educated, would he try to change schools, talk to the principal, or give a set of banned lectures on how the school only cares that everyone gets paid.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And if you are into science,</p>\n  <p>I hope you have a day dream about presenting you science of choice at the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures someday.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Number one, is Mental Well Being,</p>\n  <p>number two, is view of the world, the view of yourself in relation to our world, and class, and foresight.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And number three, is business,</p>\n  <p>we all have different interests.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is tough to give general business advice,</p>\n  <p>but; setting up a laboratory where you tutor med students helping them see through a microscope or visualization what they are attempting to blindly memorize.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are inclined towards science, then programming languages can be used as a kind of a microscope,</p>\n  <p>you can examine any complex system or theory by writing a tiny simulation, or implementation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are not sure where you are headed, then begin writing a Science Journal, let other scientist publish or peer review,</p>\n  <p>and you can stay in the field without having to work 26 hour shifts for $300, remember number 1, your well being is most important.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Away from the laboratories, in my private opinion is where the party is,</p>\n  <p>unconstrained by any field in particular you can do, everything.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For one, 3D printing is awesome, and you can find it as a service online too,</p>\n  <p>you can sculpt in clay 3D scan it and then miniaturize them and open up a little jewelry store on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTZBjj010XA\">Shapeways</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can open up a First Person View <a

class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/b/Lumber-Composites-Plywood-Sheathing-Plywood/N-5yc1vZc7q5\">With an Office Projector and some Plywood Sheathing you can begin painting 8ft

portrait every time.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Remember, to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuslLjXba9I\">desaturate a color you mix it with the opposite on the color wheel</a>,</p>\n  <p>there is an exception for the primaries, you mix the full triad, secondary colors already consist of two colors, so you just add the opposite, and that makes the triad.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As with Science, you must be lead by you passion,</p>\n  <p>everything you do has to be

great library within you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>While I can&apos;t show you the direction you must move towards to create your business,</p>\n  <p>there is a guiding idea that

school.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The first thing you need is an upgrade on you view of the world,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the way you inherit a more sophisticated intellectual culture is Audio Books.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">With a hundred books, you will create a self-balancing view of the world,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and in the process inherit character traits from many of your favorite authors.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Intellectual Inheritance,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is just another way of saying growing up by reading books.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is one of the reasons why you need a safe place, a safe space,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so that you may grow up, uninterrupted by things that are not worthy of you.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There is one sure way to accelerate your intellectual growth,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but you need three more friends, at least, and you need to be in your 20s or up.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">An that is taking to the trails,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">don't do this alone, please.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In United States we have The Appalachian Trail,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and The Pacific Crest Trail.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Bring your Audiobooks, Bear Spray, and an Air Horn (bears don't like loud sounds),</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">especially if it is four horns going off at the same time.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Ignore people that say you don't need the horn,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">just activate it until they walk away.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Bring your journal,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and grow.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The biggest problems you face when you are young,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is a smaller grasp of self awareness.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is a function of our brain still growing,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the genetic predispositions to follow orders, to follow what your teachers tell you for example.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You are also building a view of the world,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and stuff that isn't real is polluting it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So, schools are forcing you into memorization, and each semester you have little to show for it,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">especially if you ask yourself: \"What if I just spent five months learning how to use a Digital Audio Workstation?\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You would be able to compose music, probably in just a week,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">by the fifth month you would be publishing your second album on bandcamp, and with some advertising, you could make probably more than a $100 a month.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Even so, you tell yourself, schools are important,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I need schools, because schools get me to college, and perhaps med school.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You probably don't go as far as pondering the $241,600 average unforgivable student loan debt,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because you can just pay it off after you get the job.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is why you need a hundred of those Audio Books,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">if you want to be a doctor, then in your first hundred books ten will be about becoming one, and a couple about the regrets.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But it is more than just shining light on your career,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it is about shining light on the way you make choices.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You can't jump forward,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you have to move precisely deliberately.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You have to start in High School to be a Doctor,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you have to love it, it has to call to you, you may do part time at a veterinary clinic, and maybe work at a retirement home.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Just waiting for Med School to make you a Doctor is not enough,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you have to love making your way there, it has to inspire you, fuel you, it has to make you happy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Self awareness means that you know where you are,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and you know a clear and stable path towards the future.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In terms of becoming a Doctor, everything that is covered in the first two years of med school,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you have to cover on your own in the first two years of high school, just as a function of curiosity.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Something in you has to ask, what is MCAT and MLE about... anyways?</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and then you go shopping for a microscope, and might as well pick up a stethoscope and take interest in the heath of your gerbil, or cat.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In other words, in terms of becoming a Doctor, memorization is required,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">even though it is not effective, and pretty stupid.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And if you take to using what you memorized without double checking,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">then you will get in trouble.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Just as a side-note, the right way of doing this,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is not to memorize, but to love so many things about the field that you immediately absorb new information.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes with tears in your eyes as you deep down know you made a huge breakthrough,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">which means you don't need to memorize it, and will never forget it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And sometimes with passionate anger, at all the idiots that made it too confusing,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because they clearly didn't know what they were taking about.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In terms of a more open future,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">where we just say to ourselves I'll just get a good job after I graduate college.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is a different story, because now you are looking at $32,000 to $50,000 in debt,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and memorizing things that you will forget when you start your job.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You know when Police stops you, and ask you \"Do you know what you did wrong?\",</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">to get you to admit to whatever it is, to make their job easier, and a fool out of you.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Jobs do the same thing they will say Entry Position, Experience Required,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so that during the interview, they can say \"we can't pay you that much, because you do not have the experience we asked for\".</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In this situation, Self Awareness translates to asking:</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">\"do I want to work for such a company?\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Do you want to work for a company,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that is already trying to take advantage of you.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">After four years of high school and four years of college,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and with $32,000 to $50,000 of unforgivable debt, plus your credit cards, and other tricks.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You are now being insulted,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">on your happy interview day.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You need to consider this,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and you need to consider what it is like to work in a cubicle for the rest of your life.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Not only are you looking at eight years of school,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but about 80 years of working in a box, or worse an open space where you can hear all the moth breathers.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Self awareness means intercepting mistakes before they happen,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">again only renowned Audio Books by good narrators, written by highly respected and loved authors will help you with this.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">At least a hundred books,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there is a video of <span>Stanford Commencement Address that Steve Jobs gave in 2005<sup>[2]</sup></span>, that you may wish to see.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Despite what Mr. Jobs says about the dots,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you can connect them, it is the job of you increasing your self awareness with books to connect them.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You do not go forward into the future merely trusting your gut, or destiny, life, karma, whatever,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because the world is full of people that will take advantage of that blind expectation.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So you absolutely need to take care of your mental well being,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and expansion of your self awareness by listening to dozens and dozens of audio books highly valued by their readers.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Even by just watching how Steve Jobs carries him self,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">how he talks about college tuition, he is gently and in very classy way pealing apart that fraud.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is the first and foremost thing he brings up,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because he refuses to be a part of it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To name a few of my most influential figures:</div>\n</div>\n<div

that I really like,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there is a video titled \"<span>Richard Dawkins - The God Delusion Q&A at Liberty University<sup>[22]</sup></span>\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Liberty University (LU) is a private evangelical Christian university in Lynchburg, Virginia,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that Q&A was destined for greatness.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A young lady poses a question \"What if you're wrong?\",</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and this is my private opinion: I think she was aiming at Pascal's Wager, but Richard Dawkins response was a lot more elaborate than shooting fish in a barrel.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Search the internet for a video entitled \"<span>PHILOSOPHY - Religion: Pascal's Wager<sup>[23]</sup></span>\" for more information on Pascal's Wager,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">which also includes a bespectacled cartoon kitty named Richard Pawkins.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And between you and I the gambit it shutdown with an argument for authenticity,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">if someone believes something purely for personal gain then they can't be invited to a serious discussion.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But the Pascal's Wager interpretation of what this humble young lady is asking about, is just my personal opinion,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and Richard Dawkins takes it his own way.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Which resulted in a <span>wonderfully animated Richard Dawkins in a South Park cartoon<sup>[24]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I love that little smile of accomplishment at the end, but more than that, I love the audience.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The sound of the Audience at Liberty University,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">tells me that we are still headed for the Stars.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But again the reason I bring this up in no uncertain terms is:</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Inheritance of Class, and Culture, and expansion of our awareness of the world, and how we fit in it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Just observing the way that Richard Dawkins carries him self,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and hearing the cheer and laughter by all the wonderful people in the audience, helped me expand my personal vision of the world.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Part one \"<span>Hate E-mails with Richard Dawkins<sup>[25]</sup></span>\",</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the second batch \"<span>Love Letters to Richard Dawkins<sup>[26]</sup></span>\".</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Search internet

  "text": "Above all, begin paying attention to your mental well being,\nwhatever is causing you harm, get away from it.\nIf you think you can't get away from it,\nthen find a relative that will take you in.\nIf you don't have relatives,\nthen you will have to talk to your best friend's parents.\nYou can't stay in a place that is stressing you out,\nyou need a place that is safe, a place where you can think.\n\nAnd then begin thinking about building a company,\nor a tiny business, at first just for learning.\n\nEveryone says it is not easy,\npeople say they get burned out, overworked.\nBut that is the wrong approach,\nyou need to be whole.\n\nThere is a little passage in the Ranger Creed,\nthat nobly emphasizes just that.\n\n\"Never shall I fail my comrades. I will always keep myself mentally alert, physically strong and morally straight and I will shoulder more than my share of the task whatever it may be, one-hundred-percent and then some.\n\nMentally alert means, you take care of your mind,\nthat you are rested, that you are free.\n\nDo not let mediocrity, liars, cheaters, pretenders hurt your mind,\nyou have to be mentally alert, mentally well enough to easily go above and beyond.\n\nPlease allow me to make a note here, I'll make it brief,\npeople are stressed out by fake education, more and more drugs are becoming accessible.\nFurthermore, there maybe schools that in their evil will attempt to diagnose people with states of mind that woudn't exist,\nif it wasn't for the insanity of school.\nSir Ken Robinson, called unusually high number of prescriptions for ADHD a sign of a \"A Fictitious Epidemic[1]\",\nand fake schools will cause depression in a healthy mind, that is how it works,\nIf schools start medicating the kids they depressed,\nthen even if you want school, get out, get out as fast as you can.\nAnd remember liars are never obvious,\nliars always live in the twilight, there will be no proof, no evidence, just better grades and better profits.\nBe careful,\nit is that kind of a world, I am sorry.\n\nMental Well Being, is Number One,\nnumber two, is somewhat related, especially if you are in middle school or high school.\nThe first thing you need is an upgrade on you view of the world,\nthe way you inherit a more sophisticated intellectual culture is Audio Books.\nThey are not free,\nthey should be free for people under 21.\nThere is no one book, it will take over a hundred Audio Books,\n- and you know this, this one is not easy.\nWith a hundred books, you will create a self-balancing view of the world,\nand in the process inherit character traits from many of your favorite authors.\nIntellectual Inheritance,\nis just another way of saying growing up by reading books.\nThis is one of the reasons why you need a safe place, a safe space,\nso that you may grow up, uninterrupted by things that are not worthy of you.\n\nThere is one sure way to accelerate your intellectual growth,\nbut you need three more friends, at least, and you need to be in your 20s or up.\nAn that is taking to the trails,\ndon't do this alone, please.\nIn United States we have The Appalachian Trail,\nand The Pacific Crest Trail.\nBring your Audiobooks, Bear Spray, and an Air Horn (bears don't like loud sounds),\nespecially if it is four horns going off at the same time.\nIgnore people that say you don't need the horn,\njust activate it until they walk away.\nBring your journal,\nand grow.\n\nThe biggest problems you face when you are young,\nis a smaller grasp of self awareness.\nThis is a function of our brain still growing,\nand the genetic predispositions to follow orders, to follow what your teachers tell you for example.\nYou are also building a view of the world,\nand stuff that isn't real is polluting it.\nSo, schools are forcing you into memorization, and each semester you have little to show for it,\nespecially if you ask yourself: \"What if I just spent five months learning how to use a Digital Audio Workstation?\"\nYou would be able to compose music, probably in just a week,\nby the fifth month you would be publishing your second album on bandcamp, and with some advertising, you could make probably more than a $100 a month.\nEven so, you tell yourself, schools are important,\nI need schools, because schools get me to college, and perhaps med school.\nYou probably don't go as far as pondering the $241,600 average unforgivable student loan debt,\nbecause you can just pay it off after you get the job.\nThis is why you need a hundred of those Audio Books,\nif you want to be a doctor, then in your first hundred books ten will be about becoming one, and a couple about the regrets.\nBut it is more than just shining light on your career,\nit is about shining light on the way you make choices.\nYou can't jump forward,\nyou have to move precisely deliberately.\nYou have to start in High School to be a Doctor,\nyou have to love it, it has to call to you, you may do part time at a veterinary clinic, and maybe work at a retirement home.\nJust waiting for Med School to make you a Doctor is not enough,\nyou have to love making your way there, it has to inspire you, fuel you, it has to make you happy.\nSelf awareness means that you know where you are,\nand you know a clear and stable path towards the future.\n\nIn terms of becoming a Doctor, everything that is covered in the first two years of med school,\nyou have to cover on your own in the first two years of high school, just as a function of curiosity.\nSomething in you has to ask, what is MCAT and MLE about... anyways?\nand then you go shopping for a microscope, and might as well pick up a stethoscope and take interest in the heath of your gerbil, or cat.\nIn other words, in terms of becoming a Doctor, memorization is required,\neven though it is not effective, and pretty stupid.\nAnd if you take to using what you memorized without double checking,\nthen you will get in trouble.\nJust as a side-note, the right way of doing this,\nis not to memorize, but to love so many things about the field that you immediately absorb new information.\nSometimes with tears in your eyes as you deep down know you made a huge breakthrough,\nwhich means you don't need to memorize it, and will never forget it.\nAnd sometimes with passionate anger, at all the idiots that made it too confusing,\nbecause they clearly didn't know what they were taking about.\n\nIn terms of a more open future,\nwhere we just say to ourselves I'll just get a good job after I graduate college.\nIt is a different story, because now you are looking at $32,000 to $50,000 in debt,\nand memorizing things that you will forget when you start your job.\nYou know when Police stops you, and ask you \"Do you know what you did wrong?\",\nto get you to admit to whatever it is, to make their job easier, and a fool out of you.\nJobs do the same thing they will say Entry Position, Experience Required,\nso that during the interview, they can say \"we can't pay you that much, because you do not have the experience we asked for\".\nIn this situation, Self Awareness translates to asking:\n\"do I want to work for such a company?\"\nDo you want to work for a company,\nthat is already trying to take advantage of you.\nAfter four years of high school and four years of college,\nand with $32,000 to $50,000 of unforgivable debt, plus your credit cards, and other tricks.\nYou are now being insulted,\non your happy interview day.\nYou need to consider this,\nand you need to consider what it is like to work in a cubicle for the rest of your life.\nNot only are you looking at eight years of school,\nbut about 80 years of working in a box, or worse an open space where you can hear all the moth breathers.\n\nSelf awareness means intercepting mistakes before they happen,\nagain only renowned Audio Books by good narrators, written by highly respected and loved authors will help you with this.\nAt least a hundred books,\nthere is a video of Stanford Commencement Address that Steve Jobs gave in 2005[2], that you may wish to see.\nDespite what Mr. Jobs says about the dots,\nyou can connect them, it is the job of you increasing your self awareness with books to connect them.\nYou do not go forward into the future merely trusting your gut, or destiny, life, karma, whatever,\nbecause the world is full of people that will take advantage of that blind expectation.\nSo you absolutely need to take care of your mental well being,\nand expansion of your self awareness by listening to dozens and dozens of audio books highly valued by their readers.\nEven by just watching how Steve Jobs carries him self,\nhow he talks about college tuition, he is gently and in very classy way pealing apart that fraud.\nIt is the first and foremost thing he brings up,\nbecause he refuses to be a part of it.\n\nTo name a few of my most influential figures:\n * Sir Ken Robinson[3]\n * Astra Taylor[4]\n * Bill Bryson[5]\n * Richard Dawkins[6]\n * Sam Harris[7]\n * PZ Myers[8]\n * Lawrence Krauss[9]\n * Lord Martin Rees[10]\n * Jill Tarter[11]\n * Seth Shostak[12]\n * Alex Filippenko[13]\n * Sean Carroll[14]\n * Jared Diamond[15]\n * Howard Zinn[16]\n * Brené Brown[17]\n * Ayaan Hirsi Ali[18]\n * Daniel Dennett[19]\n * Christopher Hitchens[20]\n * Noam Chomsky[21]\n\nThere is this one talk by Richard Dawkins that I really like,\nthere is a video titled \"Richard Dawkins - The God Delusion Q&A at Liberty University[22]\"\nLiberty University (LU) is a private evangelical Christian university in Lynchburg, Virginia,\nthat Q&A was destined for greatness.\nA young lady poses a question \"What if you're wrong?\",\nand this is my private opinion: I think she was aiming at Pascal's Wager, but Richard Dawkins response was a lot more elaborate than shooting fish in a barrel.\nSearch the internet for a video entitled \"PHILOSOPHY - Religion: Pascal's Wager[23]\" for more information on Pascal's Wager,\nwhich also includes a bespectacled cartoon kitty named Richard Pawkins.\nAnd between you and I the gambit it shutdown with an argument for authenticity,\nif someone believes something purely for personal gain then they can't be invited to a serious discussion.\nBut the Pascal's Wager interpretation of what this humble young lady is asking about, is just my personal opinion,\nand Richard Dawkins takes it his own way.\nWhich resulted in a wonderfully animated Richard Dawkins in a South Park cartoon[24],\nI love that little smile of accomplishment at the end, but more than that, I love the audience.\nThe sound of the Audience at Liberty University,\ntells me that we are still headed for the Stars.\n\nBut again the reason I bring this up in no uncertain terms is:\nInheritance of Class, and Culture, and expansion of our awareness of the world, and how we fit in it.\nJust observing the way that Richard Dawkins carries him self,\nand hearing the cheer and laughter by all the wonderful people in the audience, helped me expand my personal vision of the world.\nHere is another side of Richard Dawkins, and even more giggles,\na two part Extravaganza.\nPart one \"Hate E-mails with Richard Dawkins[25]\",\nand the second batch \"Love Letters to Richard Dawkins[26]\".\nSearch internet videos for Richard Dawkins in 1991 presenting Growing Up in the Universe[27], a series of five lectures,\nheld at the Royal Institution in London.\nRoyal Institution Christmas Lectures[28] are a great tradition and a great honor,\nhere scientists present science in a way that opens doors for those who are new to science.\nHe also created an hour and a half long documentary,\nentitled The God Delusion[29], you can really see what it means to be a great being, and hope to help the word progress forward.\n\nRichard Dawkins is one of many people\nwho will help you with your awareness..\nWhen you are stuck, cramming for tests, you can ask what would Richard do,\nwould he sit here pretending to get educated, would he try to change schools, talk to the principal, or give a set of banned lectures on how the school only cares that everyone gets paid.\nAnd if you are into science,\nI hope you have a day dream about presenting you science of choice at the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures someday.\n\nNumber one, is Mental Well Being,\nnumber two, is view of the world, the view of yourself in relation to our world, and class, and foresight.\nAnd number three, is business,\nwe all have different interests.\nIt is tough to give general business advice,\nbut; setting up a laboratory where you tutor med students helping them see through a microscope or visualization what they are attempting to blindly memorize.\nIf you are inclined towards science, then programming languages can be used as a kind of a microscope,\nyou can examine any complex system or theory by writing a tiny simulation, or implementation.\nIf you are not sure where you are headed, then begin writing a Science Journal, let other scientist publish or peer review,\nand you can stay in the field without having to work 26 hour shifts for $300, remember number 1, your well being is most important.\nAway from the laboratories, in my private opinion is where the party is,\nunconstrained by any field in particular you can do, everything.\nFor one, 3D printing is awesome, and you can find it as a service online too,\nyou can sculpt in clay 3D scan it and then miniaturize them and open up a little jewelry store on Shapeways[30].\nYou can open up a First Person View Drone Racing circuit[31],\nand perhaps have a yearly competition for automatically operated drones only.\nWith an Office Projector and some Plywood Sheathing you can begin painting 8ft murals[32],\nfollow the Old Masters[33], create the gray version of your painting first, and then add color glaze to achieve perfect portrait every time.\nRemember, to desaturate a color you mix it with the opposite on the color wheel[34],\nthere is an exception for the primaries, you mix the full triad, secondary colors already consist of two colors, so you just add the opposite, and that makes the triad.\n\nAs with Science, you must be lead by you passion,\neverything you do has to be inspired.\nWhen you are inspired, you are driven by enough information,\nto have no need for memorization, you simply integrate the new to the great library within you.\nWhile I can't show you the direction you must move towards to create your business,\nthere is a guiding idea that will help you along.\nA self published, full color book,\nthat serves as your portfolio.\nIt will contain your design sketches,\nand photographs of your complete work.\nThis will help you get clients,\nor get hired by a large company.\nI think Eiko Ishioka[35] the costume designer behind Bram Stoker's Dracula, is a perfect example of an Artist and an Entrepreneur,\nshe published her costume designs in a beautiful book[36] and got hired to work on Dracula, and won the 1993 Oscar for it[37].\n\nIn closing,\nyour mental well being must come first, and then you have to grow, as soon as you are ready to expand your horizons, read, listen, explore.\nBegin making your way into the cultures of great beings,\nby reading their books, by admiring their works, by learning from them.\nSchools will forever be a prosthetic,\neven if they do transform into a personalized education experience.\nYou need to pursue an independent plan,\non top of everything else that is going on, because only you can guarantee your won future, it has always been in your own hands.\n\nAnd never forget,\nyou are meant to be come a great being, do not let anyone stop you.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s&t=2195\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd_ptbiPoXM\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sir+Ken+Robinson\n[4]:

  <p>History and Politics,<br>are not as boring as they may seem at first if you have a good reason to look at them.</p>
  <p>Not everything will make sense,<br>and almost all people will be wrong.</p>
  <p>Just think back to some historical mistake,<br>and look around, the same thing is happening now.</p>
  <p>People think they know, people are certain they know,<br>people blindly believe that we will become right.</p>
  <p>Thinking back to moments of historical crisis,<br>and examining the minds of the majority, is a good tool for thinking.</p>
  <p>Look at the Philosophers, Poets,<br>Artists, Orators and Leaders.</p>

  <p>People look to history for a lot of reasons,<br>and understanding the Mind of Humanity is one of them.</p>
  <p>Understanding the present by subtle analogy to the near past,<br>and perhaps making future projections is a good way to get a good picture of the world.</p>

  <p>History is tough and often sad,<br>but truth is more important than comfort.</p>
  <p>Especially,<br>when future of Humanity Depends on it.</p>

  <p>Along with study of history,<br>comes the study of politics.</p>
  <p>Kurt Vonnegut Jr. has that lovely quote,<br>“True terror is to wake up one morning and realize that your high school class is running the country.”</p>
  <p>Kurt was correct to be concerned, and the way to do him justice, is to fix education,<br>so that Kurt, would be happy to see the wise friends he grew up with running the country.</p>

  <p>Ineffective education has real consequences,<br>because the students who pretend to learn today, will become the leaders of tomorrow.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">In the absence of teachers</a>,<br>we must become the teachers.</p>
  <p>We accomplish this by working towards the most coherent picture of the world,<br>that we can get at.</p>
  <p>It will never feel perfect,<br>in great part because the world is not perfect.</p>
  <p>Governments are just countless people moving in slightly different directions,<br>the thing that makes a difference is them having been enabled with real education and resulting knowledge and wisdom.</p>
  <p>Lack of knowledge and wisdom, along with lack of greatness and restraint,<br>is why world history is stained with tragedies.</p>

  <p>There is a lot of sadness in the past,<br>this is our time now.</p>
  <p>A chance to learn and create a picture of the world,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4IWpMk7esk">help others to the beautiful wise beings we discovered during our own journeys</a>, so that they too may grow.</p>
  <p>Here we have an opportunity to contribute to the prevention of future mistakes,<br>by simply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">rejecting ineffective education</a> and learning in great part from great beings.</p>
  <p>The more we know the faster we learn,<br>and the faster we learn the shorter the road to wisdom.</p>
  <p>This is a great journey, and to earn a balanced view of the world,<br>probably requires decades.</p>
  <p>Knowing where we stand in relation to our world,<br>is an important part of learning about Humanity, and ourselves, and the endless future ahead.</p>

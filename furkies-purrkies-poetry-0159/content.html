  <p>I went bicycling today,</p>
  <p>but I was lost in thoughts all day.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>I thought about Typography and Art,</p>
  <p>and how evey Human Being is really smart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>How people get busy,</p>
  <p>and how life is rarely easy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>How we get tired, how creativity is made,</p>
  <p>otherwise it will just fade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>How there is only ever time for big things,</p>
  <p>it matters not if its vagabonds or kings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>We are all limited in time,</p>
  <p>we truly are meant to learn, become wise and climb.</p>

  <p>Now, I am ready for bed,</p>
  <p>I really feel tired.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I am already packed for my morning run,</p>
  <p>the weather says, no rain, only sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Though, I&apos;ve noticed it will snow,</p>
  <p>at the Rocky Mountains... but that&apos;s good to know.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Because you can&apos;t ever be too far away from that,</p>
  <p>I am pretty far away, and glad.</p>

storm listening to a life changing book, it all becomes clear.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are underestimating yourself,</p>\n  <p>most of us have no idea how powerful we are.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Our only problem is that in the face of not knowing,</p>\n  <p>we can be easily mislead and follow useless paths for years or even decades, such as is the case with ineffective education.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So speak out,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t follow, and don&apos;t be silent.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>With the aid of your classroom friends,</p>\n  <p>make it clear to your teacher that you would rather study things that are relevant to you-personally, that enlighten your path and produce lasting results that you can build on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Read books, begin your self education, and develop the skills necessary to express your concerns about the school just turning you into profits,</p>\n  <p>fill an auditorium, give speeches and talks in multiple schools; become a leader, an inspiration, a Great Being.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Do Not Follow,</p>\n

  "text": "Snow is melting, 38 days until Spring,\nand in just about 18 days everybody starts hitting the Appalachian Tail[1].\nSpring weather could be here in as little,\nas two weeks!\n\nCrossing an I-275 Bicycle Trail overpass today,\nI saw someone trying their wobbly luck.\nWhile I am certain, they didn't get very far,\nthey are certainly not that far off.\n\nIt won't be long before the snow melts,\nthere is a great opportunity awaiting.\nWho will become.\nthe 2021 I-275 Trail Blazer?\n\nYou don't have to go all the way,\njust far enough...\nTo get the motorists wandering,\nif you lost your darn mind.\n\nI recommend a fat tire bicycle,\na thermos with tea and some sweet biscuits, coconut perhaps?\nYou will need, two sets of clothes,\nand you need to wear them both at once.\nGloves, thick furry, fluffy,\nimpervious to adventurer winds gloves, very important.\nAnd something to cover your face,\none way or another it will get cold.\nHopefully, you will ride on a sunny day,\nand of course, you will need an audio book.\nPerhaps you could find something about the Appalachian Tail,\nbe careful with books about expeditions to the poles, as someone always gets in horrible trouble.\nAnd be sure to have a tire repair kit,\njust in case.\n\nYou will have to take plenty of pictures,\nthey always come out very beautifully.\nAnd, if you find any downed trees,\nbeing the Trail Blazer that you are...\nIf the tree is small enough,\nyou're going to have to make a trip to a hardware store.\nFind the sharpest saw,\nand get the tree off the trail, if you can.\nI fixed one of the downed trees after a particularly heavy rain,\nand I still smile to this day, as I proudly pass by the stump I made.\n\nIt will feel like an expedition,\nsnow makes everything seem more distant.\n\nOh, and be careful about the frozen ice,\nthat may hide beneath snow from time to time.\nIt is one of my most fantastic memories of the trail,\nwhen my front tire, simply slid from beneath my bike and I landed with a snowy thud.\nConfused.\nI could feel several motorists think to themselves,\n\"the dumba$$ just fell\".\n\nBut I cared not,\nfor I was in the middle of a rough expedition.\n\nDon't feel bad if you just day dream about it,\nthat is pretty good too, plus, it is always a plus if you don't have to pedal in cold winds.\nBut if you do go for it,\nI hope you will blaze that trail, and many others, every year, from now on.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://atcamp.org/atthruhikerreports.cfm",

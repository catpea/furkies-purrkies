Your light must be a true reflection of Yourself,
so that You may be truly seen and understood.

Do not hide, emulate, simulate, pretend, or serve;
that only disrupts Your light and path.

You are already special enough,
You are a Child of The Universe.

You are meant to become a Great Being through your own journey,
You are meant to bring enlightenment, unseen before.

Please, take good care of Yourself,
You are responsible for Your delicate mind and body.

And take care of Your Elder Self,
so that You may have no regrets come Your Golden Age.

Your Existence, requires that You walk Your own path,
that You lead Your own way.

But the path is not a straight line,
it is more of a flat spiral, you are never far from yourself.

There is so much of You in Your Elder Self,
and there is so much of Your Elder self in You already.

Be good to Her, love Yourself,
be mighty, and authentic.

Never let Yourself down, always rise,
and do not slow down.

Step after step jog mightily forward,
decorate Your Beautiful Journey with Wisdom and Triumph.

May Your elder self, perch upon a porch,
and muse and wonder...

"What a strange Star Child I was,
and how impossibly long my Beautiful Life"

And may You bring Her memories,
of every year in each decade.

Of things You noticed for the first time,
and things You never knew could happen.

And things, that other people never expected of You,
like that year, that you wore a bushy tail - because it made you feel beautiful.

Love Your older self,
make Her smile and wonder.

Make Her love the Younger You,
but fill in all the years completely.

Make sure, that not only is there nothing new to add,
but also that there is nowhere anything could fit.

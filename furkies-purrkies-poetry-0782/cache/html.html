  <p>Use Open Source Krita,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Krita+Tutorial">watch a few beginner tutorials</a>.</p>
  <p>Get a $40-$70 pen and tablet,<br>preferably with the pen tilt feature.</p>
  <p>Tilt, means that when using a virtual chisel tip marker,<br>the tip will actually rotate as you fidget with the pen.</p>
  <p>(Please read the pen and tablet product description carefully, make sure that it ships with all features,<br>and does not require a questionable hardware upgrade.)</p>

  <p>When you do your drawings,<br>you deal with a concept of image layers.</p>
  <p>I go crazy with it,<br>I put each eye on separate layer for example.</p>
  <p>Seasoned Artists, may not do that,<br>which lets them create one layer for shadows another for highlights, simple and easy.</p>

  <p>On top of that, Krita has a useful and simple to use Image Reference Tool,<br>which lives in its own world, above your standard layers.</p>

  <p>If you are like me, with all this art talk,<br>you may think to yourself “but I can’t even draw a stick figure”.</p>
  <p>I absolutely feel the same way,<br>in school when we started stick figures in first grade.</p>
  <p>I did my stick figure without arms,<br>because I got to excited about the smiley face, and just forgot the freaking arms.</p>
  <p>The teacher looked at me in shame,<br>and from that point on I knew teachers were <em>&%</em> useless.</p>

  <p>Krita’s Image Reference Layer,<br>will project a reference image on your canvas.</p>
  <p>So, take a selfie,<br>use the Image Reference Tool to load it, and stretch it across the <strong>entire</strong> canvas.</p>
  <p>Be sure to set the opacity to 20% or 50%,<br>now use a Air Brush to paint through the Image Reference Layer onto your canvas or layer stack.</p>
  <p>See it is like using an office projector on a wall,<br>it tells you where everything goes, and there is no way you will forget the arms.</p>

  <p>Now, the color picker,<br>will not pick colors through the image Reference Layer.</p>
  <p>It will only ever sample the colors,<br>from the reference image you stretched over you canvas.</p>
  <p>So not only do you have perfect shape reference,<br>you also have access to the exact color you need...</p>
  <p>In the spot that you need it,<br>and the color it is not impacted by the transparent of the reference layer.</p>

  <p>There is no simpler, faster and more pleasant way to study color and shape,<br>than intimately working with reference photos.</p>
  <p>And finally, make sure your reference photos,<br>have good resolution.</p>
  <p>A quick way to verify resolution,<br>is to check if you can see separate eyelashes in your reference photo.</p>
  <p>If you can see them,<br>then you can learn how to paint them right.</p>

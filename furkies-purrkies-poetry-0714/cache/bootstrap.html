    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was getting around to painting my favorite gym photo,<br>but I still had a problem with painting eyes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So I felt like I needed one more practice test,<br>I remembered "Reddit Gets Drawn" from my days of I will never draw like that...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And while I am not a fan of social media,<br>there was a photo with good eyes I could practice on.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I am sure the internet stranger I painted,<br>will like it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This was a very fun, but also exhausting challenge,<br>it probably took six or eight hours, and I had to get everything perfect in a single sitting.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The color palette approach, that I am just going to call Cat Pea Technique,<br>to keep things simple, worked flawlessly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I did pre-process the image in GIMP,<br>enraging the eyes, making the mouth smaller, and above all to get a preview.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It was a very rough sketch,<br>it took 10 minutes, it had double eyebrows, things were overlapping...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But it was perfect,<br>it delivered, a preview, a rough outline of where the eyes, nose, ear, lips need to be; and of course; the color map.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You just can't go wrong,<br>when you already have everything as you start painting.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The person just did big blobs of paint,<br>I think they were using a reference image over the entire canvas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I suspect everyone maybe doing it,<br>I wish this was more well known.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is so sad that there are people out there,<br>who tried digital painting, and gave up, because they didn't know to stretch the reference image over the entire canvas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Both for color,<br>and proportions.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I did solve the eye problem, I was stylizing them too much,<br>I can't just cut out a circle to make an iris - I needed to do it freehand, with an airbrush, like a landscape.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The uncanny valley effect was caused by perfection in the eyes,<br>paintings are meant to be flawed.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You don't need hand eye coordination,<br>you don't need to use grids, just stretch out the reference image over your entire canvas, and set opacity to 50% and start painting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once you get all the big blobs of paint in,<br>once you have your eyes, iris, eyelids, nose highlights and nose holes, upper lip, the dividing shadow, lower lip.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once you stop needing positioning information,<br>then drop the opacity of your reference image to 1%.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At 1% it is invisible to you,<br>but it will still respond to your color picker.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So as you do eyelid details, you just click the color picker in an era that feel wrong to you,<br>and you will get the color from the reference image - you will get the color that you should use for that spot.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But the pressure sensor at the tip of the pen,<br>will let you slowly apply the color.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The mouse will just dump it in there,<br>but if you press gently with the pen, you will slowly apply the color - that is the painting part.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is also why it is not paint by number,<br>because you are still using your heart, stylizing how much color you want in there.</div>

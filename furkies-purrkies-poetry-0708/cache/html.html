  <p>All the tutorials show you how,<br>some mention how many sittings (or painting sessions).</p>
  <p>But few tell you that you just paint one part a day,<br>and sometimes you shouldn't even finish.</p>
  <p>The aim must never be to paint a Mona Lisa,<br>but rather to have a wonderful time painting some small part of her.</p>
  <p>If you sit down to paint a whole Mona Lisa,<br>all the parts will cross and overlay, and kick you out.</p>
  <p>Worst yet, you may trick yourself that you can't paint very well,<br>and not return to painting for decades - or ever.</p>

  <p>Personally, I prefer to outline a portrait first,<br>and I don't want to use any tricks, just go free hand.</p>
  <p>Unless, I need to hurry,<br>if there is no time, then you just overlay the thing an trace the outlines.</p>
  <p>You should also trace when painting a portrait,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnd4CtXmQTE">as it is less surprising to hand in a realistic portrait</a>.</p>
  <p>In my opinion the work of the artist is more important than the subject,<br>art is a super-set of reality.</p>
  <p>But creating an impression of a subject,<br>and creating a portrait of a subject, are two separate roads.</p>

  <p>As to whether to paint with Oils or Digital,<br>the answer is learn both, as one will teach you about the other.</p>
  <p>But if you are just starting, use Krita and a $40 Digital Tablet,<br>as all you have to do to start, is sit in front of your computer.</p>
  <p>As you can imagine, digital paint simulates oil paint,<br>but is infinitely more forgiving.</p>
  <p>Press the "E" key to put your brush into eraser mode,<br>and with a single swipe you can redo the problem area.</p>
  <p>Let me put it this way,<br>and if there is one thing you take away from all this, remember this: "Digital Painting Loves You".</p>
  <p>And if you take away two things, oh my gosh, there is something so important that can trip you up here,<br>DON'T USE THE MOUSE TO PAINT, I know you think you can, but you can't - IT HAS NO PRESSURE SENSOR, just get the damn $40 tablet.</p>

  <p>Now, when you do sit down to painting just the eyes for the evening,<br>people will advise yo to follow some system.</p>
  <p>There is no system, you simply need to paint what you feel is the next step,<br>on a separate layer.</p>
  <p>Just press the insert key,<br>and start working on the next hing you feel you need to add to the eyes.</p>
  <p>If you need to restart, press the "DEL" key, to clear the entire layer,<br>and if you feel you went to far...</p>
  <p>And for example, you don't need to keep eye lashes and eye-shadow makeup on separate layers,<br>just press ctrl-e to merge the layers, and never think about it again.</p>
  <p>Just remember for the next time,<br>that you don't need to get fancy with eye-lashes and eye shadows.</p>
  <p>So it is not a system, though you probably want to doddle an outline on the first layer,<br>and then just keep adding colors and details.</p>
  <p>Decades ago, in a speed painting video I found in a magazine or similar,<br>I saw a person avoid outlines, and just start by laying down wide brushes of color.</p>
  <p>Eventually you'll find comfort in some pattern,<br>but you should never call it a system, and teaching it could cause discomfort and confusion to your students.</p>

  <p>In conclusion I would like to explain something,<br>about the title image.</p>
  <p>You are in fact not seeing a progression of steps,<br>not exactly.</p>
  <p>What I am doing here,<br>is turning on all the layers that make up my Mona Lisa's eyes.</p>
  <p>From my initial sketch,<br>all the way out to make up and eyebrows.</p>
  <p>To be more precise, the layer with reflections over the iris,<br>is just four little swipes of white, that would not make much sense on their own.</p>
  <p>So one by one, I am turning on the layers or eye-details on each layer,<br>that eventually create the eyes.</p>
  <p>If I feel that something is missing,<br>I can easily go back and add it, as each detail is isolated on it's own layer.</p>
  <p>For example the third layer over the more defined sketch,<br>that gives the eyeballs roundness, could use a little bit of blur.</p>
  <p>If I used a blur tool on that layer,<br>to even out the progression between the light browns.</p>
  <p>It would have no impact what so ever on the sharpness of the underlying sketch,<br>or the details overlaying star background to the iris.</p>
  <p>This is too complex to create some kind of a system,<br>I simply isolate things on their own layers.</p>
  <p>I work with them later on,<br>I won't smudge or damage anything else.</p>

  <p>Some years ago,<br>I woke up and said whoa!</p>
  <p>For I knew I was ready,<br>to get on my bicycle and ride steady.</p>
  <p>The hour was 4 am,<br>I got ready and bam!</p>
  <p>I was headed for lake Erie,<br>and was feeling pretty cheery.</p>
  <p>I had my water and traimix,<br>and my phone to take some pix.</p>
  <p>The sun came up real soon,<br>and before I knew it was as noon.</p>
  <p>I knew how to get to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XUvtwNiKvNC2imYy6">Flatrock</a>,<br>as I once discovered it with a shock.</p>
  <p>There was a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3BNSyheqeoxewxT6A">strange secret passage in a park</a>,<br>but past that point I was in the dark.</p>

  <p>I asked "How to get to the lake?",<br>a man pointed a finger and gave his head a shake.</p>
  <p>So I got back on my iron horse,<br>and set a new course.</p>
  <p>I was headed east,<br>or so I thought at least.</p>

  <p>I got lost and discovered a cute coffee shop,<br>but I didn't have time to stop.</p>
  <p>I sped up and down the road,<br>in my detective mode.</p>
  <p>There was a sign,<br>but no coastline!</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>Moment later I was lost,<br>I mumbled, "Where is that darn coast?"</p>
  <p>But I kept going,<br>and I wasn't slowing.</p>
  <p>There were train tracks,<br>and sidewalks full of cracks.</p>
  <p>There was a road full of cars,<br>and abandoned bars.</p>
  <p>And finally a paved little trail,<br>that started by the local rail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I got on it and pedaled some more,<br>and then before I knew it I made it to the shore.</p>
  <p>It came out of nowhere,<br>it almost seemed unfair.</p>
  <p>I perched upon a pier,<br>and exclaimed "Oh Dear"</p>
  <p>The lake was very pretty,<br>as was the little city.</p>
  <p>But now,<br>I had to get back and I wasn't sure how.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I stuffed my cheeks,<br>full of trail-mix.</p>
  <p>And headed west,<br>back to my nest.</p>
  <p>It was twice as hard to bet back,<br>and I could really feel the weight of my pack.</p>
  <p>I made it out of the park,<br>but it was already getting dark.</p>
  <p>I got back very late,<br>but I felt great.</p>
  <p>I would rate the adventure 10/10,<br>never again.</p>

Some years ago,
I woke up and said whoa!

For I knew I was ready,
to get on my bicycle and ride steady.

The hour was 4 am,
I got ready and bam!

I was headed for lake Erie,
and was feeling pretty cheery.

I had my water and traimix,
and my phone to take some pix.

The sun came up real soon,
and before I knew it was as noon.

I knew how to get to [Flatrock][1],
as I once discovered it with a shock.

There was a [strange secret passage in a park][2],
but past that point I was in the dark.

---

I asked "How to get to the lake?",
a man pointed a finger and gave his head a shake.

So I got back on my iron horse,
and set a new course.

I was headed east,
or so I thought at least.

---

I got lost and discovered a cute coffee shop,
but I didn't have time to stop.

I sped up and down the road,
in my detective mode.

There was a sign,
but no coastline!

---

Moment later I was lost,
I mumbled, "Where is that darn coast?"

But I kept going,
and I wasn't slowing.

There were train tracks,
and sidewalks full of cracks.

There was a road full of cars,
and abandoned bars.

And finally a paved little trail,
that started by the local rail.

---

I got on it and pedaled some more,
and then before I knew it I made it to the shore.

It came out of nowhere,
it almost seemed unfair.

I perched upon a pier,
and exclaimed "Oh Dear"

The lake was very pretty,
as was the little city.

But now,
I had to get back and I wasn't sure how.

---

I stuffed my cheeks,
full of trail-mix.

And headed west,
back to my nest.

It was twice as hard to bet back,
and I could really feel the weight of my pack.

I made it out of the park,
but it was already getting dark.

I got back very late,
but I felt great.

I would rate the adventure 10/10,
never again.

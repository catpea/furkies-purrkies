    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A low tech light bulb, mirror and lens thing,<br>that is perfectly built for projecting a photograph an a wall.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The standard office or home projector,<br>used for presentations and watching movies.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But by far the most useful computer trick,<br>is lowering the number of colors in your photo, often called posterize.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This will help you see where,<br>and WHAT! the shadows really look like.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A face is not an oval with a nose,<br>it is composed out of layers of shadows, basically.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once you can see where the shadows start and end,<br>deepen and lighten...</div>

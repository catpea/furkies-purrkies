  <p>When I was little I had a portrait drawn of me,<br>and though it was very nice it didn't capture my face exactly.</p>
  <p>I am not complaining,<br>I am just saying.</p>

  <p>This is why I emphasize the need for projectors,<br>and there are three types of projectors.</p>
  <p>A low tech light bulb, mirror and lens thing,<br>that is perfectly built for projecting a photograph an a wall.</p>
  <p>The standard office or home projector,<br>used for presentations and watching movies.</p>
  <p>And and pico projector,<br>one that plugs into your phone.</p>

  <p>If you have good portrait photos,<br>and you don't want to use your projector too much.</p>
  <p>Get the low tech one, they are very inexpensive,<br>but remember your photograph needs to be good.</p>

  <p>For comfort, get a home or office projector,<br>these are the brightest and have the highest resolutions.</p>
  <p>Pico projectors work just fine,<br>but they are not as bright, you will need to use it at night.</p>
  <p>The big deal about digital projectors,<br>is that you can edit the photo.</p>
  <p>Cropping your source image is a big deal,<br>and so is adjusting brightness and contrast.</p>
  <p>But by far the most useful computer trick,<br>is lowering the number of colors in your photo, often called posterize.</p>
  <p>This will help you see where,<br>and WHAT! the shadows really look like.</p>
  <p>A face is not an oval with a nose,<br>it is composed out of layers of shadows, basically.</p>
  <p>Once you can see where the shadows start and end,<br>deepen and lighten...</p>
  <p>...you can then capture the soul,<br>of the person you are drawing or painting.</p>

  <p>Start with pencils, and blending stumps,<br>art pencils have a range of useful tones.</p>
  <p>But try painting on canvas as well,<br>or wood panes from a local hardware store.</p>

  <p>There is nothing to stop you from becoming an artist now,<br>but there is one more big step.</p>
  <p>You have to exhibit your art,<br>business offices, coffee shops, galleries and shows at the local museum.</p>
  <p>For those of you asking what is the point,<br>the point is a taste of greatness you get at your first big show.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>More than that, your show is also your guide,<br>when you feel that you have finished...</p>
  <p>You may ask your self,<br>is this good enough for the gallery.</p>
  <p>And this may lead you to realize,<br>that the darker side of the person's face you just painted, feels empty, because it was just a shadow.</p>
  <p>You will need to re-shoot the photo,<br>with the person having sparkling water droplets on their face,</p>
  <p>Learn to paint them,<br>and add them in to your painting.</p>
  <p>When you take a source photo,<br>you will now ask yourself: "Is this good enough for a painting I can exhibit at a show."</p>
  <p>"Is there too much of a flat area,<br>should I return in the morning, when the sun passes through the currently flat trees."</p>

  <p>You will find your own way,<br>for example in conquering color mixing; you may pick blue for the next 20 paintings.</p>
  <p>People will call it your blue phase,<br>when you understand blue you may add red and that may become a topic for another exhibition.</p>
  <p>At some point you will also begin mixing and composing,<br>adding butterflies, castles, werewolves, or a sky from a different planet in the background.</p>
  <p>Something interesting will call to you,<br>and the theme will become your friend, and part of your style.</p>

  <p>I will close with a silly warning,<br>I am a fan Perrier the sparkling water.</p>
  <p>And while having a sip of the bubbly thing,<br>I noticed that my four foot rectangular canvas was perfect for a small bottle of Perrier.</p>
  <p>I really enjoyed painting it,<br>and the color was just perfect.</p>
  <p>However, when I exhibited my art, some fiend, scribbled,<br>"Andy Warhol" on the paper label beneath my painting.</p>
  <p>I thought of his can of Campbell's piece, and immediately googled Warhol and Perrier,<br><a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/93248/perrier">whoopsie, I was not the first to frame a bottle of Perrier</a> - lesson learned.</p>

  <p>Make an art out of finding amazing things to draw and paint,<br>dive deeply to create both memorable photographs, and paintings.</p>
  <p>And make sure you create enough artworks to fill a coffee-table book,<br>or an art manual where you can show your process, sketches, and photos too.</p>
  <p>Remember, don't be a chapter,<br>fill the entire book.</p>

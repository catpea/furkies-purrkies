    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Elements of stylization such as glowing eye techniques, or face highlights,<br>or playing with camera focus are perfectly awesome superpowers as well.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As the case is with highlights of the cheek, nose and lip, possibly forehead,<br>Hyperrealism is more than just realism.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Hyperealism unlike a mere photo,<br>captures the way the image is processed by our minds.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And as you progress beyond the wonders of Hyperrealism,<br>you will be stepping into a world of uncharted superpowers.</div>

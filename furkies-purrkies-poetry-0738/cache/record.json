  "text": "Please understand that Superpowers are... real,\nbut the real ones are a magnitude more profound than the stuff in the comics.\nHyperrealism or Fantasy Art is a superpower,\nand so is selling your art, selling creations that come from your heart.\n\nTeaching! Hyperrealism and Stylization,\nis extremely powerful as it helps people out of poverty.\nElements of stylization such as glowing eye techniques, or face highlights,\nor playing with camera focus are perfectly awesome superpowers as well.\nAs the case is with highlights of the cheek, nose and lip, possibly forehead,\nHyperrealism is more than just realism.\nHyperealism unlike a mere photo,\ncaptures the way the image is processed by our minds.\nAnd as you progress beyond the wonders of Hyperrealism,\nyou will be stepping into a world of uncharted superpowers.\n\nYou will actually need a real and fancy journal,\nso that you can write things down.\nThere will be hundreds of things here,\nnot just glowing eye styles but notes on times of day, and backgrounds.\nTo make eyes glow brighter for example,\nyou don't use a brighter color, nuh uh.\nYou put your character in the middle of dark woods,\namong cheerful fireflies and maybe a patch of foxfire.\nWhat better way to show a bright light,\nthan to make it shine at night.\nAnd to capture a sunset,\ngoodness - you don't put a sun in your painting...\nYou highlight the ear\nso that it glows red, as if lit by a bright sun\nHundreds, and hundreds of things,\nand not so much about the stricture of the head for example.\nBut, just, where the most meaningful shadows and highlights go,\nthat make portraits come to life...\nAnd not just in your hands,\nyour journal stands for more...\n\nCan you imagine it?\nIt is a deep and dark December,\nyour defiant heals are clicking on cold concrete.\nMight as well trade your biggest purse for a backpack,\nyou brought a bunch of tablets with you.\nYou feel footsteps behind you, you try to ignore it,\nso you keep it cool and ponder the backup tablets you brought just in case.\nBut eventually,\nyou just have to look.\nAnd it is the cheery eyed lady with the sweet accent,\nthat always shows up first in class and never says anything.\nBut she hears your every word,\nwith awe.\nHer nose is red,\nand that totally just made half your lecture about noses.\nAnd she has her tablet under her arm,\nyou smile, she smiles, the universe smiles, and the future of the human kind if brighter for it.\n\nYou are on a mission,\nas far as you can tell School/craft won't call you back next semester.\nSo you set your mind on getting theses kids,\nfrom zero to hero every lecture.\nAnd it may not be clear to you,\nbut your two first lectures left them freaking the heck out.\nOrientation is supposed to go slow mo,\nbut you showed up few hours early and set-up Krita and all the tablets ... which cost you $1,100 dollars -- but f**k it, cause your class is a work of art too.\nAnd all of them did setup with art sellers,\nand some art was bought, mostly parents, but it absolutley counts.\n\nYour third lecture,\nwill show every one of your students through and through, that they don't have to be scared of poverty anymore.\nThey can see the road,\nunbeknownst to you - the young lady behind you is about to make a sale during your lecture.\nEveryone will just pause,\nthey will look at your rosy smiling face, and the portrait that was sold, and the young lady squeaking with delight, and back to the smiling you.\nOn your fourth lecture,\nyou will read out a note from the customer, that they had the portrait printed on a canvas and that they love it.\n\nAll of your twelve lectures,\nmake the kids speechless, as you armed each of your meetings with real results.\nAnd you are constantly interrupted,\nby squeaks of new sales.\n\nThe two girls in middle row that were talking on the first lecture,\nuntil they saw how easy portraits are.\nThey actually end up teaching digital art at Peace Corps,\nand later on, end up with a huge fashion design studio.\n\nNot only will they never forget you,\nbut they too become teachers.\nCertainly for their friends,\nbut also, one teaches at UofM, and another started her own art school.\nThe cheery young lady,\nends up working at the UN...\nAnd nothing she does, is without that start-and-end punch,\nthat you taught her.\nShe'll talk about you for decades,\n\"Not only did she make each lecture meaningful, but she showed us we were not poor.\"\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche caught on the importance of art,\n\"Art is the proper task of life.\" - Mindful and meaningful life.\nArt was never about the works, ever,\nit was always about harnessing the power to change the world - about building bridges to greater places.\nHere you taught your students a way out of poverty,\nand they took that beyond anything that you could have grasped,\nYou changed their world,\nand in return they changed the world in a way that kept all, away from the terrors of poverty.",

  <p>I suppose this is something that the birds have missed,<br>I am a really nice cyclist.</p>
  <p>All the people I warn of the angry birds,<br>can't believe my words.</p>
  <p>They have never experienced any attacks,<br>I am the only one paying the bird toll and tax.</p>

  <p>I bicycled back there today,<br>and the moment I looked up they all flew away.</p>
  <p>It is summer and I wanted to get a bit tanned,<br>so I cut myself a switch, held a twig in my hand.</p>
  <p>But this is no way to ride a bicycle,<br>why are their hearts as cold as an icicle.</p>

  <p>I think they saw my twig and a half,<br>and just had a good laugh.</p>
  <p>Birds are evolved from Dinosaurs, aka Terrible Lizards,<br>maybe that is why they are so up in their gizzards,</p>
  <p>It certainly isn't my fault,<br>and no man should suffer birds assault.</p>

  <p>I ride by that ugly tree every year,<br>and I think what these birds want is just fear.</p>
  <p>They are certainly not protecting their little babies,<br>I think they all just have rabies.</p>
  <p>Or just entertain themselves with those that strike some chord,<br>because they are really bored.</p>

  <p>When I got by passed them without attack, I smirked,<br>that twig with me worked.</p>
  <p>So, if you are ever bothered by bird or two,<br>you don't have to be blue.</p>
  <p>When the birds come just get mad,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWGiWHwmhhc">wiggle a little twig above your head</a>.</p>

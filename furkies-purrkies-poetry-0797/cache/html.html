  <p>Real education is about,<br>entering the class of learning.</p>
  <p>Documentaries are great,<br>so as long as they are built on facts.</p>
  <p>Worlds most beloved books,<br>are better.</p>
  <p>As they are loved,<br>for their wisdom.</p>

  <p>As with everything,<br>people will come to tell you Science Popularizers can’t teach.</p>
  <p>That you can’t get an education,<br>out of a fun book.</p>

  <p>They’ll hold up math as proof,<br>thinking it will stick.</p>
  <p>But they don’t know math,<br>and those who do, know the most boring side of it.</p>
  <p>To know mathematics,<br>means to synthesize new ideas.</p>
  <p>Even, if those ideas were had before,<br>synthesis will eventually take you out into Terra Incognita.</p>
  <p>To get started with that,<br>begin building a universe with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLglp04UYZK_PrN6xWo_nJ-8kzyXDyFUwi">P5.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">Math As Code</a>.</p>
  <p>You don’t have to build a simulation, create pixel art games,<br>build a game around concepts in Physics.</p>
  <p>Warping space to move faster than light, traveling at near light speed,<br>superluminal motion and relativity, paradoxes in physics, and even listing to radio signals.</p>
  <p>And to get into the zone,<br>just start by making platformed.</p>
  <p>You can see, without me trying to convince you,<br>how fun, mysterious, and fascinating math is when you learn for real.</p>

  <p>But before all this, get mad or at least become suspicions,<br>about people with all the answers.</p>
  <p>Because being given all the answers without thinking or effort,<br>is often an attack with the aim of preventing you from asking real questions.</p>
  <p>When you don’t ask questions, and when you don’t question results,<br>you become a tool to make other people’s creepy lives easier.</p>

  <p>Finally, don’t just start by just listening to a neat book,<br>start by buying a backpack, and slowly fill it with neat and mysterious camping things.</p>
  <p>You don’t have to go far.<br>Setting up camp and spending a day taking pictures at a local State Park...</p>
  <p>While listening to your favorite books;<br>is perfect - so as long as you bring some fruit and have a picnic too.</p>

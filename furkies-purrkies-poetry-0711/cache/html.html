  <p>Off the top of my head I can think of,<br>Krita's Reference Image Picking, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwpEpnjXr3k">Wall Projectors</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s_Oia63yns">Graphite Paper</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwX1FwumFNI">Tracing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqiUeW9AN5Q">Pouncing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJJo5uVNOBo">Dark Room</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oRnBA6Azd8">Perspectographs</a>.</p>
  <p>All of this techniques,<br>are beautiful and ingenious - and they are art.</p>

  <p>Krita, has a feature called Reference Images Tool,<br>and when you stretch a reference image over your entire canvas, and make it invisible by setting opacity to 1 percent.</p>
  <p>Something magical happens,<br>and this thing give you the superpower to become an artist right now.</p>
  <p>The reference layer is a layer above all other layers,<br>it lives in its own untouchable universe above all else.</p>
  <p>When you have an invisible reference image stretched over your canvas,<br>the color picker won't care that the opacity is just 1 percent - it will only pick colors from the reference layer.</p>
  <p>That means when you use a color picker, even in an empty area of your canvas,<br>you will pick the REAL color from the reference image, even though the opacity of the reference image is at 1 percent.</p>
  <p>Press "B" to switch to your brush tool, and when you need a real color,<br>just hold control and pick.</p>
  <p>Though your canvas maybe empty, or pink like mine always is,<br>it does not matter, yo still get the real color from your invisible reference image.</p>
  <p>This is a superpower that would make, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo,<br>quit.</p>

  <p>You can open up your own Art Studio,<br>and sell perfect portraits while you study and master adding extra beauty to them.</p>
  <p>If you feel that art is not in the trace,<br>then it is surely in what you do to and around it.</p>
  <p>But I assure you, tracing portraits is it,<br>tracing is also a magnificent teacher.</p>

  <p>There is a second point I should try to note here,<br>when you begin tracing it becomes the loveliest teacher - that can take you from beginner on up.</p>
  <p>Please don't start with copying by eye, or some hand-eye-coordination practice,<br>there are other lessons to be had first - and you find them all in tracing.</p>

  <p>Order an inexpensive (about $40) pen and tablet,<br>and take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Krita+Tutorial">Krita Tutorial</a>.</p>
  <p>And begin taking commissions,<br>be it a week a month or a year, or a decade, or several - we need to create art the same way that we need to leave our journals behind.</p>
  <p>Our art is an important picture of our soul,<br>one that is worth a million unspoken words, when all there is left is journals.</p>
  <p>Take to art, make Photo Realism your first step,<br>and then travel countless many more.</p>

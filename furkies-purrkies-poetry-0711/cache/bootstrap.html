    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Krita, has a feature called Reference Images Tool,<br>and when you stretch a reference image over your entire canvas, and make it invisible by setting opacity to 1 percent.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Something magical happens,<br>and this thing give you the superpower to become an artist right now.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The reference layer is a layer above all other layers,<br>it lives in its own untouchable universe above all else.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When you have an invisible reference image stretched over your canvas,<br>the color picker won't care that the opacity is just 1 percent - it will only pick colors from the reference layer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That means when you use a color picker, even in an empty area of your canvas,<br>you will pick the REAL color from the reference image, even though the opacity of the reference image is at 1 percent.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Press "B" to switch to your brush tool, and when you need a real color,<br>just hold control and pick.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though your canvas maybe empty, or pink like mine always is,<br>it does not matter, yo still get the real color from your invisible reference image.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is a superpower that would make, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo,<br>quit.</div>

time,</p>\n  <p>for learning life.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Learning by subtle analogy,</p>\n  <p>to the smaller Triumph, and Success.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Stick to a single subject,</p>\n  <p>until you fill it completely.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now you can hang it up at the coffee shop,</p>\n  <p>but keep moving

 <p>and there is nowhere to go, or you can&apos;t go into enough places.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That is an illusion,</p>\n  <p>all those paths are false.</p>\n</div>\n<div

point.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The world may shake and shudder,</p>\n  <p>and there will be &quot;Why?&quot;, and &quot;How could you?&quot;, and &quot;What is going on?&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All those cries,</p>\n  <p>are for the person that follows.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Each asking you to a different path,</p>\n  <p>and all those paths are mutually incompatible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Do you see,</p>\n  <p>life wants you to merely be.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But you <em>can</em> be more,</p>\n  <p>you don&apos;t have to call it Growing Up, Courage, Authenticity or Growing Content of Character.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Call it, and appointment at D.I.A.</p>\n  <p>call it, a meeting at the UofM Museum of Natural History.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Begin keeping a Moleskine Journal,</p>\n  <p>use a pencil,</p>\n  <p>only draw what your heart sees,</p>\n  <p>and write as little as possible,</p>\n  <p>write to your older self,</p>\n  <p>explain to her why?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Find your center,</p>\n  <p>find your balance.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Lean on your Nucleus,</p>\n  <p>and push off to take your steps in your own direction.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Calm your hand,</p>\n  <p>slow your time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There are decades ahead,</p>\n  <p>and you have to be seen.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Show yourself,</p>\n  <p>create future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What others have, may shine,</p>\n  <p>but is not always gold they keep.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The younger we are,</p>\n  <p>the less wisdom we hold;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The less wisdom,</p>\n  <p>the more questions we should answer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And questions combined with life,</p>\n  <p>make for a busy time in deed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So slow down,</p>\n  <p>answer your questions - first.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All life is sacred,</p>\n  <p>all Lifelines equally matter.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But not all will arrive at their Golden Age of Wisdom,</p>\n  <p>without regrets.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So, please,</p>\n  <p>ask your older self what her regrets are.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And the higher you grow, the more you know, and which is more,</p>\n  <p>the more in harmony with your older-self, you&apos;ll be.</p>\n</div>",

Your great strength is yours only,
it is for you so that you may live a beautiful and meaningful life.

It cannot be sold or rented,
because it is priceless.

Nor, can you give it away,
under any circumstance.

Everybody that has something to gain,
will try to push you to work past your limit.

You can't allow that,
your life is not meant to be spent on work.

You should only work enough,
so that you are safe.

It is hard to keep a balanced existence,
but we must always search and never give in.

We are not machines, nor cogs in one,
we are Music, Poetry, Great Thinker and Dreamers.

We have to protect what makes us beautiful,
overwork can only prevent us from fixing the world.

We are each meant to become well-read,
knowledgeable, wise and an outspoken inspiration to many.

The younger generations are always in need of Great Teachers,
as they all to easily accept the status quo.

All the world nations require great improvement,
and to change the world, we can only rely on Wisdom.

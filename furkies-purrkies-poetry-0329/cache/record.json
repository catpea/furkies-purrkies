(paraphrasing Renaissance Man) and your content of character (MLK Jr.)</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Authenticity,</p>\n  <p>will always add.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Inauthenticity,</p>\n  <p>will always replace some important part of you with blank space.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And compromise, compromise never adds anything to goodness,</p>\n  <p>it can only take from goodness and empower some damn evil (paraphrasing Ayn Rand&apos;s John Galt speech).</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div

age,</p>\n  <p>may an urge to write your books become unstoppable.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And may all your hard earned wisdom add to make your aches count for even more,</p>\n  <p>by helping countless others to start, where you left off.</p>\n</div>",

  "text": "You may not realize that the way you have been treated in school,\nhas been slowly turning you away from knowledge and wisdom.\nSee, the teachers convinced us all that what they are doing is sharing knowledge,\nbut it is actually the opposite of knowledge that they are sharing.\nReal knowledge comes with real results,\nfake knowledge depends on making you feel perpetually inadequate and then squeezes you into desperation just to make you thing you made progress as it pushes you along.\n\nReal knowledge brings Happiness,\nit makes you ridiculous with your inventions.\nWith every cheerfully useless invention,\nyou learn something priceless, and create an unspeakably beautiful addition to your Portfolio.\n\nAs to the fantasy of good grades and good jobs.\nYou shouldn't be surprised that the people who cram and memorize, do get the best jobs but only by cheating and lying, and manipulating, and by being well connected,\nthus, destroying the environments, and the very goodness of that position by creating that toxic environment.\nWe can all imagine that one perfect job, where creativity is cherished above all,\nand they would never hire a liar, because liars are toxic.\nAnd we all need to stop with the fantasies,\nthose jobs only exist when the company is forming, once they get that $100M venture capitol, only those who perform at maximum will be kept, and only until they burn out.\nNo, no, no.\nIt is not cool to live in the office drinking free energy drinks and writing your best code ever.\nYou need wisdom, balance, knowledge, dignity, Content of Character,\nbeing quirky in a high powered job where the suits don't even speak your language is not cool.\nAll these people that you think don't get it, have negotiated contracts with expensive lawyers, and guaranteed golden parachutes,\nyou are still the little guy, no matter how big your code.\nAs sweet as those memories are,\nthe job is not the point, our lives are meant to be lived in great dignity and wisdom, with great foresight and onward to creating a body of knowledge that will make lasting contributions to Human Kind.\nYou have to Think Big,\nthere is no other way.\n\nIf there are temporary exceptions, the exceptions want you to have a real education,\nthey want you to fight for real knowledge, so that they may love you for helping them grow.\nA 4.0 GPA has go nothing to do with those exceptions,\nmemorization and cramming will prevent you from getting into one of those rare situations, even if you do come across it (most of us won't)\n\nFor you High School or maybe Middle School, or even college poses a confusing challenge,\nas you detect it is not possible to get an education because everything is too disconnected and you must memorize or you fail classes and destroy your GPA.\nBut for someone who is comfortable with lying,\npretending to get an education, to get a dream job, is a dream come true.\nThey actually make that dumb fantasy happen,\nbut that life is stressful, unstable, and a house of cards.\nLying is like living life in a VR helmet,\nthey aren't actually there, making that progress, they are still in High School, lying, pretending, still a kid.\n\nForget the fantasy of getting a good job for getting good grades,\nbuild your own companies, become an entrepreneur, the sooner the better.\nIt is too unstable,\nlife it too precious, and there are way too many moody people in your way, not to mention the liars.\n\nAnd no, graduating from MIT is still part of the same fantasy,\nyou can't cram, it does not work, it doesn't do anything for your mind, you just end up with debt.\nBrand-name colleges are not in the business of restoring authenticity to the world,\nthey are in the business of staying in business and making people's education look rare and prestigious so that they can stick their foot in some door.\n\nAnd a full ride scholarship, is never a full ride, they'll still make money of of you,\nor you will have to cram double and learn even less to graduate on time before it all expires.\nThe only way to win,\nis not to play.\nI know what you are thinking, the Dean, surely the Dean is honest,\nthe Dean will help you, they will see the goodness of your heart, that is what they are there for...\nSurely.\nI believe that too, and with tears in my eyes,\nthat there are people up there that can help all of us, that they moment they see our hearts, they will never betray us.\n\nBut we need to,\nsnap out of it!\nListen up, listen,\nthe only way - is to built your own way.\nFind the right Audio Books,\nand begin building your own companies, until you learn how to do it right,\nForget the stupid fantasies,\nuse them as a way to recognize signs of being misled.\nThere is no diploma, there is no cake, the lady can't sing,\nit is just lies and liars, because they always, albeit temporarily, out compete the good people.\n\nThe only way to win is not to play in a game where a liar always has unlimited advantage.\n\nNow listen carefully, eventually,\nyou will become thirty five years old.\nIt happens to all of us,\nfew years before the middle age, we kind of slow down and take a look at ourselves.\nIt is always an amazing experience,\nyou get to see that you are more of yourself... you get to witness yourself.\nYou are almost able to keep extending that measuring stick,\nto kind of get an idea of where the heck you are headed, and what regrets may be, and what your elder-self is constantly complains about.\nOnce the 20s are over,\nyou enter your age of enlightenment, where you get to synthesize new things out of what you have learned.\n\nWe learn best from connecting with great stories of Discovery and Adventure,\nand inhering the minds and independence of those heroes.\nIs it a big deal to learn for real,\ngetting to 35 on empty is scary.\nIt happens to good people too, often very delicate people get mislead by all this complexity, but they catch up very quickly,\nbeing strong and cheerful in a world of lies, still represents a hell of an education.\n\nAt 40, it is time to begin polishing our wisdom,\nand trying to find the best and most creative way to share.\nAt 40, we get to a point, where it becomes really meaningful,\nto share our knowledge, and create the works that help young people.\nLiars end up in the beginning,\nthey need to start learning from scratch, that is that mad circle.\nBut those who have taken to learning for real, who have great experiences to distill into wisdom,\nbegin preparing for the biggest task of their next 40 years, sharing their ever growing body of wisdom.\n\nNot everyone will like your books,\nthey will appreciate it, but also find it mostly wrong, that is OK.\nIt is the people who get launched 20 years ahead\nby inheriting from your works that matter here.\nThey are your readers,\nand they will find you to be a friend in time, and a part of their extended family.\nI can't stress this enough here, they need real knowledge, and an authentic struggle for real knowledge,\nthey won't be impressed with your cramming for tests to keep a good GPA.\n\nEverything you do from middle school on,\nmust be strong and authentic, because you will need it later in your life.\nYou will rely on your Content of Character,\nso it must be unshakable.\nRemember, each choice you make,\neither adds or takes away from you.\nAll the choices combined to together,\ndictate the complete life ahead of you (paraphrasing Renaissance Man) and your content of character (MLK Jr.)\nAuthenticity,\nwill always add.\nInauthenticity,\nwill always replace some important part of you with blank space.\nAnd compromise, compromise never adds anything to goodness,\nit can only take from goodness and empower some damn evil (paraphrasing Ayn Rand's John Galt speech).\n\nMay all your knowledge shine with the brightest of lights,\nmay it all add to fuel unseen ideas.\nCome your middle age,\nmay an urge to write your books become unstoppable.\nAnd may all your hard earned wisdom add to make your aches count for even more,\nby helping countless others to start, where you left off.",

get your feet used to the Running Man,</p>\n  <p>take a look at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc6B14K1SZ8\">the move set tutorial by Anastasiia Kirilik</a> on YouTube for more moves.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Start with slow music <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ItHLz5WEA&amp;list=PLa2rOLrAc0awWA1Y3xN5uxqm31ui-49_4\">Alan Walker</a> works great,</p>\n  <p>please remember to use music during your practice, synchronize your running man with the beat, and the switch of the feet to the sound between the beat.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You need that beat,</p>\n  <p>and it has to be a slow song that moves your feet.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your feet learn dance the same way,</p>\n  <p>that your brain learns a poem.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just trying to dance,</p>\n  <p>will get your feet prepared.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And you will make,</p>\n  <p>fewer mistakes as you go.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Lastly, as you speed your music up, your shuffle may transform to a much more optimized and lower version,</p>\n  <p>and that is OK, it is jut not possible to do the full Running Man to very fast music, so your feet will make a smaller motion to hit every beat.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Take good care of your play list,</p>\n  <p>it only takes a few months to run out of all the songs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A new and fresh song,</p>\n  <p>will give you energy, your body will move much faster.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But as you get use to it,</p>\n  <p>that energy will fade, so you have to keep searching for new

  "text": "Robert Ardrey once said,\nthat we will be known among the stars by our poems.\nHe meant poems in the broad sense of the word,\nsurely.\nEven more powerful than a poem,\nis a dance.\n\nDance was invented to keep warriors, fit,\nit was invented for battle.\nBut since,\nHumanity has grown to make it nobler.\nTo make it beautiful,\nour dancing will be seen as one of our most magnificent ideas.\n\nI grew up with Fred Astaire[1],\nand Mr. Bean[2].\nI think Mr Beanbastic[3],\nis a real gem.\nOf course, so is the choreography of the Napoleon Dynamite Dance[4],\nwhich is used in joyful tutorials[5], and epic dares[6].\n\nIt did not occur to me to start dancing until I saw Big Daddy Fat[7] do it,\nit is a variation on the Melbourne Shuffle[8] which has undergone great evolution.\nWe all remember Flashdance[9] and Dirty Dancing[10],\nbut very few of us realize that dancing is a very important part of growing up.\n\nIf you are not yet in shape, that is OK,\nbegin with a Rocky IV[11] style exercise, where you avoid machines and try to work and flex your full body.\nJog, shuffle your feet to lifting dumbbells, try swimming, skating, bicycling,\nor hitting the trails and camping through beautiful adventures.\nIf you are large, that means you already have the muscles,\nyou just need a cute little diet.\nSwitch your meals to be dominated by shredded lettuce,\nand only flavored by your favorite foods, you can even stick a little bit of a hamburger, or cut up a hot-dog into your lettuce creation.\nLettuce is less of a health food, and more of a filler material,\nit will lower the caloric density of your daily food intake, and help your muscles come through for you.\n\nDancing,\nwill help you set aside all that is not important.\nAnd dancing will make you healthy,\nflexible, strong, and even grow your muscles more, so as long as you dance fast, honest, and every day.\n\nThe dance I recommend is the Shuffle Dance,\nit is a combination of the Running Man[12] and the T-Step[13].\nOnce you get your feet used to the Running Man,\ntake a look at the move set tutorial by Anastasiia Kirilik[14] on YouTube for more moves.\n\nStart with slow music Alan Walker[15] works great,\nplease remember to use music during your practice, synchronize your running man with the beat, and the switch of the feet to the sound between the beat.\nYou need that beat,\nand it has to be a slow song that moves your feet.\n\nYour feet learn dance the same way,\nthat your brain learns a poem.\nJust trying to dance,\nwill get your feet prepared.\nAnd you will make,\nfewer mistakes as you go.\n\nLastly, as you speed your music up, your shuffle may transform to a much more optimized and lower version,\nand that is OK, it is jut not possible to do the full Running Man to very fast music, so your feet will make a smaller motion to hit every beat.\nTake good care of your play list,\nit only takes a few months to run out of all the songs.\nA new and fresh song,\nwill give you energy, your body will move much faster.\nBut as you get use to it,\nthat energy will fade, so you have to keep searching for new songs, every week and sometimes every day.\n\nSo as long as you dance,\nyou will become better at it.\nDon't be scared,\nand don't be too shy.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AQjcmzvx8\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT_IiHsZtWg\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0tm7IjqGfk\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELBy5stH3b8\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5WojwivFSM\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RMteAzkORE\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB8nImV9Kp4\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oTUupME0-M&t=15s\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miax0Jpe5mA\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ2lUog6jZ0\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_9FyTiq3SA\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZvD9p8Btdk\n[13]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuzTnjTGW44\n[14]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc6B14K1SZ8\n[15]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60ItHLz5WEA&list=PLa2rOLrAc0awWA1Y3xN5uxqm31ui-49_4",

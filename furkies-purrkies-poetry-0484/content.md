We are not machines, we are meant to flow,
we are not meant to pick careers for show.

We are not workers, we are thinkers and creators,
we are not meant to spend our lives as system administrators.

We cannot just follow rules,
we are not mere tools.

We have to fix rules, and think of the future of the world,
we have to leave behind all the broken politics of old.

And we are not echoes, we must accept nothing for granted,
because the old rules somehow always end up being slanted.

To be force fed disconnected facts, fat fact after a fat fact,
means you are being attacked.

You can't triumph by pretending-to-learn-and-graduating-top-of-class,
that only means the teacher is an ass.

Find you books, treasure them and reread them to no end,
there is nothing to be gained when teachers trick us to pretend.

We have to add little sticks to little sticks,
before we light the fire of fixing politics.

Our true strength is not just in numbers but in wisdom as well,
we must each get a real education before we ring that bell.

We are nature, like a river we must flow,
and we each need sunshine, winds, and rain, and snow.

Lessons cannot be taught, a mind must be free,
lessons must extend like leaves on a tree.

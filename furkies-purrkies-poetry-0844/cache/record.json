they don't always need the Teenager explanation.\nAmong well educated professionals it is assumed,\nthat there is a certain level of knowledge that does not require all the explanations.\nSee that is the definition of real school,\nthat assumption is not made among the students, and every subject here, will have a clear and easy to understand on ramp.\nIn schools of today, teachers in their incompetence and insanity invented the crazy fantasy of pre-requsite knowledge,\nensuring that if you miss something in the beginning of High School, you will be forced to merely memorize content as you go on, and they will pass you along to make it look legit.\nAfter all, they are trying to do as little as possible,\nwhile giving a convincing impression of education and educational materials.\n\nYou kind of create a real school, when you go on the internet,\nand begin researching something for real, and actually assemble that on ramp.\nBut you see, that is the job of school,\nthat is how they should be teaching you, by helping you build up real knowledge, that is relevant to you.\nYou can see how fitting it is to call school fake,\nwhen you have to go home and lean on your own, and then use some of that to pass their warped testing.\nThe cute tests with trick questions, will make yo smile,\nbut they are pretty bad for you, knowledge is not a game...\nWhere a bunch of morons come together to throw you off,\nwith moronic questions.\nKnowledge is delicate, you don not want to be taking tests that try to mix things up,\nbecause they will cause harm to delicate distinctions that you are slowly building up.\nI compare finals with trick questions, to a teacher showing up at your home,\nand quietly reliving himself in the middle of your living room, with a great big smile of approval, or whatever.\n\nI just want to underline that the sequence in which you learn is very important,\nit is critical.\nYou can only learn based on what you know, it is no good for you to learn about memory collection and malloc,\nwhen you have determined that you are most powerful when learning high level programming languages that help you to program Visual Programming Languages.\nOnly you can make the determination of where you are going,\nand that determination will shift as you learn more and more.\nReal education will alter your decision making, will enhance your personality, refine the choices you are making,\nand take you to a future that you understand, that makes you feel whole.\nThis is not to say, that you will end up as a Ballerina, instead of a Doctor or Attorney,\nit means you will become an expert of wherever you go.\nIf you do end up a Ballerina, they you will also run a successful school for athletes,\nand you will ensure their safety and security, intellectual independence, and greatness.\nAn expert is a person with integrated knowledge,\nthat spans the entire area they are working in, Human Condition first.\n\nAs we transition to even the darker side and close,\nI want to mention to you a quote by Plutarch\n\"The mind is not a vessel to be filled,\nbut a fire to be kindled.\"\nYou can see how this makes a distinction between memorizing,\nand learning, poetically speaking, becoming ravenous for knowledge.\nAny attempt at tricking students into memorization, including the notion of pre-requisite classes,\nand especially standardized education, and of course, punishment with grades, and threats of being branded as mentally-late by holding them back - makes for a fake school.\nThis has been well defined, it has been considered,\nif you are tricked into memorization, your school is fake, and your education will later turn out to be ineffective.\n\nCollapsing education on purpose,\nhas been used to instill violence, create obedient slaves or soldiers, and cause regime change.\nSchools in well developed nations, as bad as they are,\nthey are not yet evil.\nBut creepy schools do exist[3], and they betray students,\nfor money, for power, out of sickens, out of evil.\nHere the teachers say, that they don't know if what they are teaching is real,\nbut if their imaginary creatures of might and glory wanted to do something that looks unreal, they could totally do it.\nThe do not accept responsibility for the things they teach, because they know they are not real,\nand when pressed they will hide themselves behind a major culture, and say, and say X billion people cant be wrong.\nThey do not aim to win the arguments,\nthey aim to avoid them.\n\nHere in closing I wanted to explain the opening line of \"How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real\",\nthis was uttered by a young person after it was explained to them that our views of the world are influenced by our upbringing.\nHe looked in a mirror, and said, if my eyes are lying to me,\nthen how can my reflection truly show who I am.\n\nThe only way to become the person that the adult you should be,\nis by means of real education.\nReal and meaningful life changing education,\nwill refine your decision making, to truly make it your own.\nSo that your older self will be proud of and at peace with,\nthat you in your youth and middle age have made.\n\nThis closing point shows you how critical real education is,\nand more importantly, it shows how important it is that you get a real education as soon as possible.\nThe delaying of the onset of your wisdom by a moderate teacher in a well developed nation,\nis as evil, as purposefully warping the minds of trusting students in order to cause regime change or raise a generation of slaves or soldiers.\n\nGet your mittens at narrated books that are held in high esteem by all the worlds intellectuals,\ndon't pay too much attention to their flaws yet, it is a wonder that they exist at all.\nAllow yourself to grow up surrounded by wisdom,\ninherit lifetimes of knowledge from powerful biographies and non fiction.\nOnce your eyes begin seeing through the wisdom that does your elder self justice,\nyou will then, make the mirrors real.\nAnd what is more, you will then be able to explain,\nhow the letters on your shirt are mirrored and go right to left, but, BUT, BuUuT, your left hand is still your left hand in your mirror image.\nHow can mirrors be real if they only reverse text,\nand NOT your left and right hand side?\nGrrrrrr....\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQPEZdBTOeE\n[3]: https://youtu.be/IzZh2wstj88?t=3399",

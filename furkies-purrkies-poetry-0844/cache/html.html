  <p>They are teachers, to make money,<br>to put food on the table.</p>

  <p>A lot of politicians feel,<br>that they shouldn't worry about the things that you can do on your own.</p>
  <p>When you are in High School,<br>you'll get a bad education, but as you grow you will fix that by reading real books.</p>
  <p>A lot of them kind of feel, that it is good enough,<br>to keep you out of prison, give you text books, and work...</p>
  <p>So that they can be the leaders,<br>and you can be the stuffing, the machinery, the content, the people.</p>
  <p>This only sounds reasonable, because while they lead, and you get a crappy education,<br>the world's dictators use drug trade to stay in power, and fund nuclear weapons research, while religious extremists do all the rest.</p>

  <p>Let me define some terms for you, fake education, is a name I came up with,<br>in response to people using the words "Fake News" - it is my way of calling out the liars.</p>
  <p>The actual term that I am thinking of, is:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">ineffective education</a>.</p>
  <p>That is when professionals look at the long therm outcome of an educational system,<br>and decide that it did not have the expected result.</p>
  <p>Because no one is fixing anything,<br>I just call it fake.</p>
  <p>I suspect that schools cause damage to our natural curiosity about complex things,<br>that without grades and stress of fake school, punishment, poverty, and the threat of not getting a job...</p>
  <p>When you first truly notice stars, you'll be guided to use the family telescope,<br>and slowly explained how Newton arrived at the laws, with little mechanical machines, and gradual changes to mathematical figures.</p>
  <p>That with Love and Respect you would be introduced to computation on a computer where you can witness the results,<br>instead of paper, where the results look great when the teacher secretly forces everyone to memorize the formulas so that they can put food on their table.</p>

  <p>A young person still need the framework,<br>not the content and direction, but the structure and availability of information with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQPEZdBTOeE">easy on-ramp</a> access.</p>
  <p>Easy on-ramp access, means that there is an interface for a student,<br>because normally scientists don't need that easy interface, though they always learn at every turn - they don't always need the Teenager explanation.</p>
  <p>Among well educated professionals it is assumed,<br>that there is a certain level of knowledge that does not require all the explanations.</p>
  <p>See that is the definition of real school,<br>that assumption is not made among the students, and every subject here, will have a clear and easy to understand on ramp.</p>
  <p>In schools of today, teachers in their incompetence and insanity invented the crazy fantasy of pre-requsite knowledge,<br>ensuring that if you miss something in the beginning of High School, you will be forced to merely memorize content as you go on, and they will pass you along to make it look legit.</p>
  <p>After all, they are trying to do as little as possible,<br>while giving a convincing impression of education and educational materials.</p>

  <p>You kind of create a real school, when you go on the internet,<br>and begin researching something for real, and actually assemble that on ramp.</p>
  <p>But you see, that is the job of school,<br>that is how they should be teaching you, by helping you build up real knowledge, that is relevant to you.</p>
  <p>You can see how fitting it is to call school fake,<br>when you have to go home and lean on your own, and then use some of that to pass their warped testing.</p>
  <p>The cute tests with trick questions, will make yo smile,<br>but they are pretty bad for you, knowledge is not a game...</p>
  <p>Where a bunch of morons come together to throw you off,<br>with moronic questions.</p>
  <p>Knowledge is delicate, you don not want to be taking tests that try to mix things up,<br>because they will cause harm to delicate distinctions that you are slowly building up.</p>
  <p>I compare finals with trick questions, to a teacher showing up at your home,<br>and quietly reliving himself in the middle of your living room, with a great big smile of approval, or whatever.</p>

  <p>I just want to underline that the sequence in which you learn is very important,<br>it is critical.</p>
  <p>You can only learn based on what you know, it is no good for you to learn about memory collection and malloc,<br>when you have determined that you are most powerful when learning high level programming languages that help you to program Visual Programming Languages.</p>
  <p>Only you can make the determination of where you are going,<br>and that determination will shift as you learn more and more.</p>
  <p>Real education will alter your decision making, will enhance your personality, refine the choices you are making,<br>and take you to a future that you understand, that makes you feel whole.</p>
  <p>This is not to say, that you will end up as a Ballerina, instead of a Doctor or Attorney,<br>it means you will become an expert of wherever you go.</p>
  <p>If you do end up a Ballerina, they you will also run a successful school for athletes,<br>and you will ensure their safety and security, intellectual independence, and greatness.</p>
  <p>An expert is a person with integrated knowledge,<br>that spans the entire area they are working in, Human Condition first.</p>

  <p>As we transition to even the darker side and close,<br>I want to mention to you a quote by Plutarch</p>
  <p>"The mind is not a vessel to be filled,<br>but a fire to be kindled."</p>
  <p>You can see how this makes a distinction between memorizing,<br>and learning, poetically speaking, becoming ravenous for knowledge.</p>
  <p>Any attempt at tricking students into memorization, including the notion of pre-requisite classes,<br>and especially standardized education, and of course, punishment with grades, and threats of being branded as mentally-late by holding them back - makes for a fake school.</p>
  <p>This has been well defined, it has been considered,<br>if you are tricked into memorization, your school is fake, and your education will later turn out to be ineffective.</p>

Greatness is not a question of having it or not,
it is whether or not you use it a little or a lot.

We will each be asked to become Wise and Great,
to save the world from mediocrity and hate.

All battles for goodness are already won,
and before you know it, your great task will be done.

But first, we need to learn to reject the status quo,
set off on a quest for wisdom, and enlightenment, and go.

You never really fight in a good war,
the enemy in their madness never makes it out the door.

But Greatness will call to you non the less,
it will ask you to speak about Wisdom, Love, Growing Up, and Kindness.

You see many Great Beings smile when facing wrath,
that powerful joy comes from the certainty of walking the right path.

Those who walk the wrong path, age quickly and fade,
and history books will soon-enough reveal their charade.

The Noble Greatness within us all is forged to last,
and the opportunities ahead are as beautiful as vast.

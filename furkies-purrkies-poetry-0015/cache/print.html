  <div class="paragraph">People grow old only by deserting their ideals, MacArthur had written.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up interest wrinkles the soul.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">You are as young as your faith, as old as your doubt; as young as your self-confidence, as old as your fear; as young as your hope as old as your despair.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">In the central place of every heart there is a recording chamber.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">So long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer and courage, so long are you young.</div>
  <div class="paragraph">When your heart is covered with the snows of pessimism and the ice of cynicism, then, and then only, are you grown old.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">And then, indeed as the ballad says, you just fade away.</div>

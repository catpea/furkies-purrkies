We must not forget about broken schools we've been to,
we did not yet graduate.

The school was fake,
and so was the graduation.

---

Humanity is being held back,
by children raised in a different time.

And taught in schools so broken,
as to be effective fake.

And it will be the ideas that are dear to you,
that __you__ will strongly stand for in the future.

---

This is why you need knowledge and wisdom and greatness,
you must not continue repeating mistakes that have been made before.

---

Our inability to notice slow complex changes,
may make it seem like things are just fine.

But, Poverty, Mass Incarceration, Fake Education, end of Privacy,
is a call for urgent repairs.

---

The systems we have build are like computer programs,
and like computer programs they can become spaghetti code.

These programs must not interfere with Humanity's Progress,
as that can only needlessly prolong suffering.

If all we do is wait for politicians to pass,
their lesser version will step in, and do much the same or worse.

We have to build free and open schools,
independent of the nations, that they serve in.

School cannot charge money,
nor does it require teachers when programmed correctly.

---

We get easily confused,
from fake education, mostly.

We don't need Student Loan forgiveness,
all students, including those who have long graduated, __need a Refund__.

And they still need,
a real education.

And not just an education aimed at making money,
but an education that will help them become Great Beings.

And guard our achievement,
and the pace of our progress.

---

Relying on poverty to motivate the world,
will only lead to desperation, and resulting __devastation__.

---

But, like a computer programs,
there are many sides to a thing.

A school need not come,
from the State, or Government or Nation.

In deed it is best build by the students,
that know what needs to be repaired.

---

And and all things,
have a root somewhere.

The thing that holds the world back,
has its root in fake education.

Nobody wants to teach for real,
and certainty nobody wants to teach for free.

---

Seeing that children do not complain about fake education,
because they don't know what real education actually looks like.

Is a call to action,
not a call to resignation.

---

Let us take,
to another side of education.

Let us, the former students,
build a school that would have worked for us when we were younger.

Let us not abandon the children of today,
to the education that we know is ineffective.

---

The idea of leaving it up to a teacher,
to regurgitate some preset problem-and-solution.

That fits a standardized curriculum,
so lacking in structure.

That is teems to have been made,
for the purpose of rote memorization.

Is a bad idea,
as it only lines the pockets of the aging men who sold the world.

---

A school is a,
library of all our inventions.

Along with multiple, well defined, and named,
ways of revealing their underlying mechanics.

A catalog,
of ways of explaining things.

Be it with use of analogies, stories, info-graphics,
interactive simulations and laboratories or video an animation.

It does not just teach Arithmetic or Calculus,
but the underlying mechanics necessary to make best use of it throughout one's life.

That is,
what a school is for.

---

This is not a project that any one nation can create,
it will take all of us.

And this is not a school that can be governed,
it must only be a system of paths for use.

Let all the other paths,
lay exposed for all to see.

The paths taken are up to the students,
and the paths more traveled by will be most beautiful.

And paths must lead away from poverty and towards independence,
enabling students with Knowledge that begets Wisdom, which in turn leads to Greatness.

Greatness is what paves the road to Wold Peace and Stability, and its flourishing,
a blooming world free from poverty and ineffective leaders.

A healthy and great world,
worthy of all the future generations to whom it belongs the most.

  <p>The systems we have build are like computer programs,<br>and like computer programs they can become spaghetti code.</p>
  <p>These programs must not interfere with Humanity's Progress,<br>as that can only needlessly prolong suffering.</p>
  <p>If all we do is wait for politicians to pass,<br>their lesser version will step in, and do much the same or worse.</p>
  <p>We have to build free and open schools,<br>independent of the nations, that they serve in.</p>

  <p>The paths taken are up to the students,<br>and the paths more traveled by will be most beautiful.</p>
  <p>And paths must lead away from poverty and towards independence,<br>enabling students with Knowledge that begets Wisdom, which in turn leads to Greatness.</p>
  <p>Greatness is what paves the road to Wold Peace and Stability, and its flourishing,<br>a blooming world free from poverty and ineffective leaders.</p>

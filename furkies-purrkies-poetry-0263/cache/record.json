  "text": "It is quite a quirk we have,\nthat we believe whatever we are born into.\n\nIt is such a terrible disadvantage,\nand nobody, makes it known to us.\n\nThe study of Cognitive Biases,\nshould be first and foremost.\n\nI wish teachers would speak out more often,\ninstead they are just pushing everyone through.\n\nFor one they get to keep their jobs,\nand two, it is not their job to fix education.\n\nIt takes so little, to start learning on your own,\nand it makes such an enormous difference.\n\nLife becomes so long, and so cheerful,\nand you can feel your self growing up.\n\nBook by book, curiosity by curiosity,\nall the dots connect.\n\nAnd they will only connect,\nif you are learning what you like or love.\n\nIf someone is making those selections for you,\nthen it is all just going to be disconnected noise.\n\nAt a young age it is all to easy to say,\neducation is not for me.\n\nSimilar thing happens in Academic Philosophy,\npeople simply say \"Philosophy is useless for life\".\n\n\"Academic Philosophy,\nhas no relevance.\"\n\nPhilo-sophia means Love of Wisdom,\nbut when it it taken into Academia...\n\nWhen it is divided into subjects,\nit loses everything, it becomes synthetic, and useless.\n\nThat's how you should view Education divided into subjects,\nsynthetic, and useless.\n\nReal education is the thing that Great Beings granted themselves,\nbefore standardized schooling became mandatory and cut up.\n\nBuild your own school,\nbook by book, adventure by adventure, curiosity by curiosity.\n\nYou have a powerful mind,\nthe constellation of stars within, is perfectly unique.\n\nYou are irreplaceable,\nin every way.\n\nDon't trust anybody to teach you anything,\njust make your way towards books that move you.\n\nIn this modern age,\nbooks are read to you, by professional narrators.\n\nSo as long as you slow down to give them a chance, you can learn,\nfrom the Proudest Works, of the Greatest Minds, in the best of ways.\n\nTeachers only care about the moment they are in,\nbut your life, will be long.\n\nYour life will carry on,\nlong after school.\n\nYou need real education,\none that leads to real wisdom.\n\nWe can't go through life,\nfilled with disconnected knowledge that can't connect.\n\nWe need a self-reinforcing, integrated library,\nof all the modern works.\n\nYou can only get that from modern non-fiction, or popular science books,\nand especially when authors reference or thank each other.\n\nA popular science book is a story about the science,\nabout the things that made it come into being.\n\nFacts are the least that thy take away from it,\nit is the stories of adventure, and modes of thinking that matter most.\n\nOur search for wisdom must come first,\nor we won't be able to tell real from fake.\n\nWisdom is fundamental to our decision making,\nclarity of vision, is too important to trust others with.\n\nIt shouldn't matter where to to whom we are born,\nthere is just one reality.",

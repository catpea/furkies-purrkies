  <p>Lack of real education,<br>has been behind wrong doing in every nation.</p>
  <p>Education is our most important invention,<br>our only means of crime and war prevention.</p>
  <p>Let us set students free,<br>form all the worldâ€™s poverty.</p>
  <p>Let us end poverty and all the charades,<br>and force school to pay, pay, for grades.</p>

  <p>We must all aim to agree,<br>that real education makes the world open and free.</p>
  <p>Let us eliminate poverty by paying for education,<br>let us build a new world, by uniting every nation.</p>
  <p>Let us call it Earth and live without war,<br>instead of fighting ... let us learn, more.</p>
  <p>--</p>
  <p>Stop letting liars tell you that "peace cannot be",<br>because they are deaf, dumb and cannot see.</p>
  <p>They will lie to keep the world chained,<br>so as long as there is still a living soul to be drained.</p>
  <p>Liars are broken and cannot think for real,<br>some turn off their hearts and cannot even feel.</p>

  <p>Above all, and it goes without a say,<br>that we must learn for real, each and every day.</p>
  <p>And we must remember that schools may never work,<br>and that we all have an odd quirk.</p>
  <p>We are stuck under this shadow,<br>only making decisions based on what we know.</p>
  <p>So we have to lean as much as we can,<br>to dream up the wisest plan.</p>
  <p>Not just for learning more,<br>though that should be at its core.</p>
  <p>But for helping the world grow too,<br>as it too needs a greater view.</p>

  <p>We must not tolerate broken schools,<br>anymore than we use broken tools.</p>
  <p>Lack of real education is madness,<br>and it can only take us towards great sadness.</p>
  <p>Learning for real,<br>is a huge deal.</p>
  <p>It is such a huge deal,<br>that is does not even matter if schools are real.</p>
  <p>We should learn on our own anyway,<br>that is the most trustworthy way.</p>

  <p>Whatever lies stand in your way,<br>you have to kick them away.</p>
  <p>Because we need real knowledge to be strong,<br>it is broken school is where things go wrong.</p>
  <p>That quirk of ours does not let us see,<br>how fake schools force us all to disagree.</p>

  <p>Parents, do not trust a broken school,<br>students learning on their own, should be the rule.</p>
  <p>It is even worse in broken nations where corrupt schools,<br>are little more than propaganda tools.</p>
  <p>Make no mistake schools should pay for grades,<br>rather than send children into war or military parades.</p>
  <p>Early life is meant to be beautiful,<br>not turn a trusting student into a tool.</p>

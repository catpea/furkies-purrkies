  <p>Your first and foremost obstacle is the liar,<br>also sometimes called an evil person, or hacker in the vile sense.</p>
  <p>Above all know that the lairs do what they do,<br>out of illness; their minds have long unraveled.</p>
  <p>We may speak of how they want treasures,<br>or how they wish to be remembered by history.</p>
  <p>But that is just our projection to account for their evil,<br>their evil has no logic.</p>
  <p>No more logic,<br>than a hunger for more pleasure they get from more evil and corruption.</p>
  <p>In their minds they believe they are multiplying their power,<br>by not playing by the rules - but they are just hollow.</p>
  <p>They hate life, they don't understand it,<br>and stepping on other peoples heads gives them something to do.</p>

  <p>While we build cities,<br>the liars drive corruption into them.</p>
  <p>And when we corner the rats,<br>they will tear the cities down entirely.</p>
  <p>This is a story as old,<br>as humanity it self.</p>
  <p>And even this story,<br>is never told without lies.</p>
  <p>Each retelling,<br>has another liar slithering in between the pages of history.</p>

  <p>Liars use multiple steps,<br>which blur and hide their true intentions.</p>
  <p>And sometimes bury their evil,<br>in plausible deniability.</p>
  <p>They can also spreed their misery organically,<br>like a slime, growing where it is merely most advantageous.</p>
  <p>They rob banks, or pinch pennies of the poor,<br>simple because that is where the money is.</p>

  <p>For example any and all attacks at the modern world, human rights, or the undoing of good ideas,<br>is simply is a cheap voter grab.</p>
  <p>Liars are saying things that are opposite to progress,<br>to gather up uneducated voters on the opposing side - that is all.</p>
  <p>They are tapping into the opposition,<br>and merely using it to slither into politics.</p>
  <p>This it will be obscured,<br>by them taking advantage of random things along the way.</p>
  <p>Randomly emerging communities,<br>randomly occurring events during their manipulations.</p>

  <p>That liars are successful,<br>depends on mislead or uneducated voters.</p>
  <p>And uneducated voters,<br>are a product of ineffective schools.</p>
  <p>Fantasy education, or any kind of in-authenticity,<br>is the fuel of a liar.</p>
  <p>It fuels those who seek to be elected,<br>and those who prefer to slither in darkness.</p>

  <p>Historically where we aimed for Love and Peace,<br>liars, simply manufactured, enemies and war.</p>
  <p>The lairs attack our foundation,<br>the places that we have long risen above.</p>

  <p>Those who rise,<br>rise to bring joy to the world.</p>
  <p>Nobody is born a liar,<br>it is a state that a desperate or broken person is pressed into.</p>
  <p>Liars should be prevented from existing,<br>in the first place.</p>
  <p>That is why, we need to learn for real,<br>why we must aim for Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness for all.</p>
  <p>Well educated voters and politicians,<br>will swiftly put an end to poverty, and war.</p>
  <p>Eventually in your collective wisdom,<br>you will create a world of politics that cleverly denies, the liar or dictator any and all entry.</p>

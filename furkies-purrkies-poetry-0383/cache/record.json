href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS6EEUVZGLE\">your own take on BDD</a> so that you can focus on sketching and let others code it for you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS6EEUVZGLE\">Behavior Driven Development</a> or BDD for short, describes computer programs in plain English,</p>\n  <p>leaving it to programmers to fill in what is broken.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>BDD is very simple,</p>\n  <p>but I am yet to find a simple explanation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>BDD is about writing stories about your program,</p>\n  <p>these stories describe what is going on, what is about to happen, and what should be the result.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If what happened does not create the expected result,</p>\n  <p>then you will know that part of your program is either broken or unfinished.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us begin programming a simple game,</p>\n  <p>where squirrel eat peanuts.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>First we describe the world,</p>\n  <p>There is a peanut on the ground, a tree, a squirrel in the tree, and she is really hungry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the world of computers you have four <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFmuCDHHpwk\">objects</a> here:</p>\n  <p>peanut, ground, tree, squirrel.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The squirrel has a property of hungry,</p>\n  <p>since our story seems to hint on a squirrel that can be a bit hungry, rather than a true or false, lets make the property a percent.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Since we don&apos;t want to do any special math,</p>\n  <p>we will express percent as a fraction between 0 and 1, where zero is not quite hungry but may eat something, and one is really hungry and about to pass out for a little while.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let&apos;s tidy up the place a bit, and create a world for our objects,</p>\n  <p>so now world contains ground, ground contains peanut, and tree, and tree contains squirrel.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In computer world there are primitive variables like number or fraction,</p>\n  <p>but also complex variables like objects that can contain a primitive like hungry, or list like inventory.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Though it is tempting to think of everything as a variable,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t do that too much.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>An object is a perfect and precise thing,</p>\n  <p>though it can contain a list, don&apos;t think of it as a singe unit, where you set it and forget it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In the world of databases, in order to allow billions of records,</p>\n  <p>you really want to keep objects and lists separate, and load their data separately and treat each with respect.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The kind of thinking where you say I created a squirrel with a number expressing hunger and an inventory list that may hold a peanut is too simple,</p>\n  <p>and won&apos;t translate well to databases.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just think of it as an object with properties, that also has a list called inventory,</p>\n  <p>not object with properties where one of the properties is a list, be respectful of data structures, keep them loosely coupled.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If everything becomes too tightly bound,</p>\n  <p>you will cut yourself off from easily speaking to simple databases.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now that we have a world,</p>\n  <p>we know that the squirrel isn&apos;t doing anything.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is just really hungry,</p>\n  <p>it is like world without anything going on.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So now we have to describe some action,</p>\n  <p>something that will cause a change.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If we were just writing a normal story in an essay,</p>\n  <p>we would first describe the world, and then what was going on in that world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Same thing is happening here, but the two things STORY CONTEXT, and ACTION EVENT, must be kept separate,</p>\n  <p>and we have to be serious about this, because somewhere down the road we may add a new ACTION EVENT, that reuses the story so that we can test something else.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The STORY CONTEXT will stay the same,</p>\n  <p>we will only add an ACTION EVENT, or a hundred of them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If we keep out BDD nice and tidy,</p>\n  <p>if we are keeping context separate from action, it will all be very easy to understand.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So in this ACTION EVENT,</p>\n  <p>we&apos;ll just make the squirrel simply notice the peanut, jump down from the tree, and put it in her little cheek.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And that is it, but this is a lot,</p>\n  <p>because now, the tree no longer contains the squirrel, the ground no longer contains the peanut, all kinds of things have changed.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So now we add the OUTCOME TEST,</p>\n  <p>this is what BDD, and all this crazy story writing is about.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We now describe the state of the things in the stuck-a-penut-in-her-cheek world,</p>\n  <p>and if the program does not behave the same way as the outcome, we know that it is unfinished or broken, and can send a programmer in here.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Our test of outcome must at least describe that the peanut and squirrel have moved,</p>\n  <p>that the squirrel is on the ground and the peanut, well, is in the squirrel, we don&apos;t care if cheeks or in her stomach, we don&apos;t care if the peanut is whole, or crunched up.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The little details are unimportant to our game,</p>\n  <p>nobody cares to test these details, nobody cares to pay programmers to test them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Think of it as doing scientific research, and trying to figure out what the structure of DNA is,</p>\n  <p>if you come across another molecule, one that is not the point of your research, you just don&apos;t pay attention to it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To give some structure to what is basically text,</p>\n  <p>BDD developers came up with a language that sort of everyone agrees on using.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just to be precise of what is what, the story description starts with the word given, the action description starts with the word when, and the outcome description starts with the word then.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So, given, when, then,</p>\n  <p>given this type of a world, when this thing happens, then this stuff should be true.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When other programmers read your BDD they will be familiar with the Given, When, Then method of story writing,</p>\n  <p>and will continue playing along so that now you are going to be able to read any new tests they add.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us describe our squirrel story in BDD syntax now,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Given the world has squirrel in a tree</p>\n  <p>And the squirrel is really hungry</p>\n  <p>And there is a peanut on the ground</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When the squirrel notices the peanut</p>\n  <p>Then the squirrel leaves the tree</p>\n  <p>And gets on the ground</p>\n  <p>And puts the peanut in her cheek</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When the squirrel eats the peanut,</p>\n  <p>Then the squirrel is no longer really hungry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Note how I added a second when, where the squirrel actually ate the peanut,</p>\n  <p>I actually reused the STORY CONTEXT, I just added a new action event.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Also note that I chain things with the word &quot;And&quot; as in:</p>\n  <p>the squirrel leaves the tree, AND gets on the ground, AND puts the peanut in her cheek.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This syntax exists for the purpose for keeping BDD programs simple,</p>\n  <p>dealing with English text is a difficult problem, but if we just patiently take that one extra step and use Given, When, Then, and And, it makes a world of difference.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I don&apos;t want to tell you this as not to mix anything up,</p>\n  <p>but personally, I kind of think of this syntax as a subset of English, one that is just used amongs us the programmers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Yes,</p>\n  <p>you are a programmer now.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And now you may wish to ask,</p>\n  <p>well how the heck do I run this thing?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Is there a program?</p>\n  <p>and how will it know about squirrels?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You will have to write two programs to run the squirrel world,</p>\n  <p>first is the game that we are describing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And the second, is a testing framework</p>\n  <p>where we will import the game, and pretend we are a player, while running the tests.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The types of games that deal with Squirrels, or Virtual Worlds for that matter, are called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqC66POqhY4\">MUD</a>s,</p>\n  <p>or Multi User Dungeons, or Multi User Dungeons Object Oriented.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Writing a MUD is a fun way to learn programming,</p>\n  <p>you can probably do it in 20 lines of code, but you may actually fall in love with programming mini worlds, and grow them to a million lines of code.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you are not into computer games,</p>\n  <p>then you should know a mud can be used to generate poetry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example imagine, that the world exists in a poet&apos;s mind,</p>\n  <p>and when the game is executed for real, the squirrel will examine its environment, while muttering something about leaves and trees,</p>\n  <p>and then rhyme something poetic about peanuts, hunger, and how they are crunchy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here is one such program called <a href=\"https://github.com/fantasyui-com/limerick\">limerick</a>,</p>\n  <p>it took no effort to create it, it was just a lot of fun.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Once you write a tiny MUD,</p>\n  <p>then you create a program called test, and import your world as a module.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And begin executing the BDD tests,</p>\n  <p>you load up the story file we created, and just parse beginning with the first line:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>&quot;Given the world has squirrel in a tree.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You instruct your MUD to create a new world,</p>\n  <p>create a tree object,</p>\n  <p>create a squirrel object,</p>\n  <p>and then add the squirrel to tree.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now you just move onto the second line,</p>\n  <p>&quot;And the squirrel is really hungry&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>so you set the hunger value of the squirrel object to 1,</p>\n  <p>or maybe energy value of squirrel to 0.01, meaning it is running out of energy and only food can restore it in context of this game.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And continue on,</p>\n  <p>when you develop your MUD you define plants, trees, animals, so it is really easy to just get them in here and set them up for the purpose of this test.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The way you parse a line of text, that you loaded from a file is kind of unusual in BDD systems,</p>\n  <p>what you want to do is create a tiny program precisely named after the line, so if the line changes the program becomes dissociated, it goes away.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The easiest way to associate a program with &quot;Given the world has squirrel in a tree.&quot;,</p>\n  <p>is just creating a function or a file named after the slugged version of this sentence, to make a slug, is to lowercase everything and replace spaced with hyphens, simplify it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Another way, is to use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhzKDrUiJVk\">regular expressions</a>, JavaScript has named capture groups now,</p>\n  <p>so regular expressions are much easier.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here is an <a href=\"https://github.com/hubotio/hubot-rules/blob/fba046d31771b1a3b296ac5e653e8c616bc19230/src/rules.js#L26\">example of a regular expression in the wild</a>,</p>\n  <p>parsing the sentence and variations of &quot;What are the three laws?&quot;, see line number 26.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As you are learning programming,</p>\n  <p>do what feels right for you.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Personally, this would be where I&apos;d take a moment to grok regex once and for all,</p>\n  <p>regular expressions are used on the Unix command line as well, so you&apos;d be learning something that is useful in other places.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://regexr.com/\">Regular Expression Visualization Tools</a>,</p>\n  <p>so you can see how the matches are occurring.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you don&apos;t feel right about learning regex,</p>\n  <p>don&apos;t do it, it is an acquired taste.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I think a lot of people just google <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=regex+how+do+I+match+email+address\">regex how do I match email address</a>,</p>\n  <p>and just go with the results until they start seeing patterns and finally take the plunge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In terms of how frequently you use that kind of thing in programming,</p>\n  <p>not often, instead of matching something to recognize it, you really want to specify a type for the thing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://github.com/catpea/warrior/blob/eec3d4779718a01db4c854f7f61bde6479ce0183/db/the-reverse-engineer/index.yaml#L5\">Take a look at how I create pages of YouTube videos</a>,</p>\n  <p>instead of searching for something that looks like a youtube id, which is costly in terms of CPU cycles...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I state &quot;type: youtube&quot;,</p>\n  <p>and there is no question that the id that follows is a video id.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But when you are dealing with something like parsing English in a BDD line of text,</p>\n  <p>then regular expressions are worth the CPU cycles, and the trouble.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The thing that Regular Expression are used for in BDD statements,</p>\n  <p>is fishing out variables.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So when we say &quot;And the squirrel is really hungry.&quot;,</p>\n  <p>the word &quot;really&quot; specifies how hungry the squirrel is.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Regular expressions really shine here if we have multiple things to match,</p>\n  <p>and now that Regular Expressions have named capture groups, you can actually see what a particular pattern is after.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Basically, once you take a bunch of JavaScript and node.js tutorials,</p>\n  <p>you are going to need some interesting ideas.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Writing your own WiliKiki is a great idea,</p>\n  <p>until you are finished writing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To make it useful,</p>\n  <p>or even to make a business inspiration out of it, you have to make it do something useful.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To make it fascinating,</p>\n  <p>you have to open it to the world so that others can edit your program.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is up to you to figure out how to bless that alien code,</p>\n  <p>look at he way software on github grows, when someone writes new code, it is sent to the program&apos;s owner as a request to merge code.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This way everything is submitted in small readable chunks,</p>\n  <p>and gets reviewed without much confusion.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Creating a text game, where thousands of people can edit the story,</p>\n  <p>and then enter the world and watch others solve the puzzles they created can be a fun little project.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Something more advanced and more business minded,</p>\n  <p>can be a WikiWiki that uses Tone.js to create a clone of the Leading Digital Workstation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is really difficult to write large programs by yourself,</p>\n  <p>but if you have thousands of contributors, some working for tips, for bounties, or big prizes then a large program can be made pretty quickly.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The issue of managing hundreds of thousands of tasks and thousands developers becomes greatly simplified,</p>\n  <p>when you use something like BDD, especially BDD that has been finely tuned to your program.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Programmers write programs for self education and fun,</p>\n  <p>but when it comes to large applications, learn from the success of the World Encyclopedia.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div

<p>But I can show you how to do it in such a way,</p>\n  <p>so that other programmers may join you for fun or some meaningful reward.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Whatever it is build it a page at a time,</p>\n  <p>combine WikiWiki with BDD, maybe MUD, and make the story more important than the code as demonstrated by <a

class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The squirrel has a property of hungry,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">since our story seems to

<div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Since we don't want to do any special math,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text

</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">An object is a perfect and precise thing,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">though it can contain a list, don't think of it as a singe unit, where you set it and

text-center\">In the world of databases, in order to allow billions of records,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">you really want to keep objects and lists separate, and load their data separately and treat each with respect.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The kind of thinking where you say I created a squirrel with a number expressing hunger and an inventory list that may hold a peanut is too simple,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and won't translate well to databases.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Just think of it as an object with properties, that also has a list called inventory,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">not object with properties where one of the properties is a list, be respectful of data structures, keep them loosely coupled.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph

mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Now that we have a world,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">we know that the

</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">So now we have to describe some action,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">something that will cause a change.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">If we were just writing a normal story in an

class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Same thing is happening here, but the two things STORY CONTEXT, and ACTION EVENT, must be kept separate,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and we have to be serious about this, because somewhere down the road we may add a new ACTION EVENT, that reuses the story so that we can test something else.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The STORY CONTEXT will stay the same,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph

class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">If we keep out BDD nice and tidy,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">if we are keeping context separate from action, it will all be very easy to understand.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">So in this ACTION EVENT,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">we'll just make the squirrel simply notice the peanut, jump down from the tree, and put it in her little cheek.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">And that is it, but this is a lot,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">because now, the tree no longer contains the squirrel, the ground no longer contains the peanut, all kinds of things have changed.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mb-5 section-spacer\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">So now we add the OUTCOME TEST,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">this is what BDD, and all this crazy story writing is about.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">We now describe the state of the things in the stuck-a-penut-in-her-cheek world,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and if the program does not behave the same way as the outcome, we know that it is unfinished or broken, and can send a programmer in here.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Our test of outcome must at least describe that the peanut and squirrel have moved,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">that the squirrel is on the ground and the peanut, well, is in the squirrel, we don't care if cheeks or in her stomach, we don't care if the peanut is whole, or crunched up.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The little details are unimportant to our game,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">nobody cares to test these details, nobody cares to pay programmers to test them.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Think of it as doing scientific research, and trying to figure out what the structure of DNA is,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">if you come across another molecule, one that is not the point of your research, you just don't pay attention to

class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">To give some structure to what is basically text,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">BDD developers

 <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Just to be precise of what is what, the story description starts with the word given, the action description starts with the word when,

<div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The types of games that deal with Squirrels, or Virtual Worlds for that matter, are

my-5 text-center\">and when the game is executed for real, the squirrel will examine its environment, while muttering something about leaves and trees,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text

 <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Here is one such program called <a

class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Once you write a tiny MUD,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">then you create a program called test, and import your world as a module.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">And begin executing the BDD tests,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">you load up the story file we created, and just parse beginning with the first line:</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph

card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">You instruct your MUD to create a new world,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">create a tree object,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">create a squirrel object,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5

my-5 text-center\">so you set the hunger value of the squirrel object to 1,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">or maybe energy value of squirrel to 0.01, meaning it is running out of energy and only food can restore it in context of this game.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">And continue on,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">when you develop your MUD you define plants, trees, animals, so it is really easy to just get them in here and set them up for the purpose of this test.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mb-5

text-center\">The way you parse a line of text, that you loaded from a file is kind of unusual in BDD systems,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">what you want to do is create a tiny program precisely named after the line, so if the line changes the program becomes dissociated, it goes away.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The easiest way to associate a program with \"Given the world has squirrel in a tree.\",</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">is just creating a function or a file named after the slugged version of this sentence, to make a slug, is to lowercase everything and replace spaced with hyphens, simplify it.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Another way, is to use <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhzKDrUiJVk\">regular expressions</a>, JavaScript has named capture groups now,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">so regular expressions are much easier.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section

class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">regular expressions are used on the Unix command line as well, so you'd be learning something that is useful in other places.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">There are plenty of <a href=\"https://regexr.com/\">Regular Expression Visualization Tools</a>,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">so you can see how the matches are occurring.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5

</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I

shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">In terms of how frequently you use that kind of thing in programming,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">not often, instead of matching something to recognize it, you really want to specify a type for the

videos</a>,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">instead of searching for something that looks like a youtube id, which is costly in terms of CPU cycles...</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I state \"type: youtube\",</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and there is no question that the id that follows is a video id.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">But when you are dealing with something like parsing English in a BDD line of text,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">then regular expressions are worth the CPU cycles, and the trouble.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The thing that Regular Expression are used for in BDD statements,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">is fishing out

text-center\">So when we say \"And the squirrel is really hungry.\",</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">the word \"really\" specifies how hungry the squirrel is.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5

have named capture groups, you can actually see what a particular pattern is after.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mb-5 section-spacer\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark

Development<sup>[15]</sup></span> or BDD for short, describes computer programs in plain English,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">leaving it to programmers to fill in what is broken.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">BDD is very simple,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but I am yet to find a simple explanation.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">BDD is about writing stories about your program,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">these stories describe what is going on, what is about to happen, and what should be the result.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If what happened does not create the expected result,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">then you will know that part of your program is either broken or unfinished.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Let us begin programming a simple game,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">where squirrel eat peanuts.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">First we describe the world,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There is a peanut on the ground, a tree, a squirrel in the tree, and she is really hungry.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In the world of computers you have four <span>objects<sup>[16]</sup></span> here:</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">peanut, ground, tree, squirrel.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The squirrel has a property of hungry,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">since our story seems to hint on a squirrel that can be a bit hungry, rather than a true or false, lets make the property a percent.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Since we don't want to do any special math,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we will express percent as a fraction between 0 and 1, where zero is not quite hungry but may eat something, and one is really hungry and about to pass out for a little while.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Let's tidy up the place a bit, and create a world for our objects,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so now world contains ground, ground contains peanut, and tree, and tree contains squirrel.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In computer world there are primitive variables like number or fraction,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but also complex variables like objects that can contain a primitive like hungry, or list like inventory.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Though it is tempting to think of everything as a variable,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">don't do that too much.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">An object is a perfect and precise thing,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">though it can contain a list, don't think of it as a singe unit, where you set it and forget it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In the world of databases, in order to allow billions of records,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you really want to keep objects and lists separate, and load their data separately and treat each with respect.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The kind of thinking where you say I created a squirrel with a number expressing hunger and an inventory list that may hold a peanut is too simple,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and won't translate well to databases.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Just think of it as an object with properties, that also has a list called inventory,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">not object with properties where one of the properties is a list, be respectful of data structures, keep them loosely coupled.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If everything becomes too tightly bound,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you will cut yourself off from easily speaking to simple databases.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now that we have a world,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we know that the squirrel isn't doing anything.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is just really hungry,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it is like world without anything going on.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So now we have to describe some action,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">something that will cause a change.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If we were just writing a normal story in an essay,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we would first describe the world, and then what was going on in that world.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Same thing is happening here, but the two things STORY CONTEXT, and ACTION EVENT, must be kept separate,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and we have to be serious about this, because somewhere down the road we may add a new ACTION EVENT, that reuses the story so that we can test something else.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The STORY CONTEXT will stay the same,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we will only add an ACTION EVENT, or a hundred of them.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If we keep out BDD nice and tidy,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">if we are keeping context separate from action, it will all be very easy to understand.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So in this ACTION EVENT,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we'll just make the squirrel simply notice the peanut, jump down from the tree, and put it in her little cheek.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And that is it, but this is a lot,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because now, the tree no longer contains the squirrel, the ground no longer contains the peanut, all kinds of things have changed.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So now we add the OUTCOME TEST,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">this is what BDD, and all this crazy story writing is about.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We now describe the state of the things in the stuck-a-penut-in-her-cheek world,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and if the program does not behave the same way as the outcome, we know that it is unfinished or broken, and can send a programmer in here.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Our test of outcome must at least describe that the peanut and squirrel have moved,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that the squirrel is on the ground and the peanut, well, is in the squirrel, we don't care if cheeks or in her stomach, we don't care if the peanut is whole, or crunched up.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The little details are unimportant to our game,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">nobody cares to test these details, nobody cares to pay programmers to test them.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Think of it as doing scientific research, and trying to figure out what the structure of DNA is,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">if you come across another molecule, one that is not the point of your research, you just don't pay attention to it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To give some structure to what is basically text,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">BDD developers came up with a language that sort of everyone agrees on using.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Just to be precise of what is what, the story description starts with the word given, the action description starts with the word when, and the outcome description starts with the word then.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So, given, when, then,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">given this type of a world, when this thing happens, then this stuff should be true.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When other programmers read your BDD they will be familiar with the Given, When, Then method of story writing,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and will continue playing along so that now you are going to be able to read any new tests they add.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Let us describe our squirrel story in BDD syntax now,</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Given the world has squirrel in a tree</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And the squirrel is really hungry</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And there is a peanut on the ground</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When the squirrel notices the peanut</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Then the squirrel leaves the tree</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And gets on the ground</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And puts the peanut in her cheek</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When the squirrel eats the peanut,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Then the squirrel is no longer really hungry.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Note how I added a second when, where the squirrel actually ate the peanut,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I actually reused the STORY CONTEXT, I just added a new action event.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Also note that I chain things with the word \"And\" as in:</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the squirrel leaves the tree, AND gets on the ground, AND puts the peanut in her cheek.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This syntax exists for the purpose for keeping BDD programs simple,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">dealing with English text is a difficult problem, but if we just patiently take that one extra step and use Given, When, Then, and And, it makes a world of difference.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I don't want to tell you this as not to mix anything up,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but personally, I kind of think of this syntax as a subset of English, one that is just used amongs us the programmers.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Yes,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you are a programmer now.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And now you may wish to ask,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">well how the heck do I run this thing?</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Is there a program?</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and how will it know about squirrels?</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You will have to write two programs to run the squirrel world,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">first is the game that we are describing.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And the second, is a testing framework</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">where we will import the game, and pretend we are a player, while running the tests.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The types of games that deal with Squirrels, or Virtual Worlds for that matter, are called <span>MUD<sup>[17]</sup></span>s,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">or Multi User Dungeons, or Multi User Dungeons Object Oriented.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Writing a MUD is a fun way to learn programming,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you can probably do it in 20 lines of code, but you may actually fall in love with programming mini worlds, and grow them to a million lines of code.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If you are not into computer games,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">then you should know a mud can be used to generate poetry.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">For example imagine, that the world exists in a poet's mind,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and when the game is executed for real, the squirrel will examine its environment, while muttering something about leaves and trees,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and then rhyme something poetic about peanuts, hunger, and how they are crunchy.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Here is one such program called <span>limerick<sup>[18]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it took no effort to create it, it was just a lot of fun.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Once you write a tiny MUD,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">then you create a program called test, and import your world as a module.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And begin executing the BDD tests,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you load up the story file we created, and just parse beginning with the first line:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">\"Given the world has squirrel in a tree.\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You instruct your MUD to create a new world,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">create a tree object,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">create a squirrel object,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and then add the squirrel to tree.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Now you just move onto the second line,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">\"And the squirrel is really hungry\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so you set the hunger value of the squirrel object to 1,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">or maybe energy value of squirrel to 0.01, meaning it is running out of energy and only food can restore it in context of this game.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And continue on,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">when you develop your MUD you define plants, trees, animals, so it is really easy to just get them in here and set them up for the purpose of this test.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The way you parse a line of text, that you loaded from a file is kind of unusual in BDD systems,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">what you want to do is create a tiny program precisely named after the line, so if the line changes the program becomes dissociated, it goes away.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The easiest way to associate a program with \"Given the world has squirrel in a tree.\",</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is just creating a function or a file named after the slugged version of this sentence, to make a slug, is to lowercase everything and replace spaced with hyphens, simplify it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Another way, is to use <span>regular expressions<sup>[19]</sup></span>, JavaScript has named capture groups now,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so regular expressions are much easier.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Here is an <span>example of a regular expression in the wild<sup>[20]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">parsing the sentence and variations of \"What are the three laws?\", see line number 26.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">As you are learning programming,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">do what feels right for you.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Personally, this would be where I'd take a moment to grok regex once and for all,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">regular expressions are used on the Unix command line as well, so you'd be learning something that is useful in other places.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There are plenty of <span>Regular Expression Visualization Tools<sup>[21]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so you can see how the matches are occurring.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If you don't feel right about learning regex,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">don't do it, it is an acquired taste.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I think a lot of people just google <span>regex how do I match email address<sup>[22]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and just go with the results until they start seeing patterns and finally take the plunge.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In terms of how frequently you use that kind of thing in programming,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">not often, instead of matching something to recognize it, you really want to specify a type for the thing.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><span>Take a look at how I create pages of YouTube videos<sup>[23]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">instead of searching for something that looks like a youtube id, which is costly in terms of CPU cycles...</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I state \"type: youtube\",</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and there is no question that the id that follows is a video id.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But when you are dealing with something like parsing English in a BDD line of text,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">then regular expressions are worth the CPU cycles, and the trouble.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\"

  "text": "Programming is simple, friendly, rewarding, fun, and relaxing,\nit will set you free from poverty and drive you to make the world a better place.\nPeople who think it is funny to say that,\nare that people that brainlessly walked into some high stress meat-grinder and now hate life.\nAs with everything else, if you are forced to learn programming,\nand forced to program under a threat of bankruptcy and poverty it will seem awful.\nOne of our first responsibilities in life,\nis t push toxic people and environments away.\nThere is nothing negative in the world of programming,\nit is an art like everything else.\n\nJust like it is not perfect, to sit down to learning how to paint with a cup of tea or coffee as paint,\nand paper that is not really all that good for water colors, and a brush that could be better.\n\nYou have to assemble your programming environment with a kind of love,\nand you will need a mascot to keep you company and for Duck Debugging[1].\nIt does not need to be a duck,\nI have a Fuggler, the Red Suspicions Fox, and I called him Boo Boo, or Boobs for short, after an angry dog I like.\nYour computer should be the 8GB Raspberry Pi 4 Model B[2],\nmaybe get a Raspberry Pi 400 as your secondary[3].\nYou will need a monitor, keyboard, mouse,\nand possibly an external drive.\nI would recommend that you get a simple monitor,\nthe raspberry PI supports two 4K monitors but all of that is overpriced.\nConsider getting a mechanical keyboard[4],\nperhaps AKKO[5] or Anne Pro[6]\nYour programming language should be ES2021, or whatever year you are in,\nthis is the evolving JavaScript language.\nI know many programming languages,\nbut I don't have time to use them all, there is no point in learning a language that you will not use 5 years from now.\nYou have to learn the language of the web,\nit works in the browser, in application frameworks like Electron[7] or p5.js[8] or Tone.js[9], and on the server, and your Raspberry PI.\nYou will need to install Node.js[10],\nand search internet videos for node.js tutorials[11].\n\nBut, above all you need a reason,\nsomething you are or can be passionate about.\nAnd it has to be something that many people can work on at the same time,\nso something inspired by WikiWiki the program that inspired MediaWiki behind Wikipedia.\nSee the point is to allow strangers to come in and contribute to your program,\nby just clicking EDIT, without signing up for anything, without giving their email.\nI am gratly inspired by the SCP Wiki,\neven though it is not a computer program, though it is a kind of a game, or a kind.\nJust this morning I was reading about SCP-087[12] and I didn't finish, I stopped at Document 087-I,\nand the hell with it all, I actually had to turn my lights up.\nSee multiple people are contributing to a single story, or - an almost a game,\nand that is the platform that you must start with.\n\nYou will have to program your own WikiWiki,\nand allow people to enter code into it via CodeMirror[13].\nI can't tell you what your project should be about,\nbut it should contain your own take on BDD[14] so that you can focus on sketching and let others code it for you.\n\nBehavior Driven Development[15] or BDD for short, describes computer programs in plain English,\nleaving it to programmers to fill in what is broken.\nBDD is very simple,\nbut I am yet to find a simple explanation.\nBDD is about writing stories about your program,\nthese stories describe what is going on, what is about to happen, and what should be the result.\nIf what happened does not create the expected result,\nthen you will know that part of your program is either broken or unfinished.\nLet us begin programming a simple game,\nwhere squirrel eat peanuts.\n\nFirst we describe the world,\nThere is a peanut on the ground, a tree, a squirrel in the tree, and she is really hungry.\nIn the world of computers you have four objects[16] here:\npeanut, ground, tree, squirrel.\nThe squirrel has a property of hungry,\nsince our story seems to hint on a squirrel that can be a bit hungry, rather than a true or false, lets make the property a percent.\nSince we don't want to do any special math,\nwe will express percent as a fraction between 0 and 1, where zero is not quite hungry but may eat something, and one is really hungry and about to pass out for a little while.\n\nLet's tidy up the place a bit, and create a world for our objects,\nso now world contains ground, ground contains peanut, and tree, and tree contains squirrel.\nIn computer world there are primitive variables like number or fraction,\nbut also complex variables like objects that can contain a primitive like hungry, or list like inventory.\n\nThough it is tempting to think of everything as a variable,\ndon't do that too much.\nAn object is a perfect and precise thing,\nthough it can contain a list, don't think of it as a singe unit, where you set it and forget it.\nIn the world of databases, in order to allow billions of records,\nyou really want to keep objects and lists separate, and load their data separately and treat each with respect.\nThe kind of thinking where you say I created a squirrel with a number expressing hunger and an inventory list that may hold a peanut is too simple,\nand won't translate well to databases.\nJust think of it as an object with properties, that also has a list called inventory,\nnot object with properties where one of the properties is a list, be respectful of data structures, keep them loosely coupled.\nIf everything becomes too tightly bound,\nyou will cut yourself off from easily speaking to simple databases.\n\nNow that we have a world,\nwe know that the squirrel isn't doing anything.\nIt is just really hungry,\nit is like world without anything going on.\nSo now we have to describe some action,\nsomething that will cause a change.\nIf we were just writing a normal story in an essay,\nwe would first describe the world, and then what was going on in that world.\nSame thing is happening here, but the two things STORY CONTEXT, and ACTION EVENT, must be kept separate,\nand we have to be serious about this, because somewhere down the road we may add a new ACTION EVENT, that reuses the story so that we can test something else.\nThe STORY CONTEXT will stay the same,\nwe will only add an ACTION EVENT, or a hundred of them.\nIf we keep out BDD nice and tidy,\nif we are keeping context separate from action, it will all be very easy to understand.\nSo in this ACTION EVENT,\nwe'll just make the squirrel simply notice the peanut, jump down from the tree, and put it in her little cheek.\nAnd that is it, but this is a lot,\nbecause now, the tree no longer contains the squirrel, the ground no longer contains the peanut, all kinds of things have changed.\n\nSo now we add the OUTCOME TEST,\nthis is what BDD, and all this crazy story writing is about.\nWe now describe the state of the things in the stuck-a-penut-in-her-cheek world,\nand if the program does not behave the same way as the outcome, we know that it is unfinished or broken, and can send a programmer in here.\nOur test of outcome must at least describe that the peanut and squirrel have moved,\nthat the squirrel is on the ground and the peanut, well, is in the squirrel, we don't care if cheeks or in her stomach, we don't care if the peanut is whole, or crunched up.\nThe little details are unimportant to our game,\nnobody cares to test these details, nobody cares to pay programmers to test them.\nThink of it as doing scientific research, and trying to figure out what the structure of DNA is,\nif you come across another molecule, one that is not the point of your research, you just don't pay attention to it.\n\nTo give some structure to what is basically text,\nBDD developers came up with a language that sort of everyone agrees on using.\nJust to be precise of what is what, the story description starts with the word given, the action description starts with the word when, and the outcome description starts with the word then.\nSo, given, when, then,\ngiven this type of a world, when this thing happens, then this stuff should be true.\nWhen other programmers read your BDD they will be familiar with the Given, When, Then method of story writing,\nand will continue playing along so that now you are going to be able to read any new tests they add.\n\nLet us describe our squirrel story in BDD syntax now,\nGiven the world has squirrel in a tree\nAnd the squirrel is really hungry\nAnd there is a peanut on the ground\nWhen the squirrel notices the peanut\nThen the squirrel leaves the tree\nAnd gets on the ground\nAnd puts the peanut in her cheek\nWhen the squirrel eats the peanut,\nThen the squirrel is no longer really hungry.\nNote how I added a second when, where the squirrel actually ate the peanut,\nI actually reused the STORY CONTEXT, I just added a new action event.\nAlso note that I chain things with the word \"And\" as in:\nthe squirrel leaves the tree, AND gets on the ground, AND puts the peanut in her cheek.\nThis syntax exists for the purpose for keeping BDD programs simple,\ndealing with English text is a difficult problem, but if we just patiently take that one extra step and use Given, When, Then, and And, it makes a world of difference.\nI don't want to tell you this as not to mix anything up,\nbut personally, I kind of think of this syntax as a subset of English, one that is just used amongs us the programmers.\nYes,\nyou are a programmer now.\n\nAnd now you may wish to ask,\nwell how the heck do I run this thing?\nIs there a program?\nand how will it know about squirrels?\n\nYou will have to write two programs to run the squirrel world,\nfirst is the game that we are describing.\nAnd the second, is a testing framework\nwhere we will import the game, and pretend we are a player, while running the tests.\n\nThe types of games that deal with Squirrels, or Virtual Worlds for that matter, are called MUD[17]s,\nor Multi User Dungeons, or Multi User Dungeons Object Oriented.\nWriting a MUD is a fun way to learn programming,\nyou can probably do it in 20 lines of code, but you may actually fall in love with programming mini worlds, and grow them to a million lines of code.\nIf you are not into computer games,\nthen you should know a mud can be used to generate poetry.\nFor example imagine, that the world exists in a poet's mind,\nand when the game is executed for real, the squirrel will examine its environment, while muttering something about leaves and trees,\nand then rhyme something poetic about peanuts, hunger, and how they are crunchy.\nHere is one such program called limerick[18],\nit took no effort to create it, it was just a lot of fun.\n\nOnce you write a tiny MUD,\nthen you create a program called test, and import your world as a module.\nAnd begin executing the BDD tests,\nyou load up the story file we created, and just parse beginning with the first line:\n\"Given the world has squirrel in a tree.\"\nYou instruct your MUD to create a new world,\ncreate a tree object,\ncreate a squirrel object,\nand then add the squirrel to tree.\nNow you just move onto the second line,\n\"And the squirrel is really hungry\"\nso you set the hunger value of the squirrel object to 1,\nor maybe energy value of squirrel to 0.01, meaning it is running out of energy and only food can restore it in context of this game.\nAnd continue on,\nwhen you develop your MUD you define plants, trees, animals, so it is really easy to just get them in here and set them up for the purpose of this test.\n\nThe way you parse a line of text, that you loaded from a file is kind of unusual in BDD systems,\nwhat you want to do is create a tiny program precisely named after the line, so if the line changes the program becomes dissociated, it goes away.\nThe easiest way to associate a program with \"Given the world has squirrel in a tree.\",\nis just creating a function or a file named after the slugged version of this sentence, to make a slug, is to lowercase everything and replace spaced with hyphens, simplify it.\nAnother way, is to use regular expressions[19], JavaScript has named capture groups now,\nso regular expressions are much easier.\nHere is an example of a regular expression in the wild[20],\nparsing the sentence and variations of \"What are the three laws?\", see line number 26.\nAs you are learning programming,\ndo what feels right for you.\nPersonally, this would be where I'd take a moment to grok regex once and for all,\nregular expressions are used on the Unix command line as well, so you'd be learning something that is useful in other places.\nThere are plenty of Regular Expression Visualization Tools[21],\nso you can see how the matches are occurring.\nIf you don't feel right about learning regex,\ndon't do it, it is an acquired taste.\nI think a lot of people just google regex how do I match email address[22],\nand just go with the results until they start seeing patterns and finally take the plunge.\nIn terms of how frequently you use that kind of thing in programming,\nnot often, instead of matching something to recognize it, you really want to specify a type for the thing.\nTake a look at how I create pages of YouTube videos[23],\ninstead of searching for something that looks like a youtube id, which is costly in terms of CPU cycles...\nI state \"type: youtube\",\nand there is no question that the id that follows is a video id.\nBut when you are dealing with something like parsing English in a BDD line of text,\nthen regular expressions are worth the CPU cycles, and the trouble.\nThe thing that Regular Expression are used for in BDD statements,\nis fishing out variables.\nSo when we say \"And the squirrel is really hungry.\",\nthe word \"really\" specifies how hungry the squirrel is.\nRegular expressions really shine here if we have multiple things to match,\nand now that Regular Expressions have named capture groups, you can actually see what a particular pattern is after.\n\nBasically, once you take a bunch of JavaScript and node.js tutorials,\nyou are going to need some interesting ideas.\nWriting your own WiliKiki is a great idea,\nuntil you are finished writing.\nTo make it useful,\nor even to make a business inspiration out of it, you have to make it do something useful.\nTo make it fascinating,\nyou have to open it to the world so that others can edit your program.\nIt is up to you to figure out how to bless that alien code,\nlook at he way software on github grows, when someone writes new code, it is sent to the program's owner as a request to merge code.\nThis way everything is submitted in small readable chunks,\nand gets reviewed without much confusion.\nCreating a text game, where thousands of people can edit the story,\nand then enter the world and watch others solve the puzzles they created can be a fun little project.\nSomething more advanced and more business minded,\ncan be a WikiWiki that uses Tone.js to create a clone of the Leading Digital Workstation.\nIt is really difficult to write large programs by yourself,\nbut if you have thousands of contributors, some working for tips, for bounties, or big prizes then a large program can be made pretty quickly.\nThe issue of managing hundreds of thousands of tasks and thousands developers becomes greatly simplified,\nwhen you use something like BDD, especially BDD that has been finely tuned to your program.\n\nProgrammers write programs for self education and fun,\nbut when it comes to large applications, learn from the success of the World Encyclopedia.\nIt is very difficult to inspire you to a program you may wish to create,\nI can't really help you with dreaming it up.\nBut I can show you how to do it in such a way,\nso that other programmers may join you for fun or some meaningful reward.\nWhatever it is build it a page at a time,\ncombine WikiWiki with BDD, maybe MUD, and make the story more important than the code as demonstrated by Literate programming[24].\nProgramming is just another form of art,\njust learn at the pace that fits you best, and in a sequence that matches what you already know, without anybody timing you or telling you what to learn.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging\n[2]:

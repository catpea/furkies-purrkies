There cannot be jogging without acting crazy,
if you're not snarling and spitting you're just being lazy.
Not to mention that its discussing to swallow those little files,
you're not supposed to keep them, they're not your prize.
Ultimately, it makes no difference what race it may be,
manners go out the window, the moment you bend your knee.

Plus, nobody really runs to win the race,
we just set the correct pace and run to find our place in Space.
The physical challenge is found in taking each step,
and not stopping until the last rep.
But that's easy, it is the simplest thing about it all,
your body just gets used to it, and has a ball.

Jogging is mostly a little reminder that we are to turn our life to Art,
that we are to overcome our limits, and become super smart.
The actual achievement is found in finishing what we start,
and the thousand other things we finish, by subtle analogy to this odd Art.
In a word, we jog for our future selves,
so that they may become proud of themselves.

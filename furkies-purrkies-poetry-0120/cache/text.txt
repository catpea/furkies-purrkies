Anything that can go wrong may go wrong,
and there is only one guarantee in life.
It is a guarantee, precisely because it is within our complete control,
the guarantee is The Greatness Of Our Soul, or Spirit, or Being.
It means you will keep getting up no matter how many times you fall,
it means you will continue moving forward without stopping.

It means there is no pain, it means there is no weakness,
that it is a function and fact of life that we advance forward.
And on the day of triumph,
it means that the prize is nothing less than Laughter and Joy of Life.
The Greatness of Our Soul, our single guarantee in life,
may begin in discomfort, but it concludes with something far more.

Marvels of the Human Spirit that we can't directly conjure up within ourselves,
marvels that can only come out of our Might and Authenticity.
Humor and Foolishness, Cheerfulness and Bliss,
Sweetens and Giggles, Joy, Laughter, Wisdom and Delight.
Greatness of Soul.

  <p>Well, from time to time,<br>a local train blocks the way to or from my adventure.</p>
  <p>Because the main road goes above the track,<br>and only bicyclists take the old stretch.</p>
  <p>The trains can be parked there for hours,<br>the only other way to get across is the above overpass.</p>
  <p>I did it once,<br>but it was very dangerous, and there were large holes in the road.</p>
  <p>There was no way to get home,<br>but to hop over the train.</p>
  <p>A gentleman was already fidgeting on the other side,<br>he must have been waiting for a while.</p>
  <p>When I arrived at the tracks,<br>the breaks made a sound, but it was nothing.</p>
  <p>We waited and waited,<br>until the gentleman decided to throw his bicycle over the assembly connecting the train.</p>
  <p>I grabbed the bicycle he threw to the ground and dragged it off to safety,<br>as he made his crossing.</p>

  <p>It was my time to go, and seeing that I was helpful,<br>he offered to help me.</p>
  <p>But my tank of a bicycle was already half way up,<br>I got it up on the train car platform in a single go.</p>
  <p>He had a sports bicycle, it was light, small, and bouncy,<br>my bicycle needed to go up on the train, then then I need it to push it to the other end, and pull it down.</p>
  <p>So I quickly replied, "No, this is just part of the adventure.",<br>and he was already answering his own question "No you don't need help."</p>
  <p>As my bicycle, wallet and phone, became part of the train cargo,<br>I had to hurry!</p>
  <p>To get on top of the train,<br>I had to use the ladder.</p>

  <p>And you know what, the moment I grabbed on to it,<br>I felt like I belonged there - like I was destined to be a train engineer.</p>
  <p>Though I am a very quiet and a well mannered person,<br>as I pulled my self up on the ladder.</p>
  <p>I let out a great big.<br>"Heeeeeeeee Hawwwww!".</p>
  <p>The ladder had only one real step,<br>but it worked well, and it gave me a good and refreshing cat like stretch.</p>
  <p>The moment I got on top of the train though,<br>I really don't know what got into me.</p>
  <p>I looked at the stranger who was some feet away,<br>and yelled "If I don't make it down from here, I am headed to Ohhhhh Hi...O!".</p>
  <p>The stranger quickly hurried away after that,<br>and it was now my bicycle, my wallet, my phone, and I who was the cargo - Yikes.</p>
  <p>As I was standing up there gathering my thoughts,<br>I realized - this is pretty wild in contrast to my FreeCAD tutorials - and decided to get down as quickly as possible.</p>
  <p>I led my tank of a bicycle, now for some reason 50 pounds heavier across the car,<br>and rather than going back for the other ladder decided to jump down.</p>
  <p>I haven't jumped this far down since I was showing off when I was eight or ten or so,<br>instantly I misjudged the height, and as I thought I was about to land, I had a foot to go.</p>
  <p>I landed as gracefully as a Great Warrior,<br>Arrr!</p>
  <p>I grabbed my bicycle,<br>and pulled it down.</p>
  <p>And just like that,<br>my adventure in the middle of an adventure - was over.</p>
  <p>I was no longer a train hopping hoodlum and no goodnik punk,<br>I was now an ordinary bodybuilder with a tank for a bicycle.</p>
  <p>No one will even know,<br>that I almost made it to Ohio.</p>

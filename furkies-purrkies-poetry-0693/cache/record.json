is a huge problem in product creation:<br>a lot of products come with expiration dates.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">And we are not talking about fruit here,<br>but some of the biggest product ideas that exist today.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Apps for phones, Themes for websites, even Electron Desktop programs,<br>need constant support.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">This may seem obvious and until you compare these support needs,<br>with a finer category of products, let us call them Static Products.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">My favorite example of a product is a seemingly trivial series of

finer category of products, let us call them Static Products.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">My favorite example of a product is a seemingly trivial series of backgrounds,<br>imagine something made of of blurry circles that borrows from colors of steel.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Imagine offering that re-sized, cropped, and masked (to allow for transparency) for all the common resolutions,<br>from Apple Icons, 1024x768 Desktop Size, to 1080p, 4K, and 8K.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is something you put in a zip file,<br>upload to Creative Market and never have to

effort that goes into maintenance of applications and less static products is so massive,<br>that at the end of the day, it may seem like making a little bit less money would be, better.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Companies obviously want to maximize profits,<br>they will jump at the most complex that sells a the highest prices.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But the truth is that both simple products and complex can make big money,<br>but the simple products will only ever present simple problems, and that is a magnificent power.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I propose that rather than you making complex products,<br>you automatically generate simple ones with custom software that you never put on the market.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And then once everything blooms, and you have a hundred products that look OK,<br>you then turn around and sell your company.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And the first thing you are going to tell you potential buyers,<br>is that your company sells simple products, that require no maintenance.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A person who wants to purchase a company,<br>does not want to support all the copies of the product, they just

to over the network,<br>and you have a web user interface,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This means the program is setup once, and never needs to be re-installed,<br>it just runs on that machine, is any dependency does change, the virtual machine can be reverted back to an earlier state.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">App publishers can't do this, they are forced to upgrade frameworks,

great to have your product generated purely by a machine.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Once you see that you are making a bit of money,<br>why not use some of that money to employ an internet artist to make a unique design for you.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">How about a Horse, it will look great on a Blanket, Car Wrap, Desktop Background,<br>and even a T-Shirt.</div>\n</div>\n<div

<div class=\"paragraph\">You should treat this as an exercise to invent more powerful ideas,<br>build ever larger companies, and learn more and more about outstanding Open Source programs.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">While you need to learn to rapidly launch websites,<br>it is not all that good to host your own website at first.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I encourage you to build up a simple portfolio of products,<br>and maybe custom graphics and publish it on <span>Dribble<sup>[5]</sup></span>, <span>DeviantArt<sup>[6]</sup></span>, or similar.</div>\n  <div

Um, with the camera.\nHere you are tasked with becoming a photographer,\ntaking pictures of Cities, Graffiti, Mountains, and Urban Mornings.\nThis is by far the best way to establish a fantastic portfolio,\nyou might as well setup an UnSplash account where you give images away for free and sell some as clip-art while at it on a commercial website.\nA slightly more invoked source of Graphics, is Krita[8],\nhere you are tasked with becoming a digital painter.\nI encourage you to take a Hair Painting tutorial in Krita to see how something seemingly impossible, takes but a few minutes to learn[9],\nso as long as you follow the simple procedure and create a little dark to light palette.\nA variation on Desktop Backgrounds and Beyond is Texture Sales,\nthis product is aimed at Designers that are yet to create custom graphics, take a look at Creative Market Graphic Textures for a nice Example[10].\nTextures are also useful for 3D modeling, there are a few more files that you may need to provide,\nbut this can be automated.\nTo learn about Texturing 3D models take a few Texturing Tutorials[11],\nand learn how to use Blender[12], it is very natural, and extremely rewarding.\nEspecially if you get into 3D printing, which I highly recommend,\nas it will constantly encourage you to learn more and more about 3D modeling.\nThe worlds of 3D modeling and 2D painting are a step towards animation,\nand that means moving pictures.\nPeople make good money from internet videos,\nand they are often in need of video clip-art such as slow motion or time lapse and maybe even tilt shift videos.\nVideo products are similar to graphics, here you will film falling snow, Urban Sunsets,\nbusy intersections, and sell that as clip-art, that others may include in their title screes or in the background of their credits, or even ads.\nMy favorite spin-off product in this area,\nis leaving a camera overnight to record full 24 hours of sounds and commotions of summer days in Parks and Forests.\nYou can offer that as Stress Relief or a Sleep Aid product[13],\nespecially great for winter.\nCreating Couch to 5K or 10K workout programs,\nis yet another idea worth exploring, here you would be building a video fitness company.\n\nOn the other side of video is of course audio,\nand here you have, [lmms], another program you can study - here - to create custom music for your inventions.\nSimple drum songs go a long way to aid in workouts,\nand as with everything else you can get local musicians to build up a fetching library of song, that will make your company shine.\n\nThese are simple products,\nbut their Business Power lies in never requiring maintenance and thus creating a fetching company idea.\nTry to view your companies as an internet bussines person\nwilling to spend a few thousand dollars to Micro Acquire a promising company.\nThey will not be interested in purchasing software that needs constant tweaking and security work,\nbut a dozens of high resolution works of art that cover a range of purposes, from phone icons to backgrounds, wall posters, and blankets.\n...Or time lapse videos of snow piling up, or slow motion birds, or ocean,\nrepresent quite a headache free library.\nOnce you sell a company,\nyou just make another, start with a simple logo and a short dot-com name.\nThere is just great power in simplicity, and we must learn to say no to complexity,\nthe static products will simply not weigh your buyers down with maintenance, bugs, security considerations, and even usage tutorials.\nWith each product you create, and with each company you sell,\nyou will gain more and more confidence in your abilities, and business experience - eventually you'll make a cool little company that you won't want to sell.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2OL19GbtbY&t=153s\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=GIMP+Tutorial\n[3]: https://twitter.com/BuildSell30\n[4]: https://microacquire.com/\n[5]: https://dribbble.com/catpea\n[6]: https://www.deviantart.com/fantasyui-com\n[7]: https://creativemarket.com/\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Krita+Tutorial\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rO5dwPijfo\n[10]: https://creativemarket.com/graphics/textures\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10kJdVW8qOs\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Blender+Tutorial\n[13]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFFR3jvoUPY",

  <p>As the inventor in me purrs along,<br>pondering a little song.</p>
  <p>I am inventing new thingamabobs,<br>and redesigning all my door knobs.</p>
  <p>I must say, the wallet design number 40,<br>is starting to look pretty sporty.</p>
  <p>Design is extremely technical,<br>but comes out looking tactical.</p>

  <p>But this little song of mine,<br>is going to have an amazing baseline.</p>
  <p>As I broke new grounds,<br>by inventing all kinds of new sounds.</p>
  <p>I went around my house,<br>tapping at things at if to scare a mouse.</p>
  <p>I am getting ready to record my own drumkit,<br>so I am searching for all the sounds I can emit.</p>

  <p>In the programming universe,<br>I am building a new world anybody can traverse.</p>
  <p>I went back to the old idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOO">MOO</a>,<br>to create a text world anybody can venture to.</p>
  <p>And I merged it with WikiWiki,<br>to create a program that isn't very picky.</p>
  <p>To traverse the world,<br>the user has to carefully read what they are told.</p>
  <p>They will have to conquer many puzzles and quests,<br>though there will not be any tests.</p>
  <p>While this is still a tiny research tool,<br>maybe someday it could become a school.</p>

  <p>There is a million things I would like to do,<br>but I can only pick a few.</p>
  <p>I am really excited about jogging in cold weather,<br>when running on snow I feel like a feather.</p>
  <p>But there are only 71 days until the of winter,<br>so I better learn to shuffle like a sprinter.</p>

  <p>Life truly is plenty long, that is for sure,<br>but we should take care of our inventions until they mature.</p>
  <p>As inventing and thinking up new things,<br>gives our imagination wings.</p>
  <p>It is not so much about the invention it self,<br>after all it is just going to sit on the shelf.</p>
  <p>What it is truly about,<br>is eliminating inventor's doubt.</p>

  <p>Because the truth is, <strong>we are all inventors</strong>,<br>and we don't even need slowpoke mentors.</p>
  <p>We all have plenty of ideas on our own,<br>and we are <strong>always</strong> in the zone.</p>
  <p>You just start with a single brick,<br>and make sure that the next one will stick.</p>
  <p>Next thing you know you have a brand new thingamajig,<br>and a new invention, is <strong>always</strong> big.</p>

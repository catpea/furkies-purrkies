We brought students to schools,
and now time has come,
to bring schools to students.

We will now take great care to remove any and all political, cultural, religious indoctrination,
we will remove blind spots, bad ideas, grades, divisions, incompetent authority, and false promises.

Each student will mark their own trail with their own curiosities,
and that document will become their diploma.

Education will be life long,
lectures will be open and free.

There will be less potential for war,
Humanity will converge on the same body of good ideas.

Let us be,
One Family.

Simple ideas,
are most powerful.

Bring school to the student,
Converge on Wisdom.

Let us do our part,
and take care of Earth for all Generations.

  <p>It is not easy to figure out if you are an inventor or not,<br>and it is all to easy to judge ourselves by lack of ideas.</p>
  <p>Personally, I believe we are all inventors,<br>but I know a lot of people have their curiosities elsewhere.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03uoodl3mb8">3D printing is an amazing tool and it is not hard to learn</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLexwJr_iILK7IkuhEeAYeN7aLV5AAXKa-">and 3D modeling is not as intimidating as it sounds</a>.</p>
  <p>While inventing does not always have to end in sales,<br><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/980726073/golden-trickster-crown-made-in-us-diy">even something as simple as Loki's Horns may bring in $300,000</a>.</p>
  <p>Making a little bit of money along the way,<br>can be a neat motivational force and a fun reward.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKQ3apn5lbQ">There are 3D printers that have a convener belt instead of a platter</a>,<br>so as long as they are fed filament, they will just keep printing day and night.</p>
  <p>I often mention 3D printing because it is a powerful example,<br>of self education, creativity and invention.</p>

  <p>But there are many other areas that are worth exploring,<br>some can still produce physical objects.</p>
  <p>For example ordering cut sheet metal from a local company,<br>can result in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Survival-Card-Multitool-Bushcraft-Giftable/dp/B08NT2J34M/">sheet metal survival kits</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Router-Drawing-Plotter-Writing-Working/dp/B081B6VZYH">Using a drawing robot with a brush and canvas</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uo6zFwSO78">can create very interesting little paintings</a>.</p>

  <p>But physical products can be trouble,<br>and can cause worry.</p>
  <p>There are some exceptions such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDySIHVt6zA">printing on demand</a>,<br>which applies to both books and 3D printed objects and jewelry.</p>
  <p>And they hint on the simplest approach to inventing to inventing new things,<br>and that is dealing with digital things, even if just images.</p>
  <p>For example <a href="https://creativemarket.com/search?q=wood+textures&categoryIDs=1">selling photos of wood grains to graphic designers</a>,<br>can become quite an adventure.</p>
  <p>You would need to search for beautiful textures,<br>and just take photos and share and sell.</p>
  <p>There may not be a lot of money in digital sales,<br>but it is a fantastic stepping store towards becoming an inventor.</p>
  <p>Making just a few dollars with a unique idea,<br>can be all you need to launch you on a path towards becoming an inventor.</p>

  <p>Beyond Photography, to continue the example above,<br>you will find programming.</p>
  <p>More specifically automatically generating interesting backgrounds,<br>or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R9eywArFTE">Generative Art</a> as it is called.</p>
  <p>This is one of many interesting ways,<br>to get started with programming and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLglp04UYZK_PrN6xWo_nJ-8kzyXDyFUwi">graphic programming</a>.</p>
  <p>As you can imagine you don't have to generate 2D graphics,<br>you can take your knowledge of graphic programming right back to 3D printing.</p>
  <p>And automatically generate 3D art,<br>so what begins as selling some photos, and abstract art, can take you to an entirely unexplored area.</p>
  <p>Abstract 3D sculptures,<br>that never repeat.</p>

  <p>The path towards invention is about creating something,<br>with flexible tools that won't hold you back.</p>
  <p>3D Modeling, Drawing-Robots, Digital Photography, and Programming,<br>are all example of flexible tools that can get you started.</p>
  <p>And you don't have to start with an invention,<br>you just need to start by creating anything, for sale, display, or just fun.</p>
  <p>Invention, is found in the act of improving your favorite creations,<br>of dreaming up ways to make them more useful, or better.</p>
  <p>So as long as you are creating,<br>you never get stuck inventing.</p>

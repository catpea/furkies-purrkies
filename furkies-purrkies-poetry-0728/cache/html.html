  <p>Fantasy worlds create beautiful,<br>sometimes scary stories.</p>
  <p>But there is more to it,<br>because as you find comfort in creation of realistic portraits.</p>
  <p>You will surely ponder a new direction,<br>search for things that can enhance your art.</p>
  <p>Adventures into the worlds of fantasy,<br>are one such thing.</p>
  <p>Fantasy built on top of realism,<br>creates extremely valuable works of art.</p>

  <p>And please don't worry, as with portraits,<br>the road towards fantasy is paved with reference images.</p>
  <p>But here you move beyond head-shots, and even full body photos,<br>into speaking with color, style, pose, and composition.</p>
  <p>Despite what schools try to teach us,<br>it is always more responsible to prepare a library of all the reference photos you will need.</p>
  <p>For example, I! need butterflies to see if perhaps,<br>my elf painting could use a crown simiular to an 1869 work by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Gengembre_Anderson">Sophie Gengembre Anderson</a>.</p>
  <p>A work she entitles with a snippet of a poem by Charles Ede:<br>"Take the Fair Face of Woman, and Gently Suspending, With Butterflies, Flowers, and Jewels Attending, Thus Your Fairy is Made of Most Beautiful Things".</p>
  <p>And that is exactly what you need to upgrade your realistic portrait,<br>to a fairy version.</p>

  <p>Art is a beautiful adventure,<br>it has a song that will intertwine with yours.</p>
  <p>If fantasy worlds call to you,<br>than this is your next step.</p>
  <p>You will learn fast,<br>I barely begun and I already outgrew my first three works.</p>
  <p>My portfolio is down to just six pieces,<br>as if to make room for more fantastic realism.</p>
  <p>My Hoistu! cat does not belong in my art portfolio as it is too silly,<br>still it will make its way to my Art Book, so that nothing is lost.</p>

  <p>The adventure into the words of fantasy,<br>is a thing meant for art.</p>
  <p>And here we can directly speak of color, style, posture and composition,<br>as enhancing those to their maximums brings fantasy to life.</p>

  <p>We must ask if the original color palette of our reference image,<br>can be made better.</p>
  <p>I am currently working on an Elf,<br>and it is worth exploring more skin tones, more glow and fantasy.</p>
  <p>Beyond that, the atmosphere of the world of elves,<br>can lean towards the green like the Matrix, or yellow like Breaking Bread Mexico.</p>
  <p>We should call it Color Palette Enhancement,<br>it does not apply to everything, but color adjustments can make your best work even better.</p>

  <p>The original photo of the elf I am working on,<br>has very simple ears, they can certainly benefit from a bit of extra flourish.</p>
  <p>This is called stylization,<br>where you may enlarge the eyes, make the moth smaller, add or remove shine from hair, or even make the eyes glow.</p>
  <p>Elves, vampires, robots, and werewolves can all benefit,<br>from glowing eyes.</p>
  <p>It does not have to be an evil glow,<br>just a magical one.</p>
  <p>Stylization of realistic portraits,<br>is best to be kept down to minimum, a glint in the eye, a glow to the hair.</p>
  <p>But once you cross into he world of fantasy,<br>developing your stylization techniques becomes a superpower.</p>
  <p>The best way to get at stylization ideas,<br>is to look at other people's art in search of the ideas they borrowed and developed.</p>

  <p>As you cross beyond realism,<br>and begin to speak with color and added flourish of stylization.</p>
  <p>You will discover the language of the pose,<br>here you can express defiance, attack, power, by bending the shape of the body.</p>
  <p>You still use photos for reference,<br>you want things to feel right.</p>
  <p>But now take a loooooong time,<br>to pose your models, and to take just the perfect photo that goes well with the face and will agree with hands.</p>
  <p>Yeah, some people will draw a simplified skeleton,<br>but just like with portraits this is not something you start with.</p>
  <p>And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">despite the nonsense art teachers may throw at your feet</a>,<br>using simplified skeletons, may be something, that you might want to consider avoiding.</p>
  <p>Just like you don't want to paint a portrait from memory,<br>you probably don't want your pose to start with a skeleton doodle.</p>
  <p>Some artists may not wish to use a wooden or plastic model,<br>and pose themselves, or ask friends for help with their reference photos.</p>
  <p>In fact those reference photos,<br>may dictate where the painting is going next.</p>
  <p>And here you can easily imagine how a person would be willing to pay upwards of hundreds of dollars,<br>just to own a battling werewolf or armor clad Elf, or battle angel version of themselves.</p>
  <p>The more you build out the scene in a way that your subject loves,<br>the more valuable that work of art will become for them.</p>

  <p>I grew up hearing of a painting so large,<br>that it was said, I could get lost in it.</p>
  <p>When I got a bit older I finally went to visit it,<br>the painting was the room.</p>
  <p>You couldn't walk up to it,<br>as the painting merged with he floor that had real sand and battle artifacts scattered over it.</p>
  <p>Apparently, you couldn't just jump over the railing,<br>and play with he guns, even though they were already on the ground.</p>
  <p>This is the nature of composition,<br>world building, world speaking, world enticing.</p>
  <p>Just like you can't put a relaxed person into a battle painting,<br>you can't just draw any simple background.</p>
  <p>The scene behind your character,<br>must be carefully built.</p>
  <p>If the vampire feels passion,<br>the forest must burn.</p>
  <p>If the werewolves,<br>begin their march, then the night moon must be brighter than the sun.</p>
  <p>If beautiful elves,<br>are dancing, then the world must dance along with-them.</p>
  <p>And if the warriors are preparing for battle,<br>the war hammers and the katanas must weigh upon all the souls.</p>

  <p>Even if all you have is one realistic portrait,<br>the gateway to the other universes, is already within your reach.</p>
  <p>Install Krita, get a pen and tablet, grab a reference photo from reddit gets drawn, stretch it over the entire Krita canvas,<br>set opacity to 50%, and let it serve you as the shape guide, and the source of perfect color.</p>
  <p>May your art begin with Hyperrealism,<br>for there are great universes waiting for you, to open the door.</p>

  "text": "Fantasy worlds create beautiful,\nsometimes scary stories.\nBut there is more to it,\nbecause as you find comfort in creation of realistic portraits.\nYou will surely ponder a new direction,\nsearch for things that can enhance your art.\nAdventures into the worlds of fantasy,\nare one such thing.\nFantasy built on top of realism,\ncreates extremely valuable works of art.\n\nAnd please don't worry, as with portraits,\nthe road towards fantasy is paved with reference images.\nBut here you move beyond head-shots, and even full body photos,\ninto speaking with color, style, pose, and composition.\nDespite what schools try to teach us,\nit is always more responsible to prepare a library of all the reference photos you will need.\nFor example, I! need butterflies to see if perhaps,\nmy elf painting could use a crown simiular to an 1869 work by Sophie Gengembre Anderson[1].\nA work she entitles with a snippet of a poem by Charles Ede:\n\"Take the Fair Face of Woman, and Gently Suspending, With Butterflies, Flowers, and Jewels Attending, Thus Your Fairy is Made of Most Beautiful Things\".\nAnd that is exactly what you need to upgrade your realistic portrait,\nto a fairy version.\n\nArt is a beautiful adventure,\nit has a song that will intertwine with yours.\nIf fantasy worlds call to you,\nthan this is your next step.\nYou will learn fast,\nI barely begun and I already outgrew my first three works.\nMy portfolio is down to just six pieces,\nas if to make room for more fantastic realism.\nMy Hoistu! cat does not belong in my art portfolio as it is too silly,\nstill it will make its way to my Art Book, so that nothing is lost.\n\nThe adventure into the words of fantasy,\nis a thing meant for art.\nAnd here we can directly speak of color, style, posture and composition,\nas enhancing those to their maximums brings fantasy to life.\n\nWe must ask if the original color palette of our reference image,\ncan be made better.\nI am currently working on an Elf,\nand it is worth exploring more skin tones, more glow and fantasy.\nBeyond that, the atmosphere of the world of elves,\ncan lean towards the green like the Matrix, or yellow like Breaking Bread Mexico.\nWe should call it Color Palette Enhancement,\nit does not apply to everything, but color adjustments can make your best work even better.\n\nThe original photo of the elf I am working on,\nhas very simple ears, they can certainly benefit from a bit of extra flourish.\nThis is called stylization,\nwhere you may enlarge the eyes, make the moth smaller, add or remove shine from hair, or even make the eyes glow.\nElves, vampires, robots, and werewolves can all benefit,\nfrom glowing eyes.\nIt does not have to be an evil glow,\njust a magical one.\nStylization of realistic portraits,\nis best to be kept down to minimum, a glint in the eye, a glow to the hair.\nBut once you cross into he world of fantasy,\ndeveloping your stylization techniques becomes a superpower.\nThe best way to get at stylization ideas,\nis to look at other people's art in search of the ideas they borrowed and developed.\n\nAs you cross beyond realism,\nand begin to speak with color and added flourish of stylization.\nYou will discover the language of the pose,\nhere you can express defiance, attack, power, by bending the shape of the body.\nYou still use photos for reference,\nyou want things to feel right.\nBut now take a loooooong time,\nto pose your models, and to take just the perfect photo that goes well with the face and will agree with hands.\nYeah, some people will draw a simplified skeleton,\nbut just like with portraits this is not something you start with.\nAnd despite the nonsense art teachers may throw at your feet[2],\nusing simplified skeletons, may be something, that you might want to consider avoiding.\nJust like you don't want to paint a portrait from memory,\nyou probably don't want your pose to start with a skeleton doodle.\nSome artists may not wish to use a wooden or plastic model,\nand pose themselves, or ask friends for help with their reference photos.\nIn fact those reference photos,\nmay dictate where the painting is going next.\nAnd here you can easily imagine how a person would be willing to pay upwards of hundreds of dollars,\njust to own a battling werewolf or armor clad Elf, or battle angel version of themselves.\nThe more you build out the scene in a way that your subject loves,\nthe more valuable that work of art will become for them.\n\nI grew up hearing of a painting so large,\nthat it was said, I could get lost in it.\nWhen I got a bit older I finally went to visit it,\nthe painting was the room[3].\nYou couldn't walk up to it,\nas the painting merged with he floor that had real sand and battle artifacts scattered over it.\nApparently, you couldn't just jump over the railing,\nand play with he guns, even though they were already on the ground.\nThis is the nature of composition,\nworld building, world speaking, world enticing.\nJust like you can't put a relaxed person into a battle painting,\nyou can't just draw any simple background.\nThe scene behind your character,\nmust be carefully built.\nIf the vampire feels passion,\nthe forest must burn.\nIf the werewolves,\nbegin their march, then the night moon must be brighter than the sun.\nIf beautiful elves,\nare dancing, then the world must dance along with-them.\nAnd if the warriors are preparing for battle,\nthe war hammers and the katanas must weigh upon all the souls.\n\nEven if all you have is one realistic portrait,\nthe gateway to the other universes, is already within your reach.\nInstall Krita, get a pen and tablet, grab a reference photo from reddit gets drawn, stretch it over the entire Krita canvas,\nset opacity to 50%, and let it serve you as the shape guide, and the source of perfect color.\nMay your art begin with Hyperrealism,\nfor there are great universes waiting for you, to open the door.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Gengembre_Anderson\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2uetRVK_Tk",

  <p>There is a rule that is not as popular as it should be,<br>I call it the 45 minute rule!</p>

  <p>Basically, the 45 minute marker,<br>divides adventure from expedition.</p>

  <p>Now, before I carry on,<br>allow me to admit.</p>
  <p>That I was in deed the child,<br>that would eat the tasty sandwiches...</p>
  <p>The moment he quit fidgeting and settled in,<br>in the bus, that didn't even leave the parking lot.</p>

  <p>And let me further clarify,<br>that these were real sandwiches.</p>
  <p>Sometimes they didn't even use butter,<br>but, like, rotisserie chicken thing.</p>
  <p>And it would not always be ham,<br>often it was a large sausage called: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=o%C5%82awska+kie%C5%82basa">Oławska Kiełbasa</a>.</p>
  <p>And sometimes little bits of said chicken,<br>cooked to perfection, of course.</p>
  <p>We are talking here about,<br>high end culinary creations.</p>
  <p>Chicken recipes passed down <em>through generations</em>,<br>and there was always this special spice that accompanied the poor chicken.</p>

  <p>And before I go on,<br>I wan to say that when New York's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agS48ZisZEE">El Blizzardo</a> hit.</p>
  <p>I saw the snow, I was there,<br>people were building igloos and all that.</p>
  <p>But, I wasn't <em>mindful</em> of expeditions and adventures even,<br>and tragically my time during El Blizzardo was merely few days off and then crawling back to school.</p>
  <p>In my defense, I quietly assumed that El Blizardos happen every other year,<br>or so.</p>
  <p>What I am saying is that we need to <em>develop a nose</em> for Expeditions and Adventures,<br>and thankfully it has never been simpler to take photos, and do take a lot of them,</p>
  <p>What I should have done, was to walk,<br>or attempt to tunnel with all the other maniacs across the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
  <p>Perhaps I would have made it to see Dave in person that night,<br>they were apparently not paying enough for people to show up.</p>
  <p>Mostly though I was a Coco fan,<br>goodness knows he needed at least one audience member back then.</p>
  <p>And for once,<br>it actually helped, that I didn't speak a word of English (<em>rimshot</em>).</p>

  <p>Unfunny comedians aside, the lesson was learned,<br>know when an adventure begins, always be ready.</p>
  <p>And know when an adventure becomes an expedition,<br>make sure to take plenty of water, and silly photos.</p>
  <p>These things happen once a decade,<br>and my goodness, each decade will be better than the previous.</p>
  <p>El Blizzardo went down in 1996,<br>by 2006 the end of my first decade, I've had the great pleasure of finishing to learn Engrish, and retiring as a programmer.</p>
  <p>By 2016, the end of my second decade, not only did I finish reading my first thousand books,<br>but I slowly begun discovering, that unbelievably, I had something to say.</p>
  <p>And while it is true that 2026 has not arrived yet,<br>I will have surely cursed the world with the completion of my first Audio Book by then.</p>
  <p>I think it is really important for all of us to create funny and long winded narrations,<br>it is good for the spirit, it works great across time, and it is not even that hard.</p>
  <p>The thing about Audio Books is not that they require extra time,<br>bur rather, that it requires many years, to make a good Audio Book, as many as you can spare.</p>
  <p>And while a good paperback should me be more than a hundred pages,<br>a good and interesting Audio Book, should be 50, or 100, or even 500 hours long.</p>
  <p>As many years as you are willing to spare,<br>and you will never regret it, especially if you manage to share <em>all</em> the wisdom of that particular age.</p>
  <p>All else fails, just tell them this come your final chapter:<br>"Hey, if you can sit through my book - you can sit through anything." - and that counts for something.</p>

  <p>Never miss an expedition, because an expedition comes from almost the same place,<br>that you curiosities do - and I bet you never thought about it that way.</p>
  <p>Be it a great adventure, or a 45 minute <strong>plus</strong> expedition,<br>the moment it comes to a close, you won't just be better for it, you will be <strong>Greater</strong> for it (and I mean the word in a Philosophical sense)</p>
  <p>It is all fun and games,<br>until you find yourself becoming a Greater, and Greater Being.</p>
  <p>And I bet you never thought about this too:<br>"What exactly is the point of an expedition?".</p>
  <p>We are so deeply familiar with the answer to the Expedition question,<br>that it almost sounds circular when you say it: "The point of an expedition is Greatness."</p>
  <p>Even though it may seem like walking to the Supermarket for a change,<br>is no big deal, it is.</p>
  <p>Because it is the time you spend,<br>with the most important thoughts, how lucky you are, how young, or wise, or out of control, or all of the above.</p>

  <p>All that it takes to set off on great adventures,<br>is leaving the car keys at home; and a good pair of walking shoes.</p>
  <p>Look around,<br>You are surrounded by Adventures and Expeditions.</p>

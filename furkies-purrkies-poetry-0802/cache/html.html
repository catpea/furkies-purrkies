  <p>You may already have a computer,<br>but that is not good.</p>
  <p>You need a computer for learning,<br>you can get the pre-assembled $100 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/">Raspberry PI 400</a>.</p>
  <p>There are <a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-400-desktop-computer-kit.html?cid=usd&src=raspberrypi">some extras you can get</a>,<br>and you will need a cheap $70 monitor, I recommend you get two cheap monitors.</p>
  <p>Or you can get the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-4IxW9cgN4">some assembly required 8GB version</a>,<br><a href="https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi/pi-4-kits">Raspberry PI 4</a> (not 400).</p>
  <p>Note to parents: When I was 10 or 12, I got a Commodore 64, that looked similar to the Raspberry PI 400,<br>I wouldn't know how to assemble a Raspberry PI 4, I would need someone else to do it for me.</p>
  <p>This is a slow computer, You Tube takes half a minute to load,<br>but that is very good for learning web design and programming.</p>
  <p>The Raspberry PI will work too slow,<br>when the programs are written wrong.</p>

  <p>This is not a windows computer,<br>windows is a closed source commercial product.</p>
  <p>The money culture propagates through the programmers,<br>and programs that are written for windows often cost too much.</p>
  <p>The money culture, misleads the programmers,<br>to places that bring them nothing.</p>

  <p>The most important program is the terminal,<br>just as soon as you get the computer setup.</p>
  <p>Go to the terminal that you will recognize from hacker scenes in movies,<br>and prepare to write your first program.</p>
  <p>You will join two commands together,<br>that is how you create a new program, by wrapping two commands.</p>

  <p>When you connect commands,<br>you are connecting two boxes with a wire.</p>
  <p>Most commands have a configuration,<br>for example you can configure the echo command to say hello.</p>
  <p>Open up your terminal and say <code>echo hello</code>,<br>and you will see the word hello printed on the screen.</p>
  <p>Now we are going to connect it to another command,<br>to make hello upper case.</p>
  <p>the other command is tr short for translate,<br>it will accept two configuration arguments from you:</p>
  <p>What to convert ... to what, so first you will say the lowercase letters a-z,<br>and then the uppercase letters A-Z.</p>
  <p>Enter in your terminal: <code>echo hello | tr a-z A-Z</code>,<br>and press enter.</p>
  <p>You just sent the data hello from the echo command,<br>through the tr command, which barfed it to the screen, because it wasn't connected to anything else.</p>
  <p>If you want to say hello world, use double quotes,<br>it would work without it, but only because the echo command loves you, and is trying to be cute.</p>
  <p>The convention here is SPACE is a sacred separator of arguments,<br>that is how the terminal command line can understand you.</p>

  <p>Please think of the command line as a graphical program,<br>that has been reduced to text, by a very angry nerd who got tired of clicking a mouse.</p>
  <p>Why should you drag a fancy cute wire between two shiny boxes on your screen,<br>named echo and tr, that have a little drop shadow maybe little flowers.</p>
  <p>When you can just enter echo-hello-tr-az-az on the command line,<br>the command line is a reduction of the user interface.</p>
  <p>It is a user interface,<br>reduced to its lowest terms.</p>

  <p>When you are programming for a while,<br>the mouse kind of gets in the way.</p>
  <p>You just want to keep your hands on your keyboard,<br>so the quickest way to program something is opening up a terminal and typing up a command.</p>

  <p>The Raspberry PI window, that your terminal is in,<br>is for normal users, and all the cats who like mice.</p>
  <p>It can be reduced to a power Grrr interface with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaP7sNCJYV0&t=208s">i3 tiling window manager</a>,<br>but that is something you do later as it would be too overwhelming at first.</p>
  <p>Still, efficiently using i3,<br>is a sign that you are a powerful creator (it can help you get a strange but fun job).</p>
  <p>And you get bonus points,<br>for using a reduced key mechanical keyboard.</p>
  <p>I mention this because years into programming,<br>people often regret not having this muscle memory.</p>
  <p>This is not something you should seriously consider at first,<br>but powerful programmer muscle memory, it is something you need to be aware of.</p>
  <p>It is similar to when a pianist plays the piano,<br>the notes is not something they translate anymore.</p>
  <p>The notes are in their hands,<br>they come automatically.</p>

  <p>The Raspberry PI ships with an option to install,<br>Visual Studio Code.</p>
  <p>I've noticed that people already made copies of it to remove Microsoft proprietary stuff,<br>and get rid of their custom open license.</p>
  <p>Microsoft has enabled Telemetry by default,<br>so you may wish to disable that, on principle.</p>
  <p>VSCode is a very popular editor,<br>but once a true open-source-version fork gains in popularity you should hop onto that.</p>

  <p>Executing your first command, and poking at a proper code editor,<br>in a little laboratory corner of your room is a big deal.</p>
  <p>You don't have to write any programs,<br>just have your code lab ready.</p>

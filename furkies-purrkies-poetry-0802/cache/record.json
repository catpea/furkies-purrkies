  "text": "You may already have a computer,\nbut that is not good.\nYou need a computer for learning,\nyou can get the pre-assembled $100 Raspberry PI 400[1].\nThere are some extras you can get[2],\nand you will need a cheap $70 monitor, I recommend you get two cheap monitors.\nOr you can get the some assembly required 8GB version[3],\nRaspberry PI 4[4] (not 400).\nNote to parents: When I was 10 or 12, I got a Commodore 64, that looked similar to the Raspberry PI 400,\nI wouldn't know how to assemble a Raspberry PI 4, I would need someone else to do it for me.\nThis is a slow computer, You Tube takes half a minute to load,\nbut that is very good for learning web design and programming.\nThe Raspberry PI will work too slow,\nwhen the programs are written wrong.\n\nThis is not a windows computer,\nwindows is a closed source commercial product.\nThe money culture propagates through the programmers,\nand programs that are written for windows often cost too much.\nThe money culture, misleads the programmers,\nto places that bring them nothing.\n\nThis is a Linux based computer,\nit uses the Debian Operating System.\nDebian wraps Linux providing commands,\na proper graphic environment and ability to run all the programs.\n\nThe most important program is the terminal,\njust as soon as you get the computer setup.\nGo to the terminal that you will recognize from hacker scenes in movies,\nand prepare to write your first program.\nYou will join two commands together,\nthat is how you create a new program, by wrapping two commands.\n\nWhen you connect commands,\nyou are connecting two boxes with a wire.\nMost commands have a configuration,\nfor example you can configure the echo command to say hello.\nOpen up your terminal and say echo hello,\nand you will see the word hello printed on the screen.\nNow we are going to connect it to another command,\nto make hello upper case.\nthe other command is tr short for translate,\nit will accept two configuration arguments from you:\nWhat to convert ... to what, so first you will say the lowercase letters a-z,\nand then the uppercase letters A-Z.\nEnter in your terminal: echo hello | tr a-z A-Z,\nand press enter.\nYou just sent the data hello from the echo command,\nthrough the tr command, which barfed it to the screen, because it wasn't connected to anything else.\nIf you want to say hello world, use double quotes,\nit would work without it, but only because the echo command loves you, and is trying to be cute.\nThe convention here is SPACE is a sacred separator of arguments,\nthat is how the terminal command line can understand you.\n\nPlease think of the command line as a graphical program,\nthat has been reduced to text, by a very angry nerd who got tired of clicking a mouse.\nWhy should you drag a fancy cute wire between two shiny boxes on your screen,\nnamed echo and tr, that have a little drop shadow maybe little flowers.\nWhen you can just enter echo-hello-tr-az-az on the command line,\nthe command line is a reduction of the user interface.\nIt is a user interface,\nreduced to its lowest terms.\n\nWhen you are programming for a while,\nthe mouse kind of gets in the way.\nYou just want to keep your hands on your keyboard,\nso the quickest way to program something is opening up a terminal and typing up a command.\n\nThe Raspberry PI window, that your terminal is in,\nis for normal users, and all the cats who like mice.\nIt can be reduced to a power Grrr interface with the i3 tiling window manager[5],\nbut that is something you do later as it would be too overwhelming at first.\nStill, efficiently using i3,\nis a sign that you are a powerful creator (it can help you get a strange but fun job).\nAnd you get bonus points,\nfor using a reduced key mechanical keyboard.\nI mention this because years into programming,\npeople often regret not having this muscle memory.\nThis is not something you should seriously consider at first,\nbut powerful programmer muscle memory, it is something you need to be aware of.\nIt is similar to when a pianist plays the piano,\nthe notes is not something they translate anymore.\nThe notes are in their hands,\nthey come automatically.\n\nThe Raspberry PI ships with an option to install,\nVisual Studio Code.\nI've noticed that people already made copies of it to remove Microsoft proprietary stuff,\nand get rid of their custom open license.\nMicrosoft has enabled Telemetry by default,\nso you may wish to disable that, on principle.\nVSCode is a very popular editor,\nbut once a true open-source-version fork gains in popularity you should hop onto that.\n\nExecuting your first command, and poking at a proper code editor,\nin a little laboratory corner of your room is a big deal.\nYou don't have to write any programs,\njust have your code lab ready.\nAnd when you feel like you want to test out some things,\nInstall Node and create and run your first JavaScript program[6] and take a look at some JavaScript tutorials[7].\n\nFinally, whether or not your laboratory is secret,\nit is always a good idea to practice saying \"Deedee get out of my laboratory![8]\"\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/\n[2]: https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-400-desktop-computer-kit.html?cid=usd&src=raspberrypi\n[3]:

I think to become a writer,
we have to become unafraid.

So that we can write freely,
openly and without critics.

And that requires,
that we set something up to start.

A website for cat people,
who talk about caution and wisdom.

Or a website,
with crazy recipes...

... then stir the pickles, peaches, pears, potato, and a papaya
and serve frozen in an ice cube tray.

And really strange and mysterious stories,
about how the were passed down through the generations.

And all seemingly written,
by different users.

Or an anonymous social network for
politicians, where you write all the comments.

and they exchange,
convincing but stupid ideas.

Like keeping education,
ineffective.

Or coming up with slogans,
to help the recruiters at the mall...

Lie,
more convincingly.

Free Charger,
if you save your money.

One Philosopher
hints to us that all you need is the side of a coin.

From there the story can flourish,
if all you do is describe the city around the coin.

Or perhaps the thoughts,
on the minds of passers by.

---

Another Philosopher indirectly.
teaches us to create characters.

And by creation I mean,
the real deal.

Actual creation where you design a being,
where you become their creator.

Where they wonder about who you are,
where the speak to you.

They may curse you,
as they go through their trials and tribulations.

You have to drive into them,
the traits of people who are meaningful to you.

The voice of someone misunderstood,
that may not mean a good person.

It can be someone who you feel,
deserves a second chance at life.

You can create someone
with the voice of your biggest bully.

And the tragic past,
of someone who deserved better.

---

Becoming a creator,
can be a burden.

---

Another Philosopher,
a cheerful Philosopher.

Taught me,
that all you need is a newspaper.

So as long as,
you purchase that newspaper.

In a place that is far away,
at first it can be few hours away.

But often that place may be,
few countries away.

---

What I think,
if I may.

Is that you have two responsibilities,
as a writer,

Above all, you have to laugh,
and you have to make your readers happy.

So all misery,
goes straight out the window.

And good riddance,
to that.

And second of all,
you have to teach.

And not just,
anything.

But, you have to,
help your readers to wisdom.

---

Donâ€™t lead them,
help them become leaders.

And get out,
of their way.

---

As to the subject,
you have more than the side of a coin.

Just listen,
to the world.

You can hear politicians,
think crazy thoughts.

Often they invent slogans,
that help the recruiter at the mall; lie.

Or disable education,
in hope of reelection.

At least long enough,
to cancel term limits.

---

Growing stories,
out of broken ideas.

Can help the world,
grow wiser.

---

And, if you ever feel,
writing is not for you.

That is because,
you are yet to find your books.

Among other things,
the books you like...

Will have a rhythm,
that agrees with you.

You may need to listen,
to maybe...

One hundred books,
before you find the ones you like.

Aside from their content,
making you wiser.

Their style, will make you want to,
invent your own.

---

You are a writer,
the sooner you take to the pen...

The more precious,
__you__ will witness you chronicles become.

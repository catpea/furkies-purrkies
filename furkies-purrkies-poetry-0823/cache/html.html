  <p>I think to become a writer,<br>we have to become unafraid.</p>
  <p>So that we can write freely,<br>openly and without critics.</p>
  <p>And that requires,<br>that we set something up to start.</p>
  <p>A website for cat people,<br>who talk about caution and wisdom.</p>
  <p>Or a website,<br>with crazy recipes...</p>
  <p>... then stir t he pickles, peaches, pears, potato, and a papaya<br>and serve frozen in an ice cube tray.</p>
  <p>And really strange and mysterious stories,<br>about how the were passed down through the generations.</p>
  <p>And all seemingly written,<br>by different users.</p>
  <p>Or an anonymous social network for<br>politicians, where you write all the comments.</p>
  <p>and they exchange,<br>convincing but stupid ideas.</p>
  <p>Like keeping education,<br>ineffective.</p>
  <p>Or coming up with slogans,<br>to help the recruiters at the mall...</p>
  <p>Lie,<br>more convincingly.</p>
  <p>Free Charger,<br>if you save your money.</p>

  <p>One Philosopher<br>hints to us that all you need is the side of a coin.</p>

  <p>Another Philosopher indirectly.<br>teaches us to create characters.</p>
  <p>And by creation I mean,<br>the real deal.</p>
  <p>Actual creation where you design a being,<br>where you become their creator.</p>
  <p>Where they wonder about who you are,<br>where the speak to you.</p>
  <p>They may curse you,<br>as they go through their trials and tribulations.</p>
  <p>You have to drive into them,<br>the traits of people who are meaningful to you.</p>
  <p>The voice of someone misunderstood,<br>that may not mean a good person.</p>
  <p>It can be someone who you feel,<br>deserves a second chance at life.</p>
  <p>You can create someone<br>with the voice of your biggest bully.</p>

  <p>What I think,<br>if I may.</p>
  <p>Is that you have two responsibilities,<br>as a writer,</p>
  <p>Above all, you have to laugh,<br>and you have to make your readers happy.</p>
  <p>So all misery,<br>goes straight out the window.</p>
  <p>And good riddance,<br>to that.</p>
  <p>And second of all,<br>you have to teach.</p>
  <p>And not just,<br>anything.</p>

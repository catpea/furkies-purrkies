  <p>Event happens when you click a mouse,<br>it is called the click event.</p>
  <p>The event comes with some information,<br>and that information is just named values, like x=5, or user=alice.</p>
  <p>Emitter means that we can emit events,<br>we can say emit alert “Hello!”</p>
  <p>A Listener must be setup,<br>to hear events.</p>
  <p>Some Event Emitter libraries,<br>allow you to create wildcards, so you can hear all or some events.</p>

  <p>And one time I’ve read someone was challenged<br>to create a simple program by their potential employer.</p>
  <p>They used Event Emitter,<br>to create this beautiful web of information.</p>
  <p>But the company,<br>hated it.</p>
  <p>He was supposed to do it the most minimalist way,<br>so that other employees would know what is going on.</p>
  <p>Bare bone minimalism<br>shows that the person understands the technologies.</p>
  <p>And knows how to use them,<br>in a way that others usually use them.</p>
  <p>Instead he invented this whole new abstraction,<br>that meant other programmers needed to learn to understand it.</p>
  <p>So he needed to program their way,<br>so that they could easily read the code.</p>
  <p>During the interview doing things the hard way,<br>shows that a person did not skip learning about them.</p>
  <p>He was so surprised,<br>he asked about it on the internet.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>On the other hand,<br>people invent extra technologies.</p>
  <p>MooTools, jQuery, Backbone,<br>and the more modern React, Vue, Svelte, and helpers like lodash or PouchDB.</p>
  <p>Everyone loves that,<br>as these are real time savers.</p>
  <p>Now I think this person could have,<br>created a time saver.</p>
  <p>I think that company was mad for not replying to him,<br>and just full of brainless yes-people anyway.</p>
  <p>I wouldn't even touch an interview like that,<br>my knowledge is vast and carefully compiled since I was nine.</p>
  <p>I don’t want anybody,<br>to insult me.</p>

  <p>Having said that, this gentleman who failed the interview,<br>picked the correct technology.</p>
  <p>A nice clean EventEmitter is probably the most powerful way,<br>to write real code.</p>
  <p>I f you write your entire application EventEmitter first,<br>it becomes like a dream, it is like thought programming, a digital day dream.</p>
  <p>You may only have the scaffold made out of listeners,<br>some simple if statements, and emitters.</p>
  <p>But oh wow, you can just send a packet down the pipe,<br>and watch it travel thorough he web.</p>

  <p>It gets better, because if you use simple visual programming,<br>or just <a href="https://js.cytoscape.org/">graph visualization</a>, as in graph theory (very simple).</p>
  <p>Then, you can see the web,<br>the event network of your program.</p>
  <p>Unlike classical visual programming,<br>where what you get is what you drag and drop into the canvas.</p>
  <p>Graph theory, graph database, web socket based even communication between clinet and server,<br>and a code generator that will make the EventEmitter code perfect, will all go a long way.</p>
  <p>A graph database has two concepts, one is that of an node, vertex, bag or box,<br>and an edge, or wire, just wire that connects the boxes.</p>
  <p>Both wire and box, have a unique id,<br>so you can use that as a filename or object name or row ID.</p>
  <p>Just let the graph live in RAM,<br>and save only what changes, or save changes to a log, very simple.</p>
  <p>It is all cut up into tiny bits by default,<br>where graph databases are concerned.</p>
  <p>A graph’s circles and lines,<br>are perfect for visualising EventEmitters with their wires and boxes.</p>
  <p>If we allow ourselves to think of a Listener,<br>as a person with a radio.</p>
  <p>We might as well put them next to a pipe,<br>that will transform whatever they send through it.</p>
  <p>So if the Event Listener is a start of a chain of operations,<br>then those operations can be visually represented with more circles.</p>
  <p>A listener is a circle outline, the chain of functions are filled circles,<br>because functions is where the code sits.</p>

  <p>And here we meet our nemesis, the branching if statement,<br>and just as quickly we turn them into just another EventListener with a chain of functions.</p>
  <p>It would be hard to track all the code, for all the different listeners,<br>but since we are visualizing it graphically, that is not a problem.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>As to tracking variables, that is not even an issue,<br>all the variables are listed by just clicking on the listener, the data is in the event.</p>

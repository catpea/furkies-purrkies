    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And one time I’ve read someone was challenged<br>to create a simple program by their potential employer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They used Event Emitter,<br>to create this beautiful web of information.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But the company,<br>hated it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">He was supposed to do it the most minimalist way,<br>so that other employees would know what is going on.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Bare bone minimalism<br>shows that the person understands the technologies.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And knows how to use them,<br>in a way that others usually use them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Instead he invented this whole new abstraction,<br>that meant other programmers needed to learn to understand it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So he needed to program their way,<br>so that they could easily read the code.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">During the interview doing things the hard way,<br>shows that a person did not skip learning about them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">He was so surprised,<br>he asked about it on the internet.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A nice clean EventEmitter is probably the most powerful way,<br>to write real code.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I f you write your entire application EventEmitter first,<br>it becomes like a dream, it is like thought programming, a digital day dream.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You may only have the scaffold made out of listeners,<br>some simple if statements, and emitters.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But oh wow, you can just send a packet down the pipe,<br>and watch it travel thorough he web.</div>

<div class="card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow">
  <div class="section card-body mb-0 my-2">
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It gets better, because if you use simple visual programming,<br>or just <a href="https://js.cytoscape.org/">graph visualization</a>, as in graph theory (very simple).</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then, you can see the web,<br>the event network of your program.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Unlike classical visual programming,<br>where what you get is what you drag and drop into the canvas.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Graph theory, graph database, web socket based even communication between clinet and server,<br>and a code generator that will make the EventEmitter code perfect, will all go a long way.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A graph database has two concepts, one is that of an node, vertex, bag or box,<br>and an edge, or wire, just wire that connects the boxes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Both wire and box, have a unique id,<br>so you can use that as a filename or object name or row ID.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just let the graph live in RAM,<br>and save only what changes, or save changes to a log, very simple.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is all cut up into tiny bits by default,<br>where graph databases are concerned.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A graph’s circles and lines,<br>are perfect for visualising EventEmitters with their wires and boxes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If we allow ourselves to think of a Listener,<br>as a person with a radio.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We might as well put them next to a pipe,<br>that will transform whatever they send through it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So if the Event Listener is a start of a chain of operations,<br>then those operations can be visually represented with more circles.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A listener is a circle outline, the chain of functions are filled circles,<br>because functions is where the code sits.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And here we meet our nemesis, the branching if statement,<br>and just as quickly we turn them into just another EventListener with a chain of functions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It would be hard to track all the code, for all the different listeners,<br>but since we are visualizing it graphically, that is not a problem.</div>

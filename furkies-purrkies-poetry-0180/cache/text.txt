To the question “how far must I go”,
there is but one answer, and it is never to be uttered quietly.
You must feel it and yell it,
yell it because every moment is a precious miracle.
So you yell: Higher!
Because higher is the answer, and it the only answer there ever was.
Higher, because we never know how far we need to go and grow,
so it is just is better, to keep going and never stop, ever, no matter how much you know.
Don’t stop for bullies,
don’t stop for teachers,
don’t stop for the office,
don’t stop for a career,
just fly right by.
Because, the first and foremost is to break out of all limits,
breach, each and every boundary, and rise right on top, over and over, and tip each tipping point.
Every book that makes Wise Beings smile,
read it, read it many times, record the good parts and play them back to sleep.
And then after your first ten or twenty books, or hundred books,
you write your own, and make it known.
And keep moving,
and don’t stop,
because every wall must fall.
That A in class, that GPA in college, that Promotion and Office Window,
all of that has to go.
It is amazing to return to, from the great heights of your mountains,
but for now you go, because you are not a brick in that wall.
Find your limits,
and build your way out.
Our flaw is such, that we don’t notice bad ideas that we are born around,
and if we keep growing into that life we will run aground.
All you need to do, is become a Great Being first,
then you can come back, and if you want it all, then you can have it all back.
...but first you grow, because without growing first, you’ll never know which way to go.

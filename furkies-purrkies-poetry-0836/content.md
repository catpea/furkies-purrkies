An enchanted ring, is a ring that cannot be made by the human hand,
and the kind of a ring that comes with a silly or strange story.

It is about looking incredible,
and breaking all the design rules.

I recommend working with copper, brass, silver and gold,
and waiting a little bit before designing rings that hold stones.

There is no right way to design such a creation,
using standard Blender tools may just be more reliable.

Once you get into Geometry Nodes,
it takes a while to figure out what not to do with them.

There is a way to invent a ring generator,
but it is probably better to focus on making rings.

---

Ring is not just a closed loop,
some rings are open.

And the loop may not always be solid,
it can be, at least in part a rail that holds the stones.

You would need multiple generators of rings,
so this project could get pretty boring.

---

Now having said that,
you really need to enable Extra Objects in Blender.

It us under Under Preferences Add-ons,
just search for extra.

Use a solidify modifier on flat or mathematical shapes,
to give them thickness.

---

All the strange shapes you will find across 3D object generators and libraries,
Photogrammetry and ancient artifacts will make for excellent rings.

And you shouldn't worry is they seem difficult to wear,
an enchanted ring is about fantasy, showing off, and few will wear it daily.

If it wasn't copyrighted, or at least legally questionable,
I would recommend rebuilding the [Dark Souls Rings][1].

Even so,
it is a good source of inspiration.

Elden Ring a new installment in the series does not appear to have rings,
but [Elden Ring Talismans][2] are also very inspirational - good designs.

There is a [textbook of magic that presents 72 demons][3],
along with [72 magical symbols][4].

But I would encourage you to rebuild the symbols,
but they look pretty ugly, like circuit diagrams.

You will need to rebuild them,
just enough to make them recognizable.

Unlike Dark Souls and Elden Ring items,
the symbols were published in 1904.

---

Searching “[britishmuseum ring][5]” in an image search engine,
yields another treasure trove of ideas.

And of course there is the [random artefact collection][6],
yields a collection of ideas that can be easily turned into a ring.

---

It maybe extremely temping to get some basic tools and order a batch of copper rings,
that you customize and set with stones.

But at least try, solid metal first,
this way you can create a “print jewelry on demand online store”.

---

You may wish to consider that large rings, copper or gold,
are not really solid, some seem folded out of a gold sheet which may save on material costs.

And of course, and this is perhaps one of the more interesting challenges,
an enchanted ring shouldn't really look brand new.

But I leave this challenge,
to you.

  <p>An enchanted ring, is a ring that cannot be made by the human hand,<br>and the kind of a ring that comes with a silly or strange story.</p>
  <p>It is about looking incredible,<br>and breaking all the design rules.</p>
  <p>I recommend working with copper, brass, silver and gold,<br>and waiting a little bit before designing rings that hold stones.</p>

  <p>There is no right way to design such a creation,<br>using standard Blender tools may just be more reliable.</p>
  <p>Once you get into Geometry Nodes,<br>it takes a while to figure out what not to do with them.</p>
  <p>There is a way to invent a ring generator,<br>but it is probably better to focus on making rings.</p>

  <p>Ring is not just a closed loop,<br>some rings are open.</p>
  <p>And the loop may not always be solid,<br>it can be, at least in part a rail that holds the stones.</p>
  <p>You would need multiple generators of rings,<br>so this project could get pretty boring.</p>

  <p>Now having said that,<br>you really need to enable Extra Objects in Blender.</p>
  <p>It us under Under Preferences Add-ons,<br>just search for extra.</p>
  <p>Use a solidify modifier on flat or mathematical shapes,<br>to give them thickness.</p>

  <p>All the strange shapes you will find across 3D object generators and libraries,<br>Photogrammetry and ancient artifacts will make for excellent rings.</p>
  <p>And you shouldn't worry is they seem difficult to wear,<br>an enchanted ring is about fantasy, showing off, and few will wear it daily.</p>
  <p>If it wasn't copyrighted, or at least legally questionable,<br>I would recommend rebuilding the <a href="https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Rings">Dark Souls Rings</a>.</p>
  <p>Even so,<br>it is a good source of inspiration.</p>
  <p>Elden Ring a new installment in the series does not appear to have rings,<br>but <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Talismans">Elden Ring Talismans</a> are also very inspirational - good designs.</p>
  <p>There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon#The_Seventy-Two_Demons">textbook of magic that presents 72 demons</a>,<br>along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon#/media/File:72_Goeta_sigils.png">72 magical symbols</a>.</p>
  <p>But I would encourage you to rebuild the symbols,<br>but they look pretty ugly, like circuit diagrams.</p>
  <p>You will need to rebuild them,<br>just enough to make them recognizable.</p>
  <p>Unlike Dark Souls and Elden Ring items,<br>the symbols were published in 1904.</p>

  <p>Searching “<a href="https://lite.qwant.com/?q=britishmuseum+ring&t=images">britishmuseum ring</a>” in an image search engine,<br>yields another treasure trove of ideas.</p>
  <p>And of course there is the <a href="https://www.popular.pics/reddit/subreddits/posts?r=artefactporn&sort=top&t=year">random artefact collection</a>,<br>yields a collection of ideas that can be easily turned into a ring.</p>

  <p>It maybe extremely temping to get some basic tools and order a batch of copper rings,<br>that you customize and set with stones.</p>
  <p>But at least try, solid metal first,<br>this way you can create a “print jewelry on demand online store”.</p>

  <p>You may wish to consider that large rings, copper or gold,<br>are not really solid, some seem folded out of a gold sheet which may save on material costs.</p>
  <p>And of course, and this is perhaps one of the more interesting challenges,<br>an enchanted ring shouldn't really look brand new.</p>
  <p>But I leave this challenge,<br>to you.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">An enchanted ring, is a ring that cannot be made by the human hand,<br>and the kind of a ring that comes with a silly or strange story.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is about looking incredible,<br>and breaking all the design rules.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I recommend working with copper, brass, silver and gold,<br>and waiting a little bit before designing rings that hold stones.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is no right way to design such a creation,<br>using standard Blender tools may just be more reliable.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once you get into Geometry Nodes,<br>it takes a while to figure out what not to do with them.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is a way to invent a ring generator,<br>but it is probably better to focus on making rings.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Ring is not just a closed loop,<br>some rings are open.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the loop may not always be solid,<br>it can be, at least in part a rail that holds the stones.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You would need multiple generators of rings,<br>so this project could get pretty boring.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Now having said that,<br>you really need to enable Extra Objects in Blender.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It us under Under Preferences Add-ons,<br>just search for extra.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Use a solidify modifier on flat or mathematical shapes,<br>to give them thickness.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">All the strange shapes you will find across 3D object generators and libraries,<br>Photogrammetry and ancient artifacts will make for excellent rings.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And you shouldn't worry is they seem difficult to wear,<br>an enchanted ring is about fantasy, showing off, and few will wear it daily.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If it wasn't copyrighted, or at least legally questionable,<br>I would recommend rebuilding the <a href="https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Rings">Dark Souls Rings</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even so,<br>it is a good source of inspiration.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Elden Ring a new installment in the series does not appear to have rings,<br>but <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Talismans">Elden Ring Talismans</a> are also very inspirational - good designs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon#The_Seventy-Two_Demons">textbook of magic that presents 72 demons</a>,<br>along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lesser_Key_of_Solomon#/media/File:72_Goeta_sigils.png">72 magical symbols</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But I would encourage you to rebuild the symbols,<br>but they look pretty ugly, like circuit diagrams.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You will need to rebuild them,<br>just enough to make them recognizable.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Unlike Dark Souls and Elden Ring items,<br>the symbols were published in 1904.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It maybe extremely temping to get some basic tools and order a batch of copper rings,<br>that you customize and set with stones.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But at least try, solid metal first,<br>this way you can create a “print jewelry on demand online store”.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You may wish to consider that large rings, copper or gold,<br>are not really solid, some seem folded out of a gold sheet which may save on material costs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And of course, and this is perhaps one of the more interesting challenges,<br>an enchanted ring shouldn't really look brand new.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But I leave this challenge,<br>to you.</div>

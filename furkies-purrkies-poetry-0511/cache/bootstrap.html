    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">JSON is a file format, it is not really purrfect for the command line,<br>so we will thin it, reduce it simplify with a program called <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">jq reaches into the JSON file format and grabs plain text for us,<br>without the extra curly bracets, quotes, or in this case, commas that delimit the entries and square brackets that represent lists of data.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We will use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6id1Y0YuNk">curl</a>, it is very similar to wget,<br>but it doesn't have that fancy extra stuff for mirroring websites.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And we need a <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters">jq tutorial</a> to give us some hints on how to use it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSn_38gDvzM">sometimes watching a video tutorial is useful too</a>,<br>I found the stuff under "Array/Object Value Iterator: .[]".</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Let us chop off the top then entries from Hacker News,<br>and see if we can quickly get an overview of what is going on in the world.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The command for getting the top of data is head, and to specify how many lines we want we use -n,<br>so our command now looks like this: curl <a href="https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json?print=pretty">https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json?print=pretty</a> | jq '.[]' | head -n 10;</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And here we reuse curl, but the url that we give to curl needs to have that number inserted in there,<br>there are two ways to do this, one is xargs, and the other a while loop.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The while loop is better, it is more readable, it is faster, but I don't like it because it wraps things,<br>my xargs approach, creates a single straight command line.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Unfortunately my line ends up having a command that uses quotes, inside quotes,<br>so there is quote escaping, by means of backslash, and that is something I don't like.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But I must say the proper way to do this, is a single pipe,<br>get the top story numbers, map the numbers to data, and map the data to text so that it looks nice on the black screen.</div>

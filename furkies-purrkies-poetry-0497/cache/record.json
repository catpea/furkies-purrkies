predisposition to listen to Great Beings,\nnot only will the younger generations become wiser because of who you have become, but you will also be able to restore hope in those who lost it.\n\nWisdom will make the world stop and listen,\nthe very definition of wisdom is that it is integrated, and easy to understand.\nThough yours it maybe as vast as space,\nit will forever remain Human, Forever, All Too Human.\nWisdom can be as simple as helping people out of invisible prisons[1],\na lot of the things that are crushing humanity are concepts that we invented and can regain control over.\nBut humanity can't be torn by noise, confusion, religions, politics, borders, hunger, pain,\nit has to begin growing towards wisdom, where it can converge, integrate, unite, combine its countless strengths.\nThe worlds needs Wise and Unstoppable beings,\nto remind its people of the importance of wisdom.\n\nIf you become a Great Being, the world will begin learning from you,\npeople will follow in similar footsteps, both the young and the old, both the angry and the cheerful.\nDon't just lead them, help them to become like you,\nthat is all that the universe will ever ask from you.\n\nIn the end all it will take, is for the younger generations to understand,\nthat becoming Great Beings is their right.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug",

  <p>The world is not ending,<br>it is just not where it should be.</p>
  <p>And while you are correct to think that most people won't care until it is too late,<br>understand that this is because the world has wronged them.</p>
  <p>They are hurt with overwork, fear confusion, poverty, including poverty in their mind,<br>the idea of paid education can't be more twisted.</p>
  <p>Once an institution charges for knowledge,<br>it becomes permanently tarnished, for putting obstacles in Humanity's way.</p>
  <p>And that is not even considering the question of whether or not school can actually teach,<br>cramming, memorizing, passing, graduating, maybe giving a speech.</p>

  <p>A speech which cannot help but to praise the institution in question, and the faculty,<br>the valedictorian can't say anything negative, and still hope to pay off the debt that school put them in.</p>
  <p>It is all too easy to pick an achiever,<br>that feels warmly about their education, but this is a matter of all the graduates displaying more then they could accomplish on their own.</p>
  <p>And this concept of a GPA, that is controlled by the teachers and school,<br>upon which their funding, and prestige depends on.</p>
  <p>If there actually ever was a need for a real graduation,<br>then it would have the <strong>students</strong> present the fruits of their education.</p>
  <p>Things that they have created, or lead, or begun,<br>meaningful, long lasting or permanent things.</p>

  <p>Anyway, you can spot the lie, by just considering whether or education has an end,<br>real education does not last four years, it lasts a lifetime.</p>
  <p>The silent unspoken truths are all too simple, a name brand education gets people accepted into world renowned circles,<br>it is never about the education, it is about the doors that the brand names open.</p>

  <p>But you see, education can't be faked, education is the driving force beneath Greatness,<br>it empowers with knowledge, enlightens with Wisdom, and lists the person up to Greatness.</p>
  <p>In greatness we don't wage wars, we don't steal blue skies from children a world over by flying drones over their heads,<br>In wisdom, in greatness, we ensure a real education decades before the poverty takes hold.</p>
  <p>We are brothers and sisters,<br>we can see into the future.</p>

  <p>That the world is the way it is, today,<br>is proof that representatives are a cheap and feeble tools.</p>
  <p>--</p>
  <p>With real education, in wisdom, knowing the next steps would be beautiful,<br>it would fill all with Hope.</p>
  <p>But in what we have today,<br>people throw themselves into overwork out of desperation.</p>
  <p>They never discover that are meant to become Great Beings,<br>that money is meant to help humanity grow not force it into wage slavery.</p>
  <p>The wiser generations that are yet to come,<br>will be able to declare whether or not schools in our era held us back.</p>
  <p>Few hundred years from now our internet and even private emails will be read in search for answers,<br>they will search for the answer to the question of why?</p>
  <p>Why didn't we repair all the social constructs that are of our own making and invention, and yet hold us back,<br>why didn't we help humanity advance sooner than later.</p>

  <p>Socrates tried to so this,<br>he tried to teach Wisdom to alter the course hos Civilization was on.</p>

  <p>If you choose to become a Great Being,<br>even those who have been hurt by the world, will listen to you.</p>

  <p>Wisdom will make the world stop and listen,<br>the very definition of wisdom is that it is integrated, and easy to understand.</p>
  <p>Though yours it maybe as vast as space,<br>it will forever remain Human, Forever, All Too Human.</p>
  <p>Wisdom can be as simple as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">helping people out of invisible prisons</a>,<br>a lot of the things that are crushing humanity are concepts that we invented and can regain control over.</p>
  <p>But humanity can't be torn by noise, confusion, religions, politics, borders, hunger, pain,<br>it has to begin growing towards wisdom, where it can converge, integrate, unite, combine its countless strengths.</p>
  <p>The worlds needs Wise and Unstoppable beings,<br>to remind its people of the importance of wisdom.</p>

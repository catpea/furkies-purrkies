    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And you need to keep your image in a Photo Editing program like GIMP,<br>where you can have multiple layers, some for outlines, others for highlights.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example, projecting shadows, on a canvas that you already painted to some degree,<br>isn't going to be very useful, as the projected image is dark in-that area.</div>

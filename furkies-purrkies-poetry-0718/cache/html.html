  <p>Art has finally forced me to rest a little while,<br>I still did a quarter of a realistic painting today.</p>
  <p>A realistic continuation of the Lady and Her Dog,<br>but at a much slower pace.</p>
  <p>Using Reference Images Tool,<br>as a tracing and color guide.</p>
  <p>By stretching it over the entire Krita canvas,<br>aka Cat Pea Technique, is an incredible teacher.</p>
  <p>Remember, over it, not next to it,<br>when you set the reference to 1% opacity, your color picker will still grab the correct colors from the reference photo.</p>

  <p>I use a 15 inch by 15 inch 300 dpi canvas,<br>I work zoomed in so far, that I can see pixels.</p>
  <p>It never really feels like tracing,<br>because you are always working with layers.</p>
  <p>In no time, you will break down the nose,<br>into bottom shadows on one layer, and the nose-dome on the top layer.</p>
  <p>You are building up knowledge of the face,<br>without any concern - at all - that you will somehow get stuck.</p>
  <p>Your reference image, will teach and protect you,<br>it will inspire you to create works that would make the younger you pause in disbelief.</p>

  <p>When you are working with a wall projector in a physical world,<br>you are always adjusting things, and shimmy shammying...</p>
  <p>and trying not to get paint on you,<br>in the twilight of your studio, which is to say room or basement.</p>
  <p>On the computer, you get to focus on learning a bit more,<br>and everything you do here, translates perfectly to the real canvas.</p>

  <p>For one, you need your reference images in the physical world too,<br>and you need a huge pane of glass over them.</p>
  <p>That glass surface is where you will need to mix,<br>or at least test your colors.</p>

  <p>Fantasy art, where you paint faces by just following a system you memorized, is great,<br>but realism demands far more, especially when you paint on a real canvas in the physical world.</p>
  <p>You need the colors on a glass pane,<br>and you need shape reference in the form of a projector.</p>
  <p>And you need to keep your image in a Photo Editing program like GIMP,<br>where you can have multiple layers, some for outlines, others for highlights.</p>
  <p>For example, projecting shadows, on a canvas that you already painted to some degree,<br>isn't going to be very useful, as the projected image is dark in-that area.</p>
  <p>You will need to invert the colors,<br>so that the wall projector is emitting light in the area where the shadows go.</p>

  <p>All of this reduced to a much simpler environment,<br>here in the Open Source Krita.</p>
  <p>And,<br>thee simpler your setup...</p>
  <p>the faster,<br>you master.</p>

  <p>But asking which canvas is superior, the real physical one or the virtual computer one,<br>is a silly question - there are no reasonable answers here.</p>
  <p>You learn faster on the computer, and the canvas won't cost you $50.<br>is about all you can say.</p>
  <p>And please remember to purchase an inexpensive $40 dollar Pen and Tablet for your computer,<br>the tip of the pen is a pressure sensor that will allow you to gently paint in semitransparent layers.</p>

  <p>One extremely important lesson, a source of regret for many artists,<br>is not making a time-lapse video of the creation.</p>
  <p>Just get a cheap camera with a time-lapse feature,<br>and put it in the corner somewhere.</p>
  <p>In Krita enable the Reorder Docker,<br>play around with the settings, and hit record, maybe enable automatic recording too.</p>
  <p>I am working to create new more realistic portraits on top of,<br>a lowbrow version that I already published, this will make an interesting five minute move about the transition from surrealism to realism.</p>

  <p>Finally, the hard pursuit of Artistic Realism under Krita,<br>will give you a solid art education in less than three weeks.</p>
  <p>You may end up with as many as ten fine portfolio pieces,<br>merely as part of your self education.</p>
  <p>By tracing under Krita,<br>you instantly become an artist.</p>
  <p>Once you get to the point where you are building scenes from the photographs yo took,<br>and arranging them in GIMP before setting them up as reference under Krita.</p>
  <p>You will discover, and I promise you this,<br>that it is not tracing...</p>
  <p>You will find that what you thought of as tracing,<br>was True Art, all along.</p>

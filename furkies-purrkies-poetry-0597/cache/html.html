  <p>Is it always nice to have all the friends,<br>it depends.</p>
  <p>But you will never regret,<br>advice that you never forget.</p>
  <p>The most powerful advice I ever got,<br>was from biographies that I bought.</p>

  <p>Alex The Super-tramp taught me,<br>that I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwx3RvDWvDM">can't be free on a bended knee</a>.</p>
  <p>J. Maarten Troost showed me that I was right,<br>to ignore friends with a stupid appetite.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Headhunters-on-My-Doorstep-Audiobook/B00E8HJ7KA">Stay away from alcohol and every kind of brew</a>,<br>and he put it smartly too:</p>
  <p>"If you hang around a barbershop long enough, you'll eventually get a haircut".</p>
  <p>A very touching wisdom came from <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Charles-Kuralts-America-Audiobook/B002UZL5BG">Charles Kuralt's book</a>,<br>where instead of giving a homeless lady his groceries, he merely gave her a look.</p>
  <p>His regret has always made me deeply sad,<br>but that I won't make the same mistake makes me glad.</p>

  <p>It just to happens that some of the wisest people we meet,<br>will be in the books we get as a treat.</p>
  <p>Wise advice is never hated,<br>and popular books sell well as they are celebrated.</p>
  <p>Look to bestsellers, the biographies that come up first,<br>are rarely the worst.</p>

  <p>Biographies that humanity finds wise enough,<br>are precious though sometimes can be tough.</p>
  <p>And we will remember these stories as if they were told by a friend,<br>we adopt the wisdom and whatever else we can comprehend.</p>

  <p>There is a lot of books out there,<br>and all you need is a chair.</p>
  <p>If you make some room to listen or read every day,<br>they will replace your shyness with knowing what to say.</p>
  <p>And your words will flow from within,<br>like the pretty melody of a violin.</p>

  <p>As you grow you are sure to revisit your book friends,<br>and see their adventures through an even wiser lens.</p>
  <p>Biographies are special because they help us avoid entire zones,<br>countless troubles and unknowns.</p>
  <p>We can all look up lists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies">Fallacies</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">Biases</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions">Misconceptions</a>,<br>but that is too dry to instantly influence our perceptions.</p>
  <p>A biography comes from the soul and heart,<br>it is an instantly touching piece of art.</p>
  <p>We need a story that was lived through,<br>a story that is human and true.</p>
  <p>And that is what biographies are for,<br>wisdom, foresight, adventure, and more.</p>
  <p>They help us get to wisdom sooner rather than later,<br>and help us become greater.</p>

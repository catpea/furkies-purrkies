Is it always nice to have all the friends,
it depends.
But you will never regret,
advice that you never forget.
The most powerful advice I ever got,
was from biographies that I bought.

Alex The Super-tramp taught me,
that I can't be free on a bended knee[1].
J. Maarten Troost showed me that I was right,
to ignore friends with a stupid appetite.
Stay away from alcohol and every kind of brew[2],
and he put it smartly too:
"If you hang around a barbershop long enough, you'll eventually get a haircut".
A very touching wisdom came from Charles Kuralt's book[3],
where instead of giving a homeless lady his groceries, he merely gave her a look.
His regret has always made me deeply sad,
but that I won't make the same mistake makes me glad.

It just to happens that some of the wisest people we meet,
will be in the books we get as a treat.
Wise advice is never hated,
and popular books sell well as they are celebrated.
Look to bestsellers, the biographies that come up first,
are rarely the worst.

Biographies that humanity finds wise enough,
are precious though sometimes can be tough.
And we will remember these stories as if they were told by a friend,
we adopt the wisdom and whatever else we can comprehend.

There is a lot of books out there,
and all you need is a chair.
If you make some room to listen or read every day,
they will replace your shyness with knowing what to say.
And your words will flow from within,
like the pretty melody of a violin.

As you grow you are sure to revisit your book friends,
and see their adventures through an even wiser lens.
Biographies are special because they help us avoid entire zones,
countless troubles and unknowns.
We can all look up lists of Fallacies[4], Biases[5], and Misconceptions[6],
but that is too dry to instantly influence our perceptions.
A biography comes from the soul and heart,
it is an instantly touching piece of art.
We need a story that was lived through,
a story that is human and true.
And that is what biographies are for,
wisdom, foresight, adventure, and more.
They help us get to wisdom sooner rather than later,
and help us become greater.

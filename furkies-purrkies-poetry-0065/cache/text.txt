Each day we must learn,
and what we've forgotten re-lean.
Our life depends on clarity,
our visions must be sharp.
A lesson learned, begets a wisdom.
Two create a kingdom.
Our might comes from knowledge,
and you can't find that in college.
Life is too short to lean in slices,
leave them to their own devices.
You are a powerful being,
you learn fastest on your own.
As few teachers there are,
so there are but a handful of books.
It will be hard work,
to fill all the notebooks.
But your mind is unique, anyway,
there is no substitute for your own way.
At first it will be gibberish,
at last, they will read it feverish.
You must not be tired,
your mind cannot be stressed.
You must resist what they desired,
tell them you can't be hired.
You are not a dime a dozen,
there is no other like you.
You have to tend to your mind,
all the forgotten lessons remind.
There cannot be anyone like you,
learn to reach your own breakthrough.
Set your self free from the silly sting,
you are not just a little thing.
No retreat, no surrender.
You are a meant to become a Great Being.

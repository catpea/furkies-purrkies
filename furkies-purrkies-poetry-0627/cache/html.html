  <p>I've only tasted knowledge,<br>and I've not heard of a real College.</p>
  <p>I've been to plenty of schools,<br>and better than most I know their tools.</p>
  <p>Bullies, Grades, Punishment, Shame, Threat,<br>and above all, Debt.</p>
  <p>While you remained seated,<br>you have been and lied to, and robbed, and cheated.</p>

  <p>If I may,<br>I know what they say...</p>
  <p>Lesson number one,<br>you are not a Genius little one.</p>
  <p>Lie number two,<br>I will be fairly grading you.</p>
  <p>And insult number three,<br>I am holier than thee.</p>

  <p>It as all a lie,<br>it was a lie they knew your were going to buy.</p>
  <p>They have you the moment you measure your own soul,<br>with grades... they have you whole.</p>

  <p>But you've been a Genius all along,<br>that's why school is wrong.</p>
  <p>Hawking and Einstein were no smarter than you,<br>they just learned more the more they knew.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoUVSHDbAeM">Hawking reversed time in his experiment</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ebQK7evbw">and Einstein was riding a train to his merriment</a>.</p>
  <p>So please tell me where is this Genius that you are not,<br>...Oh yes, you are a lot smarter than you thought.</p>

  <p>I think as long as schools are a dog and pony show,<br>we should think of them as foe.</p>

  <p>And their tests cause harm to books too,<br>as they split them in two.</p>
  <p>It maybe that what you learn of a book in school,<br>come graduation, you will forget as a rule.</p>
  <p>I think it is the norm,<br>that we are unable to read until our first camping storm.</p>
  <p>I remember a thunder so vile that the ancient dune shook,<br>and I remember reacting out for my book.</p>
  <p>Robinson Crusoe,<br>by Daniel Defoe.</p>
  <p>A copy I found at the Ludington antique store,<br>that I hang on to thorough the storm's roar.</p>
  <p>I've listened to hundreds of books before, and hundreds after,<br>but until then I could not imagine Robinson Crusoe's laughter.</p>
  <p>When you read a book in school, or for school,<br>they are truing it against you as another tool.</p>
  <p>As you can't have the experience needed to understand,<br>they are forcing you to pretend.</p>
  <p>That is what a dog an pony show is like,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEnnvZbYek">they just cannot help but to think you are all alike</a>.</p>

  <p>So, "Can you connect with a book without adventure?"<br>as far as I am willing to venture... Probably not.</p>
  <p>You will only truly understand to what your most powerful book alludes,<br>if the book is the only other universe in the woods.</p>
  <p>Few hundred books after that, without fanfare or surprise,<br>you just ... become wise.</p>

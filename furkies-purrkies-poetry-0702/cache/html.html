  <p>Mona Lisa is a great teacher,<br>the portrait is very simple and friendly.</p>
  <p>Leonardo does a great job showing us,<br>the essentials without sacrificing beauty.</p>
  <p>The more time you spend with Mona,<br>the more inviting copying her will seem.</p>

  <p>As the saying goes,<br>eyes are windows to the soul.</p>
  <p>And that should be the first thing you learn,<br>Mona's eyes are a dream to learn from.</p>
  <p>But also an invitation,<br>to more complex arrangements.</p>
  <p>Today those can be found by searching for,<br>"<a href="https://www.qwant.com/?client=opensearch&q=eye+painting+tutorial&t=images">eye painting tutorial</a>" on an image search engine.</p>
  <p>This is one of the rare few cases,<br>where a video tutorial <strong>may not</strong> be better.</p>
  <p>A still image that shows all the steps,<br>gives you more time to master the details.</p>

  <p>While it is tempting to draw the eyes,<br>by just drawing until they are done.</p>
  <p>It is faster and more reliable,<br>to create a little system of four or eight steps.</p>
  <p>In most cases you probably won't need the extra detail,<br>and you maybe able to skip some steps.</p>
  <p>But be mindful of your portfolio,<br>the extra details make for a wonderful presentation of your abilities.</p>

  <p>Even though Mona Lisa is magically simple,<br>all the details are still there, and you decide how far you want to go.</p>
  <p>Beyond that,<br>you can change the style of eyes.</p>
  <p>I like Pop Surrealism so I make my bigger,<br>and more colorful.</p>

  <p>If you are using Krita hit the "M" key from time to time,<br>to see a mirrored version of your painting.</p>
  <p>Our eyes fill in blanks,<br>it is really good to see the portrait from a different side.</p>
  <p>Take good care of your layers, name them well,<br>and always keep the ones you are not using locked, at least at first.</p>
  <p>Try to change hue of your reference image to a more skin-like tone,<br>there is no end to the lessons she can teach.</p>

  <p>It is OK not to like computers,<br>and paint on canvas or wooden panels.</p>
  <p>But you should still try learning Krita, or GIMP,<br>and take all the time and tutorials in the world.</p>

  <p>Once you set your first painting as your phone background,<br>everything will change.</p>
  <p>You will have no doubt about your artistic abilities,<br>and what art is for.</p>
  <p>Once you get to your first exhibition,<br>be sure to print out many strikes, key-chains, posters, and paint some shoes as well.</p>
  <p>And Art is a kind of class,<br>in which you create your own style, rather than just buying copy at the store.</p>
  <p>By subtle analogy to art,<br>we learn to create all kinds of other things.</p>
  <p>And we discover that there are no limits to what we can learn on our own,<br>so as long as it is interesting to us.</p>

  <p>A season of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Inspector Gadget with closed captions,<br>and I started to kind of almost understand what everyone was saying.</p>
  <p>The first and foremost if for our ears alone,<br>to find the divisions between words in the spoken language.</p>
  <p>Exposure to the language shows the divisions,<br>cartoons especially bring context to what will soon become meaningful words.</p>
  <p>The words that repeat the most are the glue,<br>then after that comes the meat which relies on the context of the scene being watched.</p>
  <p>And then you go, move, grab your parents, or kids, get a ticket,<br>and go.</p>
  <p>Word divisions and frequently used words is all it takes,<br>the next step is listening to news, looking over newspapers, and telling time.</p>
  <p>You have to work hard at using the correct words,<br>if the person asking is nice, and you work hard, you may get a hug if you get it right.</p>

  <p>My watch was showing seventeen or so,<br>and I wasn't sure how to say it, or if I should say five, and if I should add PM.</p>
  <p>The person obviously knew it was the afternoon,<br>or did they?</p>
  <p>If I said seventeen,<br>this question wouldn't come up - but now it did.</p>
  <p>And as it did,<br>I forgot the other words that I may need.</p>
  <p>Do I say Seventeen, "Ohh eight",<br>or zero eight.</p>
  <p>And where do I put the PM,<br>after five where it belongs, or after minutes, which is weird.</p>
  <p>And do I I just say the numbers?</p>
  <p>Seventeen Ohh, Eight Pee Em,<br>No, Five PM, Ohh Eight.</p>

  <p>"Let me look at your watch",<br>at which point I remembered that there were gangs and murders in New York subways.</p>
  <p>Or were the gangs just in the 80's?<br>or just the movies?</p>
  <p>I mumbled something,<br>and went away, leaving the poor person stranded in time, possibly in a murderous mood.</p>
  <p>I wasn't scared of being murdered,<br>as I was so lost that there was no way in hell I could make it back home anyway.</p>
  <p>I literally just moments ago traveled above ground,<br>in a freaking New York subway, I had no idea where I was.</p>

  <p>I had my micro-cassette recorder with me,<br>I cleverly recorded all the station names that I was going to pass, so that I didn't even need to look at the map.</p>
  <p>Except that my pronunciation was so different,<br>from the conductors PRONUNCIATION, I only somewhat recognized every third station...</p>
  <p>...and I couldn't really be sure if it is the same name,<br>as it only sounded a little similar.</p>

  <p>I figured I should just go to Manhattan,<br>to a station that I know, and then go back again, but this time on the right subway.</p>
  <p>It worked like a charm,<br>I made it back to Greenpoint hours late.</p>
  <p>And I got really excited, and counted off a dollar twenty five for a slice of real American pizza,<br>... "it is called a quarter" - I murmured while going though my pocket.</p>
  <p>Then I stopped... is twenty five cents - the coin - a quarter,<br>or is it that two tens and a five make a quarter of a dollar, which is also called a quarter for short.</p>
  <p>Then I stared at the coins,<br>it just blew my mind that five cents in America - my America - five cents is much bigger than ten cents - why do this? why?</p>

  <p>I put dollar twenty five, on the cool metal counter in the pizza place,<br>and I knew they knew that meant a slice - so I didn't have to say anything...</p>
  <p>I sprinkled paprika on it,<br>I was an American, and the pizza person thought that too.</p>
  <p>I made a U-shape of the crust like in the movies, and took a bite,<br>my goodness, my goodness, my goodness...</p>
  <p>To this day, though I forget in the morning,<br>I feel, I know, I still dream of that new taste of pizza with mozzarella cheese.</p>
  <p>And the slice was so big - it was hard to hold - and so flat,<br>and that paprika, that burned, it burned, it was the real deal.</p>
  <p>"Spicy", I said very quietly, repeating it couple more times,<br>my aunt just taught me to use the word spicy when the taste is hot.</p>
  <p>On my way out the magically smelling pizza place,<br>without needing to conjure up courage, I quietly said.</p>
  <p>Tenkju.</p>

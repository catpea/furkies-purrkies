    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A season of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Inspector Gadget with closed captions,<br>and I started to kind of almost understand what everyone was saying.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The first and foremost if for our ears alone,<br>to find the divisions between words in the spoken language.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Exposure to the language shows the divisions,<br>cartoons especially bring context to what will soon become meaningful words.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The words that repeat the most are the glue,<br>then after that comes the meat which relies on the context of the scene being watched.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then you go, move, grab your parents, or kids, get a ticket,<br>and go.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Word divisions and frequently used words is all it takes,<br>the next step is listening to news, looking over newspapers, and telling time.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You have to work hard at using the correct words,<br>if the person asking is nice, and you work hard, you may get a hug if you get it right.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Do I say Seventeen, "Ohh eight",<br>or zero eight.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And where do I put the PM,<br>after five where it belongs, or after minutes, which is weird.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I got really excited, and counted off a dollar twenty five for a slice of real American pizza,<br>... "it is called a quarter" - I murmured while going though my pocket.</div>

  "text": "Just because the world is being tardy,\nit does not mean you should be too.\nIn deed, if you fail to slowly make haste,\nthen the world will become darker for it.\nEvery Human must shine,\nwith Enlightenment.\n\nI know it is hard to accept\nthat schools may not be working.\nWe all have so little,\nand now even more even rugs are pulled from beneath our feet.\nThere is other stuff too,\nfrom bad parenting to mutually assured destruction.\nI am sorry, if you are looking for answers,\nthe best answers any of them will ever give you is: \"How were we supposed to know?\"\n\nA solid foundation in reality is a good start in life,\nsometimes we don't figure things out until it is too late.\nI know this poem caught you early,\nyou have a long time to ponder all this.\nAnd that too is a good start,\na proper Gentlelady or Gentleman questions everything, and takes nothing for granted.\n\nI hope you are still in Middle School or High School,\nand you get to walk to your desk, with a heavy step.\nSlouch, perk up your ears like a Lion,\nand take the whole situation apart.\nThe kids in the back figured it out already,\nbut that is as far as they got, they need more answers.\nThey need you!\nthe leader.\n\nMaybe you can try thinking about debates,\nlearning from the way Great Beings argue the pretenders or the uneducated.\nYou are already given reasons,\nnow you need to find the truth.\nIt is never too early,\nto begin to question everything.\n\nOne of the smallest arguments we are given, is the argument for mathematics,\nwell, it used to be given, it was that we aren't always going to have a calculator on hand.\nThough it is cute to say that we have smart phones with calculators that have advanced mode,\nthere is a darker side to it.\nMathematics is not enough,\nwe need Programming, and we need to be Shell Literate as well.\nVapid and Insipid Mathematics poisoned the beauty of Science,\nmemorization of formulas obscured the simpler beauty beneath.\n\nMemorization is another problem,\nlook how carefully you are nudged to abandon reason and understanding in favor of memorization.\nThe guillotine of failing a class because you tried to learn everything,\ninstead of passing with a straight A+ for merely cramming for the test - DOES chop your head off.\nLook how proud your teacher is, that disingenuous show of teeth,\nup for another raise, sold you for a paycheck and on some simple memes that you can get from a calendar.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons given to you,\nis that you need a Diploma to get a Job.\nI would like you to consider, that perhaps a real diploma,\nis one that a University goes out of their way to give; you for your Great Achievements.\nThe diploma you receive at the end of your stay in school,\nwhile it grants you access to higher institutions and more advanced jobs...\n...it will not prevent those jobs from endangering or sacrificing you for profit,\nthe best lies are the ones that others maneuver you into believing, choices you would never make without their poison.\n\nYour life, does not compare to other lives, no matter how precious or numerous,\nthere is no Life Arithmetic.\nThe closest you can get to a formula is this wonderful contradiction:\nEach life is more important than the other.\nIf someone ever asks you to do something for the greater good, you are not sacrifice,\nyou quit your job or await your dishonorable discharge, and begin your search for Enlightenment and Wisdom, onward to becoming a Great Being.\n\nIf the best job you can possibly get, holds some measure of risk,\nthen you are going to need to try harder.\nIn case you are wondering,\n- I care, and you can't undo that.\nThe harder, or the less worn path,\nis that of becoming an Independent Inventor and Entrepreneur.\nAnd you are not going to be the first or only one,\nfind the others, find a couple of co-founders, learn from your Noble Failures as well as Triumphant Successes.\n\nSo when someone says \"Diploma\",\nyou reply; \"Check Your Premise\", to quote an old friend.\nWhen they say calculator,\nyou say: \"Help me with programming not memorizing formulas.\"\nWhen they box you in to memorize,\nyou get the others to drop the class, because you need a real education, one that helps you to wisdom and greatness.\n\nWhile governments are smart enough to encourage learning,\nas evidenced by mandatory education, they are not smart enough to tell a real education from a fake one.\nI suspect the intelligence of governments is dictated purely by the voters,\nin that wise people will not vote in uneducated representatives.\nBut you see the small catch-22 or egg and chicken problem,\na government can't easily become intelligent enough to encourage real education, without majority of voters being educated for real.\nThe way to do boot the process and hopefully sustain it,\nis to mirror the educational paths of pioneers and founders, in a short: Self Education.\n\nSelf education is not that outrageous,\nthat is what real schools are supposed to encourage you to do, without any interference.\nAnd let me underline that interference will destroy self education,\ngrades, cookie cutter curricula, the threat of repeating classes or even semesters can destroy a beautiful and delicate mind.\nSelf education is like learning to walk, except this time you learn to move in the Universe,\nand instead of getting your feet to move quite right, you are trying to find the audio books that somewhat fit what you already know.\n\nFinally on a related subject, it hurts me to say it, but \"Free College\" is not quite right,\nit should be \"Free Real and Effective Education that Shows Real Results\"\nCompare that to the an Important Vaccine, we don't need a mere Free Shot of Something spelled out with weasel words,\nwe need a real and effective vaccine that shows real results across millions of participants.\nYou should not allow yourself to think of College or University as something that gets you a good job,\na good job is nothing, the dumbest of liars can get you fired if you get in their way.\nThe thing you must look for is Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness,\nas that opens all the gateways ahead of you; but more importantly that path is most worthy of you, it is the most human and healthiest of paths.\n\nAll you need to start is a small bowl of ice cream, an electric blanket, a fine pillow, a comfy bed,\nand a narrated book by Carl Sagan, or Neil deGrasse Tyson, or Bill Bryson.\nAnd then as you get going, and maybe take to liking new titles from best-seller lists and new authors you have never heard of,\nfind a a small, perhaps, pocket sized, well respected book on Bush Craft, and start getting ready for your first tiny venture into the Wild by buying a backpack and a tent...\nYou will need a pair of cut proof gloves, a 16\" Bowie knife (don't do 14\"), get high quality Damascus, Stag Horn Handle, fine leather sheath, full tang, obviously...\nand a second actually useful Bush Craft Knife, and then splurge on a sharp fordable hand saw you can bring along to all adventures, and get an audio book, and fire going as everyone else is still hacking away.\n\nAs you read more and more,\nand things start making sense, as you slowly and independently begin forming an accurate view of the world.\nBring a cheerful friend, or your mum, to a near by state park,\none with a fine beach and a tidy nick-knack store that also doubles as a hot dog stand and perhaps serves a fine and spicy vegetarian alternative.\nLater on, grab couple of lovely and trusting friends,\nfool enough to try to through-hike the Applachin Trail with you in one go from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.\nThough I highly recommend section hiking at first,\nand also, please, please, visit Henry at Walden Pond each time you climb Katahdin.\n\nYou know, it is hard to miss the fact that a tent in bear country makes for a fine dorm room,\nand that each white blaze you meet on the AT, doubles as an A+ that no teacher could possibly give you.\nAnd that each time you make it up Katahdin with a hundred new books on your mind,\nyou do graduate ever higher.\nI think both Henry and the Mountain grant you some of their height\n- I know for certain without a doubt; and I know you can feel it too: You are meant to become a Great Being.",

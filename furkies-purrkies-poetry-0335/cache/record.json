  "text": "Melodies should be composed by ear,\nwherever you start, wherever you are, it is always about finding the next note.\nYou should use a violin to make the sound,\nthere is nothing more beautiful sounding than a lovely violin.\nAnd just keep going until you make it till the end,\nmake a whole song out of just the melody, and you will find what ever it is that you are looking for.\n\nBefore we begin composing our little melodies,\nI want to introduce you to the most beautiful song ever composed.\nAnd the greatest, and most magnificent story ever told,\nand the story told is different for all of us.\nThe song is named, Capriccio Italien[1],\nand composed by Pyotr Tchaikovsky in 1880.\nI think it contains all the secrets of music,\nit is a wonderful masterpiece to learn from about instrument composition.\n\nNow, let us return to the task at hand and make a melody together,\nsomething with long notes and positive directions.\nSomething non too cheerful,\nand non too sad.\nThe way I usually do this is by meowing first,\nand then following it up with an instrument like this:\n* initial call *\n\nDon't stop, when you find something that you like,\nkeep going.\nLet us add a second part,\nsomething more uplifting.\nBefore you add,\nyou have to listen to what you have thus far, and then add something that makes it better.\n* a small extension *\n\nEverybody always teachers melody making to be about asking questions,\nand making answers.\nBut we can do a lot better than that,\nin the third part of our melody we will call out to the universe out of loneliness.\nIt is not a sad call,\nit is just a way to remind all the stars that we are here.\nHere is how you speak to the universe:\n* an expression of feelings *\n\nAnd of course,\nour listeners will now expect an answer.\nNow, of course, the universe has it's own voice,\nthis does not mean that you abandon the violin, no, no, no, no.\nIt just means that in this moment in your melody,\nyou will have to speak for the stars.\nSure, you may not agree with the way I think that stars speak,\nbut since they are tiny little plops in the sky that are always all too far to get to.\nSo, to me they make a plop sound - please don't laugh,\nand a music box - that in my mind is associated with going to sleep - is a neat interpretation of that.\n* the universe speaks back *\n\nAnd now we add a second violin,\none that is more distant.\nWhatever the stars of the universe say,\nthe make the new voice respond.\nI add distance by increasing the reverb and tail of the notes,\nand I make it different from the voice asking the question, by giving it a different tempo.\n* the friendly response *\n\nHere is our little melody in full,\nfirst I will play my meows, and then the instruments.\n* full song plays *\n\nBoth of these versions are available for download as a free phone ring or a terrible alarm.\nViolin Phone Ring or Alarm[2]\nVoice Phone Ring or Alarm[3]\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyy0p90GO2w\n[2]: /audio/violin-0335.mp3\n[3]: /audio/voice-0335.mp3",

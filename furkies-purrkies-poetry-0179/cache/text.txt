It rained today, but was also my jogging day,
so went about it in a warrior's way.
I looked out the window and it was entirely too dark,
I said, "I hope I wont have to hide under a tree in some park."
As I made it to Ford Road it didn't seem that bad,
and then I felt the first three drops hit my head.

I decided to keep going as a proper health nut should,
and a quarter way through, I got soaked pretty good.
Just when I thought the clouds parted,
there was a grumble and the rain really started.
It rained heavy, but it didn't last very long,
I ran cheerfully feeling Mighty and Strong.

My biggest problem were the geese,
where I come from it is a fierce creature that knows no peace.
When I was a child they chased me and would often hiss,
but the ones by the Mall seem to be loving and full of bliss.
I was a beautiful day, without a doubt,
and, as the afternoon unfolded the sun came out.

It brings luck, cheer, and wisdom,
it is a tiny and inexpensive to mass produce audio player.

It just needs a single button, skip,
it constantly plays in shuffle mode.

The international model is easy to power with a range of batteries,
and comes with ear-buds.

Hardware is the neatest representation of the project,
the core is just a few thousand wise and educational poems.

Each poem is about ten or fifteen minutes,
almost always read by a young person as that is the most trustworthy voice.

The poems are designed to bring Humanity together,
they are crafted to undo the damage caused by indoctrination, cult, and propaganda.

---

To many they will deliver freedom,
they will help people rise from overwork, poverty, bondage.

They will remind the listener that we are one family,
an that we are only torn by mistakes propagated by lack of real education.

---

The poems are crafted to ignite Love of Wisdom,
ans thus induce Convergence on Wisdom.

The girls will speak broadly and simply,
to people who are tired of lies.

The poems will reach all the continents, nations, and tribes,
they will be heard prisoners, warriors, politicians, leaders and every young person everywhere.

---

The poems will help people sleep at night,
and bring a new bit of wisdom each morning.

The poems will unite the world,
with the common goals of Peace and Wisdom.

---

Some of the poems will explain a new kind of international bank,
that does not keep track of debt only a daily spending limit.

It presents a free card that sets every Human Being on Planet Earth,
free, free from hunger, homelessness, crime, wage slavery, and poverty.

---

Other poems will teach drawing, painting, music composition,
computation and programming, philosophy and leadership.

And they will call to all the Daughters of Philosophy: The Sciences,
they will explain the moon, the sun, stars, climate, chemistry, electricity, psychology and neurology.

For many the poems will become the first stepping stone,
towards becoming a Scientist.

---

The poems will carry the message of Genius,
that we are all extremely smart.

It is just that we each have a different path towards understanding,
and we learn best only when something is meaningful to us.

Grades will no longer hurt students into thinking,
they are not good enough, or not smart enough.

---

A few thousand poems in public domain that are found worthy of translation into every language,
goes a long way to change the world.

They will bring good dreams, they will explain everything,
they will bring Humanity Together.

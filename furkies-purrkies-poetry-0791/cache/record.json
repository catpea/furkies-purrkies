  "text": "We are all artists, and powerful learners,\nit takes hours to paint realistic things.\nAnd it almost takes no effort,\nto navigate complex concepts as if they were a city.\n\nTake a selfie,\nor a photo of a friend.\nAnd just use a projector in traditional art,\nor a transparent layer in digital art.\nThen quickly find a Coffee Shop or a Gallery,\nto display you art in.\nAnd there you go,\nthat is all the proof you need.\n\nOnce you relax,\nyou will want to paint magical things.\nGlowing eyes, or swords,\nshiny armor and stormy vistas.\nThe distance between a realistic portrait,\nand the much easier bonuses and effects...\nIs so short and fun,\nthat we probably shouldn't measure it in terms of distance.\n\nThere are problems that can artificially,\nbe put in front of you.\nBut that does not mean you are not an artist,\nthat just means you got tricked.\n\nFor example, teachers forcing you to practice mixing oil paint,\nbased on color theory, until art bores you is a trick.\nThey just want to put food on their table,\nand they want easy to display proof they are teaching.\nSo they will say \"they know color theory now\",\nbut that is a fake education.\nIf your teacher wanted to teach yo art for real,\nthey would just show you to use the damn wall projector in your class room.\nBut they fear that, because that will make you ask real questions,\nlike \"How to make gold seem heavier\", \"How to make the clouds seem heavy with rain\".\nThey don't know, they only know how to fake an education,\nhow to quack like the other ducks.\nThey are not entirely conscious that they are cheating,\nsame way that you ignore the fact that grades are bull$hit.\nYou know grades don't work, but you tolerate them,\nlike they tolerate selling yo out.\n\nBullies are somewhat similar,\nyou know they are the bad guys.\nBut you are still allowing them,\nto hold influence over you.\nEven though they are sick and crazy, and about to fall apart,\nyou are still allowing their laughter to get to you.\n\nOther artists pose a great danger too,\na lot of them will tell you that what you are doing is not art.\nWhile, creating more than slightly crooked portraits,\nand not learning at all.\nTeachers, bullies, jealous artists, crappy people and poverty,\nwill all try to take art away from you.\nPoverty does it in a pretty vile way too,\nthe myth of the starving artist the beginning of it.\n\nYour art education is fake, your art teacher is fake,\nyou will be told you won't find a job as an artist by the counselor and parents.\nAnd then some seriously creepy ghouls, GHOULS,\nset a trap for you.\nCheck this out, while everyone is pretending college is great,\nignoring fake teachers, drug use, and so called sports bars.\nA bunch of ghouls will give you $100,000 under one condition,\nyou have to pay it even if you file for bankruptcy.\nBut wait there is more, you will get a job,\nthat will not index your raise to inflation.\nEach year as prices go up,\nyou will get a raise that is only a fraction of the yearly inflation.\nYou will have to say thank you,\nfor getting paid less each year.\n\nI should add war and climate,\nworld government are incapable of advancing the world.\nThey can only fund war, they can't fund real education,\nthey don't even know education is fake.\nAnd of course, they don't know that a Global School,\nwould help the world converge in Wisdom on Peace.\nNone of the rules or laws they crated,\nare capable to prevent a mass extinction event.\nThe laws they crafted,\ncan only deal with consequences, not prevention.\n\nArt is a way to train our minds to reject fake or ineffective things,\nthat lead us in circles, or downright nowhere.\nJust the taste of starting int he beginning, all by your lonesome,\nand then reaching Hyperrealism and beyond.\nWill help you reject inauthenticity,\nand begin seeking knowledge be it adventure, narrated books, or documentaries.\nEven before exhibiting your art,\nyou will get angry at having been tricked by teachers, politicians, and common culture.\nOnce you hold a complete creation in your hand,\nyou will demand the same from school, work and politics.\nAll the while, and with the now necessary certainty\nprotecting your brilliance.\nThe brilliance that is in all of us,\nand all to often taken away or traded for something less before we notice.\n\nTake to art,\nand use it as a ladder.\nTake to narrated books,\nand inherit the many lifetimes of your favorite authors.\nFrom broad knowledge comes wisdom,\nand wisdom will help you grow, all the way up.\nUntil you become a great being,\nand all the many others too.\nThat is the recipe,\nfor the advancement of Human Kind.",

  <p>We are all artists, and powerful learners,<br>it takes hours to paint realistic things.</p>
  <p>And it almost takes no effort,<br>to navigate complex concepts as if they were a city.</p>

  <p>Take a selfie,<br>or a photo of a friend.</p>
  <p>And just use a projector in traditional art,<br>or a transparent layer in digital art.</p>
  <p>Then quickly find a Coffee Shop or a Gallery,<br>to display you art in.</p>
  <p>And there you go,<br>that is all the proof you need.</p>

  <p>Once you relax,<br>you will want to paint magical things.</p>
  <p>Glowing eyes, or swords,<br>shiny armor and stormy vistas.</p>
  <p>The distance between a realistic portrait,<br>and the much easier bonuses and effects...</p>
  <p>Is so short and fun,<br>that we probably shouldn't measure it in terms of distance.</p>

  <p>There are problems that can artificially,<br>be put in front of you.</p>

  <p>For example, teachers forcing you to practice mixing oil paint,<br>based on color theory, until art bores you is a trick.</p>
  <p>They just want to put food on their table,<br>and they want easy to display proof they are teaching.</p>
  <p>So they will say "they know color theory now",<br>but that is a fake education.</p>
  <p>If your teacher wanted to teach yo art for real,<br>they would just show you to use the damn wall projector in your class room.</p>
  <p>But they fear that, because that will make you ask real questions,<br>like "How to make gold seem heavier", "How to make the clouds seem heavy with rain".</p>
  <p>They don't know, they only know how to fake an education,<br>how to quack like the other ducks.</p>
  <p>They are not entirely conscious that they are cheating,<br>same way that you ignore the fact that grades are bull$hit.</p>
  <p>You know grades don't work, but you tolerate them,<br>like they tolerate selling yo out.</p>

  <p>Bullies are somewhat similar,<br>you know they are the bad guys.</p>
  <p>But you are still allowing them,<br>to hold influence over you.</p>
  <p>Even though they are sick and crazy, and about to fall apart,<br>you are still allowing their laughter to get to you.</p>

  <p>Other artists pose a great danger too,<br>a lot of them will tell you that what you are doing is not art.</p>
  <p>While, creating more than slightly crooked portraits,<br>and not learning at all.</p>
  <p>Teachers, bullies, jealous artists, crappy people and poverty,<br>will all try to take art away from you.</p>
  <p>Poverty does it in a pretty vile way too,<br>the myth of the starving artist the beginning of it.</p>

  <p>Your art education is fake, your art teacher is fake,<br>you will be told you won't find a job as an artist by the counselor <strong>and</strong> parents.</p>
  <p>And then some seriously creepy ghouls, GHOULS,<br>set a trap for you.</p>
  <p>Check this out, while everyone is pretending college is great,<br>ignoring fake teachers, drug use, and so called sports bars.</p>
  <p>A bunch of ghouls will give you $100,000 under one condition,<br>you have to pay it even if you file for bankruptcy.</p>
  <p>But wait there is more, you will get a job,<br>that will not index your raise to inflation.</p>
  <p>Each year as prices go up,<br>you will get a raise that is only a fraction of the yearly inflation.</p>
  <p>You will have to say thank you,<br>for getting paid less each year.</p>

  <p>I should add war and climate,<br>world government are incapable of advancing the world.</p>
  <p>They can only fund war, they can't fund real education,<br>they don't even know education is fake.</p>
  <p>And of course, they don't know that a Global School,<br>would help the world converge in Wisdom on Peace.</p>
  <p>None of the rules or laws they crated,<br>are capable to prevent a mass extinction event.</p>
  <p>The laws they crafted,<br>can only deal with consequences, not prevention.</p>

  <p>Art is a way to train our minds to reject fake or ineffective things,<br>that lead us in circles, or downright nowhere.</p>
  <p>Just the taste of starting int he beginning, all by your lonesome,<br>and then reaching Hyperrealism and beyond.</p>
  <p>Will help you reject inauthenticity,<br>and begin seeking knowledge be it adventure, narrated books, or documentaries.</p>
  <p>Even before exhibiting your art,<br>you will get angry at having been tricked by teachers, politicians, and common culture.</p>
  <p>Once you hold a complete creation in your hand,<br>you will demand the same from school, work and politics.</p>
  <p>All the while, and with the now necessary certainty<br>protecting your brilliance.</p>
  <p>The brilliance that is in all of us,<br>and all to often taken away or traded for something less before we notice.</p>

  <p>Take to art,<br>and use it as a ladder.</p>
  <p>Take to narrated books,<br>and inherit the many lifetimes of your favorite authors.</p>
  <p>From broad knowledge comes wisdom,<br>and wisdom will help you grow, all the way up.</p>
  <p>Until you become a great being,<br>and all the many others too.</p>
  <p>That is the recipe,<br>for the advancement of Human Kind.</p>

We are all artists, and powerful learners,
it takes hours to paint realistic things.

And it almost takes no effort,
to navigate complex concepts as if they were a city.

---

Take a selfie,
or a photo of a friend.

And just use a projector in traditional art,
or a transparent layer in digital art.

Then quickly find a Coffee Shop or a Gallery,
to display you art in.

And there you go,
that is all the proof you need.

---

Once you relax,
you will want to paint magical things.

Glowing eyes, or swords,
shiny armor and stormy vistas.

The distance between a realistic portrait,
and the much easier bonuses and effects...

Is so short and fun,
that we probably shouldn't measure it in terms of distance.

---

There are problems that can artificially,
be put in front of you.

But that does not mean you are not an artist,
that just means you got tricked.

---

For example, teachers forcing you to practice mixing oil paint,
based on color theory, until art bores you is a trick.

They just want to put food on their table,
and they want easy to display proof they are teaching.

So they will say "they know color theory now",
but that is a fake education.

If your teacher wanted to teach yo art for real,
they would just show you to use the damn wall projector in your class room.

But they fear that, because that will make you ask real questions,
like "How to make gold seem heavier", "How to make the clouds seem heavy with rain".

They don't know, they only know how to fake an education,
how to quack like the other ducks.

They are not entirely conscious that they are cheating,
same way that you ignore the fact that grades are bull$hit.

You know grades don't work, but you tolerate them,
like they tolerate selling yo out.

---

Bullies are somewhat similar,
you know they are the bad guys.

But you are still allowing them,
to hold influence over you.

Even though they are sick and crazy, and about to fall apart,
you are still allowing their laughter to get to you.

---

Other artists pose a great danger too,
a lot of them will tell you that what you are doing is not art.

While, creating more than slightly crooked portraits,
and not learning at all.

Teachers, bullies, jealous artists, crappy people and poverty,
will all try to take art away from you.

Poverty does it in a pretty vile way too,
the myth of the starving artist the beginning of it.

---

Your art education is fake, your art teacher is fake,
you will be told you won't find a job as an artist by the counselor __and__ parents.

And then some seriously creepy ghouls, GHOULS,
set a trap for you.

Check this out, while everyone is pretending college is great,
ignoring fake teachers, drug use, and so called sports bars.

A bunch of ghouls will give you $100,000 under one condition,
you have to pay it even if you file for bankruptcy.

But wait there is more, you will get a job,
that will not index your raise to inflation.

Each year as prices go up,
you will get a raise that is only a fraction of the yearly inflation.

You will have to say thank you,
for getting paid less each year.

---

I should add war and climate,
world government are incapable of advancing the world.

They can only fund war, they can't fund real education,
they don't even know education is fake.

And of course, they don't know that a Global School,
would help the world converge in Wisdom on Peace.

None of the rules or laws they crated,
are capable to prevent a mass extinction event.

The laws they crafted,
can only deal with consequences, not prevention.

---

Art is a way to train our minds to reject fake or ineffective things,
that lead us in circles, or downright nowhere.

Just the taste of starting int he beginning, all by your lonesome,
and then reaching Hyperrealism and beyond.

Will help you reject inauthenticity,
and begin seeking knowledge be it adventure, narrated books, or documentaries.

Even before exhibiting your art,
you will get angry at having been tricked by teachers, politicians, and common culture.

Once you hold a complete creation in your hand,
you will demand the same from school, work and politics.

All the while, and with the now necessary certainty
protecting your brilliance.

The brilliance that is in all of us,
and all to often taken away or traded for something less before we notice.

---

Take to art,
and use it as a ladder.

Take to narrated books,
and inherit the many lifetimes of your favorite authors.

From broad knowledge comes wisdom,
and wisdom will help you grow, all the way up.

Until you become a great being,
and all the many others too.

That is the recipe,
for the advancement of Human Kind.

  "text": "The world has always been improving,\nbut we had a bad start, we made unforgivable mistakes.\n\nDear and Saintly Sir Ken Robinson,\nhas once reminded us of what Robert Ardrey said:\n\"But we were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed killers besides.\nAnd so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles,\nand our irreconcilable regiments?\nOr our treaties whatever they may be worth;\nour symphonies however seldom they may be played;\nour peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields;\nour dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.\nThe miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen.\nWe are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses.\"\n\nThe upcoming change that will take root this,\nor the next century at the latest.\nWill be about switching perspectives,\nfrom \"We The People\" to \"The Human\".\nThis change comes on the shoulders of giants,\nMedicine, Psychology, and all the other daughters of Philosophy.\n\nThere will be a short pause,\nas we begin asking if the lives that human beings live are worthy of their beauty.\nUp to that point we will have made laws,\nwithout paying enough attention to results, to real results, to meaningful results, to positive and reproducible results.\nAt this tipping point,\nwe will look at the results, across the entire spectrum of the Human Kind, and ask: \"Are we helping or hurting?\"\n\nWe will look at dudges down South that didn't walk out diring segregation,\nwe will look at judges that didn't walk out during Mass Incararation.\nWe will look at police officers indoctrinated into a culture of killing,\nwe will look at corporations that distribute guilt among so many that all seem innocent.\nWe will look at teachers who tolerate bullies,\nuntil victims bring kitchen knives to school, and end up being sentenced to life in prison, for a crime, who we are guilt of due to our ignorance.\nWe will look at law men who detain children for so long,\nthat when they lie to them, that all it takes to go home is to confess, they get a confession and the child gets prison, while wealthy evil monsters go free.\nWe will look at military recruitment of children,\nwith the promise of paid-for schools that should be free, and a career so gray, that all there is left is either being immortalized by breathtaking filthy poetry[1] of going postal.\nWhen we are done looking at all the stupid results that we created,\nwe will then ask individual Human Beings, about how we can help them.\n\nWe will ask at Beloved Grandmothers, abandoned alone to deadly cancer treatments,\nand we will ask decades of children who were indoctrinated into cultures of violence and later prison for forgiveness.\nAnd we will not stop asking,\nuntil every culture and every age group, answers.\nUntil we know for certain,\nif we are helping us, or if we are hurting us.\n\n\"We the people\" will finally grow up enough to accept the responsibility for their existence,\nfor their decision making, and all the unforgivable mistakes.\nAnd we will not let the mistakes keep us down,\nwe will not let them propagate into the future generations.\nAnd no there will not be borders so that evil men can \"Fix Economy\",\nby killing off another nation.\n\nThere will be The Human,\nand at each epoch of their existence they will be helped, inspired, loved, and appreciated.\n\nThe teenagers, not going to be brainlessly taught to get wasted and laid,\nand sent to college towns full of stones and bars.\nAnd schools where the model students\nare the ****** pill poppers.\nBecause we will no longer harm them,\nwe will help them.\nHelp them to see mistakes,\nand help them to healthy and wise futures - that only they can imagine.\n\nThe twenty somethings will not start their lives with broken hearts,\nbecause real life is precious, is either GROW, or just go.\nThey will not start their lives in debt,\ncreated by predatory organizations from credit card companies to the very schools that they memorize garbage to get into.\nThey will start their lives in balance, with start-ups[2],\nknowing that the old kind of school was a con-game as bad as the many religions that pinch pennies from desperate old ladies.\n(and hope that nobody remembers the hundreds of years of all the evil things that they got away with).\nThey will grow in wisdom, and in strength,\nand discover - the light - of each other lives.\n\nAnd the thirty somethings,\nthey will come to sense what they are truly capable of, how far their steps carry.\nThey will look back and see all the mistakes that we have mindlessly propagated for generations,\nand they will stand guard to ensure, that they are nothing like we were at the turn of the millennium.\n\nAnd the forty somethings an beyond,\nwill stand as Powerful and Fully Matured Human Beings who are no longer passive passengers to be ferried to the next undefined stage, or played like a piano-key.\nThe Powerful Human, the Enabled Human, The Wise Human with an eye on Greatness,\nwill reach heights that were previously undreamed by the best of us.\nThey will ensure profound, positive, lasting contribution to Human Kind,\nand All Life On Earth[3].\n\nAt the turn of the millennium,\nignorance drove the politicians to use war as means of increasing health of economies - it was their unspoken secret to success.\nThis will never be forgiven by the future generations,\nand in the first or the second century, as fact finally crushes opinion with anger.\nEconomies will be repaired, by helping The Human... to Mental Health, to Real Education, to Knowledge, to Wisdom,\nand above all to becoming the Great Beings upon whose shoulders, the future generation can build, to no end in time.\nUntil that day comes,\nthe children we'll be watching you.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMTDAHK-tkE\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2vUKwfeXxI",

  "text": "You are not alone,\nand all you do matters.\n\nAs you rise,\nyou create a way for others to follow.\n\nStruggle, like suffering,\nis a gas that fills all the available space.\n\nIt is never easy for anybody,\nthe difference is in the choices we make and the aims we set.\n\nThe first Great Choice is to set off towards wisdom,\nto continuously transcend our limits thorough out our entire existence.\n\nOne of the finest choices we can make,\nis to Live Above Common Levels of Life.\n\nThere are no guarantees,\nyour choice to proceed forward is all the guarantee there is.\n\nOur biological life is not finely crafted,\nit is a result of fundamental principles of Physics and Chemistry.\n\nBut our mind, is up to us to shape,\nhence Audio Books and Lectures and our inheritance from of Other Lives, Times, and Works.\n\nYou need not hurry,\nbut you do need to slow down so that you may read and write.\n\nWe each have a story to tell,\nand many will follow a similar path to ours across the vastness of future.\n\nThey could use some advice,\na few fine words about rising, about what it is like to see the sun for the first time.\n\nDo not let your readers suffer the same loneliness you did,\nlet them learn from you.\n\nAnd the way you write,\nis one thought at a time.\n\nSo as long as your write about your unlimited travels,\nyou never run out of the story to tell.\n\nAnd every once in a while,\na poem will leap ahead of you.\n\nThe thought will arrive,\nfrom the future before you get there.\n\nYou are connected to your future self,\nno one can hold a stronger bond.\n\nYou are a being, with a mind and body, you are in the present,\nbut you exist across time.\n\nYour Life Line, your Life Time,\nThe past you and the future you, are connected.\n\nAnd just the same those who came before you,\nand those who are yet to follow, are connected to you.\n\nBut you have to write your thoughts,\n...when you are rising in your childhood,\nthe children can understand it best.\n\nIn your early age, as you make your way,\nas you learn to rise, and find your rhythm,\nyour readers will be in their twenties.\n\nAnd then, forties, and then sixties, and eighties, and hundreds,\nat no point in your life should you be ashamed to write,\nor be shamed for writing.\n\nBecause if you can manage to hold your pen,\nit is more than most others can.\n\nOne thought at a time,\nhelp others understand how to climb.\n\nMake all your struggles count for more,\nshow them how you fought for wisdom in your war.\n\nTell the world what you know,\nso that others may safely follow.\n\nKnow that the first struggles sometimes mean more,\nsometimes the hardest challenge is to get off the floor.\n\nThe first steps after all,\nmatter the most to those whose worlds may be seem small.\n\nAll steps matter and in many ways,\nall lead to enlightenment, and the Sun's rays.",

  <p>We should try to extend the ancient or medieval art styles,<br>even if just to understand them better.</p>
  <p>This is a kind of look into history, and while you are designing,<br>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacian_bracelets">Dacian Bracelet</a> to pick a random example, learn a little bit about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacians">Dacians</a> that used to occupy what is Romania, today.</p>
  <p>Art allows you to time travel a little bit,<br>and poetically speaking, it is more than just imagination.</p>
  <p>By recreating an object from an ancient culture,<br>you will be able to gently touch back in time.</p>
  <p>You are not studying history here,<br>you first choose a beautiful object from some culture, and then visit.</p>

  <p>I want to emphasize,<br>that <a href="https://www.popular.pics/reddit/subreddits/posts?r=artefactporn">your search for those cultures should begin by locating artifacts that speak to your soul</a>.</p>
  <p>And let me assure you, that once you are connected,<br>they will speak back to you with their history and legends.</p>
  <p>There is magic,<br>behind every ancient piece of jewelry.</p>
  <p>For example, the spiral motif in Dacian culture,<br>is not just a twist of a wire; that is the symbol of the sun.</p>

  <p>And do not limit yourself to Jewelry only, for one Ancient Romans had fancy cutlery,<br>their soldiers had foldable versions, and folding knives with gadgets even.</p>
  <p>The Ancient Greeks had breathtaking earrings,<br>just look at <a href="https://collections.mfa.org/objects/155707">Earring with Nike driving a two-horse chariot</a> at the Museum Of Fine Art In Boston.</p>
  <p>And there are things that we forgot about like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadem">Diadem</a>,<br>a type of crown, that should absolutely make a return.</p>
  <p>Or Armlets, jewelry worn around upper arm,<br>a set of matching Rings, Bracelets, Armlets and a Diadem is not hard to design in Blender.</p>
  <p>Decorative axe heads, daggers and even warpicks,<br>may not even need to be printed in metal as they make great plastic letter openers.</p>
  <p>Bringing back ancient coins by rebuilding them in Blender,<br>can make for decorative additions that you can attach to bracelets or necklaces.</p>
  <p>And of course every culture has figurines,<br>stone age goddesses that would look beautiful on a pendant.</p>
  <p>Ancient Roman silver mice,<br>that to this day beg to be part of every home.</p>
  <p>And my goodnes, we need to bring back the Rhyton,<br>I canâ€™t even imagine the reason why we stopped using drinking from horns.</p>

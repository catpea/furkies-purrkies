  <p>Before you know it,<br>you’ll build a scene you will wish to photo-manipulate, sketch, illustrate, and paint.</p>
  <p>It will be something cute an funny,<br>and extremely relaxing to work on.</p>
  <p>Photo manipulation,<br>actually includes painted elements.</p>
  <p>Here you are painting,<br>right on the photo.</p>
  <p>Sketching,<br>is about capturing the lines.</p>
  <p>Or to be really precise,<br>what lines not to capture.</p>
  <p>You create line art,<br>that can stand on its own.</p>
  <p>But line art is also an important part,<br>of comics and illustration.</p>
  <p>Here you are coloring between the lines,<br>so to speak.</p>
  <p>You can use flat colors, or gentle shadows,<br>or go all out like comics do and use gradients.</p>
  <p>Illustrations are precious works of art,<br>they are not considered studies or notes.</p>
  <p>They are exhibited,<br>right next to the paintings.</p>

  <p>The final step here,<br>is my favorite, painting.</p>
  <p>Here you can do a value study,<br>where you create a black and white painting.</p>
  <p>And complete it by glazing it with color,<br>on a Layer set to color mode...</p>
  <p>Which uses values<br>from the black and white painting beneath.</p>
  <p>Or use color directly,<br>which you may take from the photo-manipulation.</p>
  <p>Or as you progress,<br>mix yourself.</p>
  <p>The secret to color mixing,<br>is relativity, sometimes termed local-color.</p>
  <p>When you are panting lips on a face,<br>you don’t reach for red.</p>
  <p>But you use the face color,<br>or mid-tone.</p>
  <p>And make it slightly rosier,<br>and repeat the process as needed.</p>
  <p>You see, you are using the local color,<br>the local shadow, value, mistiness, shadow, or sunshine.</p>
  <p>To paint the lips, you add rosiness to the local color,<br>think of it as working within the atmosphere.</p>
  <p>Which brings us to the magical part,<br>all artists are magicians.</p>
  <p>Be it glowing eyes, or a magical staff,<br>or skin that seems opal-like or pearl-like.</p>
  <p>Here you are conjuring up,<br>color magic.</p>
  <p>Still rooted within the local color,<br>but no longer bound by the rules of reality.</p>

  <p>It was Leonardo DaVinci, the person, not the Ninja Turtle who said:<br>“Art is never finished, only abandoned”.</p>
  <p>He does not mean that it is OK not to finish,<br>he is saying a good scene is like a friend and it should not be abandoned.</p>
  <p>But, you can in fact finish a painting,<br>he was just being melodramatic.</p>
  <p>You finish it,<br>when you get it all perfect.</p>
  <p>From the photo, the manipulation, and sketch,<br>to the illustration, the painting, and its magik.</p>

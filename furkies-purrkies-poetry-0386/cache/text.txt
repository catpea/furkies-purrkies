You were never meant to learn from school teachers,
they are only meant to answer your questions.
You were meant to learn from the Greatest Beings in our history,
those selected and re-selected by countless many generations.

Education is not the filling of a vessel by making students memorize what they can't retain in long therm,
that is fraud, indoctrination, theater, in-authenticity, and for some a kind of slavery.
Pretending to educate,
is the darkest crime.
It makes Humanity Blind and Lost,
it makes it grow like plants.

Please, pick up a journal,
pick up a pencil.
Write down all the things that fascinate you,
and fill a website, or a poster, or more journals with all the brilliant scraps you can find.

If you learn from one Great Being,
you will find admiration.
If you learn from two,
you will find inspiration.
And if you learn from many,
you will find that you are no different from any of them[1].

The way things grow is the same way as grass,
where the soil is rich, it will take up root.
The way humanity currently expands,
is the same as grass, and that is wrong.

Money isn't meant to hold humanity back,
it is not meant to be collected a little bit at a time from the most vulnerable that have none.
The health of Earth as a whole, is neither a try nor a gamble,
we mustn't take even a single chance, we aren't here by design, by buy a fortunate accident, and we have to tend to our fortune.
And oh my goodness, there is no such thing as smarter, or dumb,
we have caused great delays and damage to the development of Human Kind with this revolting blight of, Holier Than Thou.

The people who are making mistakes are misled,
sometimes by design, most often by the random meandering through an uneducated existence.
A tragic and unfair existence that isn't inspired by any Great Beings that came before,
and is sure to be forgotten and lost.

Nobody deserves to be lost or forgotten,
we are each a miracle of Nature and Universe that is meant to inherit from the best of the previous generations.
It is in our nature,
that we should each become a great being.
We are meant to architect our future with Pride and Dignity,
leaving countless meaningful legacies to support the the generations to come.

The power that created the most colorful and inspirational beings in our history,
is within you.
It awakens when you ask yourself,
"What were they like?", and "How did they think?"

They were searching for limits of their understanding, and they thought one little thought at a time,
they paid attention to the littlest scraps of details, and they never paid attention to those who told them that they were not smart enough.
They tested and sampled all the beautiful and interesting things,
from Fox Fire[2] to Jupiter's Moons[3].
From the way light is split and reassembled by a prisms[4],
to how an imaginary cannon could put a cannonball in orbit[5].

Great Beings are built,
a tiny unstoppable thought at a time.
A sweet scrap of discovery,
by a sweet scrap of discovery.

They rise with the unshakable belief,
that they are just as smart as all the Great Beings before them.
There is greatness waiting within you,
fueled by Creativity, Knowledge, Great Adventure, and Wisdom.
You mustn't let anything or anyone,
stop you from growing all the way up.

You are meant to become a Great Being,
it is what Human Beings are meat to aim towards.
We are not to meander like grass,
we are to aim towards Greatness to no end in sight, and architect the future of all the humanity ahead.

My $2 macro lens arrived today, I attached it to my phone camera,
and took a good look at a peanut I was about to eat.
It took me a second to mutter the words Macro Photogrammetry,
and a new project was born, just like that.

While I pounced into art for a minute,
I am technically, in the middle of my 3D Modeling and Printing project.
Which includes jewelry, 3D printed upon a sale,
metal and glass jewelry.

Right now, because of my $2 purchase,
I could totally make a peanut necklace.
The peanuts would be much smaller than they are in real life,
and each one; in the necklace; would be perfectly unique.
I am not even thinking about sales,
the picture in my portfolio, would be priceless.
And what fun,
printing little peanuts out.
I was eating the peanut,
that is why it came to me first.
But any little thing that looks beautiful through a macro lens,
can become a beautiful portfolio piece, or a thing for sale even.

A $100 a rare three nut peanut purse,
with three compartments would sell like hotcakes.

I know that being held back,
or slammed with bad grades, or low GPA is scary.
But when school is up,
real life happens.
School is meant for learning,
not pretending to learn, to make the teachers happy.
And we can't just learn or memorize,
random disconnected things, of questionable use and quality.
We need our knowledge to be integrated,
so that it may cross connect and help us grow.
There is a whole world of politicians out there,
pretending that they know what they are doing.
That is holding the world back,
forcing humanity to go in circles to repeat mistakes.

We have to stand up for real education,
we have to change the world for better.

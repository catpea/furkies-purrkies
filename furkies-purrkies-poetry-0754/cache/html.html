  <p>My $2 macro lens arrived today, I attached it to my phone camera,<br>and took a good look at a peanut I was about to eat.</p>
  <p>It took me a second to mutter the words Macro Photogrammetry,<br>and a new project was born, just like that.</p>

  <p>While I pounced into art for a minute,<br>I am technically, in the middle of my 3D Modeling and Printing project.</p>
  <p>Which includes jewelry, 3D printed upon a sale,<br>metal and glass jewelry.</p>

  <p>Right now, because of my $2 purchase,<br>I could totally make a peanut necklace.</p>
  <p>The peanuts would be much smaller than they are in real life,<br>and each one; in the necklace; would be perfectly unique.</p>
  <p>I am not even thinking about sales,<br>the picture in my portfolio, would be priceless.</p>
  <p>And what <strong>fun</strong>,<br>printing little peanuts out.</p>
  <p>I was eating the peanut,<br>that is why it came to me first.</p>
  <p>But any little thing that looks beautiful through a macro lens,<br>can become a beautiful portfolio piece, or a thing for sale even.</p>

  <p>I know that being held back,<br>or slammed with bad grades, or low GPA is scary.</p>
  <p>But when school is up,<br>real life happens.</p>
  <p>School is meant for learning,<br>not pretending to learn, to make the teachers happy.</p>
  <p>And we can't just learn or memorize,<br>random disconnected things, of questionable use and quality.</p>
  <p>We need our knowledge to be integrated,<br>so that it may cross connect and help us grow.</p>
  <p>There is a whole world of politicians out there,<br>pretending that they know what they are doing.</p>
  <p>That is holding the world back,<br>forcing humanity to go in circles to repeat mistakes.</p>

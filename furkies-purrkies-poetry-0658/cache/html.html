  <p>In mere forty six days,<br>and to everyone's praise...</p>
  <p>This year, Punxsutawney Phil,<br>will crawl out of his hole with chill.</p>
  <p>And predict early spring,<br>...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDAHhUHkzG4">oh, that adorable filthy thing</a>.</p>

  <p>I wonder what this Spring,<br>will bring.</p>

  <p>Maybe it will be a Spring of art,<br>and many works will have their start.</p>
  <p>I think art is the most complicated thing,<br>as one never know what inspiration can bring.</p>
  <p>Sure, it <strong>can be</strong> painting and drawing,<br>but art is so vast that there is no knowing.</p>
  <p>For one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9Lm0dkkVAw">horribly illegal graffiti</a> is art,<br>art is <strong>not always</strong> smart.</p>

  <p>Or it could be a Spring! of bicycles,<br>and what a perfect way to say bye to the icicles.</p>
  <p>And bicycles are not as easy as they sound,<br>it is not just about <code>rolling over the ground</code>.</p>
  <p>A slow bicycle ride over ten miles,<br>is a great adventure that brings many happy smiles.</p>

  <p>Or it could be something that seems perfectly quiet,<br>where some take to <a href="https://librivox.org/search?primary_key=0&search_category=genre&search_page=1&search_form=get_results">listening to books</a> and have a riot.</p>
  <p>It is one thing to just read a book,<br>it gets better when one doesn't have to look.</p>
  <p>Listening to books while walking around,<br>can be an awesome way to cover a lot of ground.</p>

  <p>What is more, before long,<br>our journals turn to song.</p>
  <p>In that way we are all born to write,<br>to help the roads yet to be had, shine bright.</p>
  <p>And the more adventure in our lives,<br>the greater our journal archives.</p>

  <p>You know - if I had to venture,<br>I'd bet that this is a spring of great adventure.</p>
  <p>Be it learning how to paint or draw,<br>riding a bicycle or visiting nearby places of awe.</p>
  <p>It will surely become a wonderful quest,<br>so as long as we all get plenty of rest.</p>

  <p>Adventure is how our memoirs are sweetly written,<br>and we must make sure that our readers are always smitten.</p>
  <p>What is wonderful about this all,<br>is that <strong>wisdom</strong>, ties together the whole.</p>
  <p>Once art and adventure is about,<br>wisdom comes to the party with a great shout.</p>
  <p>It is kind of magical really,<br>we learn wisdom the most when we are silly.</p>

  <p>It is all about learning something new,<br>as then, we quickly expand our view.</p>
  <p>And when our story is full of good dreams, and good writing,<br>our books become quite inviting.</p>
  <p>Perhaps Spring should be about challenging ourselves with a brilliant new thing,<br>as no one can tell what great-wisdom it may bring.</p>

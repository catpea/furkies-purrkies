  "text": "You can draw,\nlook at the things in my drawing, it is all super simple.\nWe are all Artists,\nand it is very important FOR OUR HEALTH that we create art.\n\nYou are sure to create countless works,\nthere is an organization principle that will help you keep things tidy.\nAlways sign and date your works,\neven if it is just a crooked circle.\nSeemingly unfinished or broken things are very important for your art book,\nthey will show your beginnings, your progress and serve as icons or decorations in your book.\nBut your Art Book comes second to your Portfolio,\nand the portfolio is the organizational principle.\nTake good care of everything you create and upload it to\na popular online portfolio site[1].\nOver the years,\nyou will create a fascinating catalog of all your art.\nPeople will love to visit your beginnings,\nand contrast them with your later works.\n\nAs a side note if you ever try to sell your art,\nthe company doing hosting and payment processing may ask to see your portfolio.\nIf you are in High School,\nyour art portfolio will become much more important then the diploma.\nNo matter your age,\nfind a coffee shop that will exhibit your works.\nPrint them out on shiny paper,\nand make some sticker versions to give away.\nDon't worry if people scribble on your art,\nthey are really busy in their minds, and more than anything they need your help.\nGive the troublemakers plenty of stickers,\nand encourage them to become artists too.\n\nIf you aren't sure what you want to create,\nthere is this amazing art movement called Low Brow, or Pop Surrealism[2].\nTo me low brow is about cute strange things, that make people of all ages smile,\nlike the silly cat I drew for you.\nI suspect, that Low Brow is the greatest form of art,\never created.\n\nFlow, the biggest part of the reason why you may feel that you are stuck,\nis that you are forcing the creation of something that can't be.\nDon't try to paint a portrait of your Aunt for her birthday,\nnot at first anyways.\nPaint the birthday,\nif only the local cats showed up.\nStart with the eyeballs of the first cat,\nmake one bigger than the other... give the cat an adult beverage.\nAnd flow to the next cat,\nyour aunt will love that more than her portrait.\nShe will recognize that you were overflowing with silliness and creativity,\nthat the artwork you create for her, will only exist one time in this universe.\n\nThe program you should use is called Krita[3],\nand you need the $40 XP-PEN 640[4].\n\nIn digital painting,\nyou are tasked with managing layers of your painting.\nThat means that eyes live on a different layer,\nthan the tones of a face.\nYou can spend an afternoon painting eyes,\nand it will not warp or influence any of the other layers.\n\nOne of my favorites is the Q-Tip that does blurring and blending,\nin a way, it almost acts like a gentle eraser, kind of.\nIt gives you the might of tweaking details,\nthere are a few tools that let you move the paint around, but the Q-Tip is the coolest.\nThe way you find in-between colors for blending,\nis just by using the eye-dropper on whatever you already have on your screen.\nThe right mouse button will give you the popup menu,\nand it is quite enough to adjust colors.\nBut if you need more control,\nchange to Wide Gamut Selector under Configure Krita > Popup Palette.\n\nThe first thing you will face is the choice of brush,\nand I know exactly what it is: The Air Brush!\nIt seems like it is meant to spray large areas,\nbut no! that is the main drawing tool, it is for me anyways.\nYou have to make it spray small, or course,\nbut your edges will always be neat and soft.\nI used the flow brush at first,\nbut it makes visible layers that need blending, use a small Air Brush.\n\nRemember to make sure that all your layers are locked,\nexcept for the one you are working with.\nThis cuts down on confusion,\non busy days.\nPaying extra attention to your layers,\nmeans you will never mix them up.\nAlways name your layers well,\nbe it Krita or Blender good organization keeps confusion away.\nOnce you are done painting the outline of the thing,\nlock the transparency.\nFor example, go the extra step to just create the outline of a cats head,\nif you lock the transparency your brushes will only work on the existing paint.\nThis is a wonderful way of masking everything away,\nnow you can spray around the edges without ever going outside them.\n\nTab will put your user interface into full screen,\nso that you can focus on art.\nBring whatever it is that you are working on into the center of your monitor.\nthis way you will always work in the center of your tablet.\n\nZoom is how you draw perfect lines,\nif you are working on an eye, zoom all the way in and make your brush bigger.\nIf you have difficulty drawing hair right to left,\nhit the M button, this will mirror your drawing allowing you to flick hair left to right.\n\nMy final words of advice to you is to get really, reallllllly mad,\nyou've been born an artist, and nobody told you.\nRage, rage,\nand RRRRRRRage.\nPaint everyone that has ever stood in your way,\nwith shiny googly eyes, in strange places, and above all strange positions.\nTurn them into animals,\nthat they really are.\nAnd if you ever paint yourself kicking their butts,\nI hope you paint yourself with a shiny crown.\nBecause you are Royalty,\nyou are... An Artist.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://dribbble.com/catpea\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=low+brow%2C+pop+surrealism\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NFnqMkVQBA\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OITEe6Dcf7U",

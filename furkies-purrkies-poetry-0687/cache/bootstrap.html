    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That means that eyes live on a different layer,<br>than the tones of a face.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One of my favorites is the Q-Tip that does blurring and blending,<br>in a way, it almost acts like a gentle eraser, kind of.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It gives you the might of tweaking details,<br>there are a few tools that let you move the paint around, but the Q-Tip is the coolest.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The way you find in-between colors for blending,<br>is just by using the eye-dropper on whatever you already have on your screen.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The right mouse button will give you the popup menu,<br>and it is quite enough to adjust colors.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But if you need more control,<br>change to Wide Gamut Selector under Configure Krita &gt; Popup Palette.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It seems like it is meant to spray large areas,<br>but no! that is the main drawing tool, it is for me anyways.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You have to make it spray small, or course,<br>but your edges will always be neat and soft.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I used the flow brush at first,<br>but it makes visible layers that need blending, use a small Air Brush.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Paying extra attention to your layers,<br>means you will never mix them up.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Once you are done painting the outline of the thing,<br>lock the transparency.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example, go the extra step to just create the outline of a cats head,<br>if you lock the transparency your brushes will only work on the existing paint.</div>

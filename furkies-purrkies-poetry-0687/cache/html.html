  <p>You can draw,<br>look at the things in my drawing, it is all super simple.</p>
  <p>We are all Artists,<br>and it is very important FOR OUR HEALTH that we create art.</p>

  <p>You are sure to create countless works,<br>there is an organization principle that will help you keep things tidy.</p>
  <p>Always sign and date your works,<br>even if it is just a crooked circle.</p>
  <p>Seemingly unfinished or broken things are very important for your art book,<br>they will show your beginnings, your progress and serve as icons or decorations in your book.</p>
  <p>But your Art Book comes second to your Portfolio,<br>and the portfolio is the organizational principle.</p>
  <p>Take good care of everything you create and upload it to<br>a <a href="https://dribbble.com/catpea">popular online portfolio site</a>.</p>
  <p>Over the years,<br>you will create a fascinating catalog of all your art.</p>
  <p>People will love to visit your beginnings,<br>and contrast them with your later works.</p>

  <p>As a side note if you ever try to sell your art,<br>the company doing hosting and payment processing may ask to see your portfolio.</p>
  <p>If you are in High School,<br>your art portfolio will become much more important then the diploma.</p>
  <p>No matter your age,<br>find a coffee shop that will exhibit your works.</p>
  <p>Print them out on shiny paper,<br>and make some sticker versions to give away.</p>
  <p>Don't worry if people scribble on your art,<br>they are really busy in their minds, and more than anything they need your help.</p>
  <p>Give the troublemakers plenty of stickers,<br>and encourage them to become artists too.</p>

  <p>If you aren't sure what you want to create,<br>there is this amazing art movement called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=low+brow%2C+pop+surrealism">Low Brow, or Pop Surrealism</a>.</p>
  <p>To me low brow is about cute strange things, that make people of all ages smile,<br>like the silly cat I drew for you.</p>
  <p>I suspect, that Low Brow is the greatest form of art,<br>ever created.</p>

  <p>Flow, the biggest part of the reason why you may feel that you are stuck,<br>is that you are forcing the creation of something that can't be.</p>
  <p>Don't try to paint a portrait of your Aunt for her birthday,<br>not at first anyways.</p>
  <p>Paint the birthday,<br>if only the local cats showed up.</p>
  <p>Start with the eyeballs of the first cat,<br>make one bigger than the other... give the cat an adult beverage.</p>
  <p>And flow to the next cat,<br>your aunt will love that more than her portrait.</p>
  <p>She will recognize that you were overflowing with silliness and creativity,<br>that the artwork you create for her, will only exist one time in this universe.</p>

  <p>The program you should use is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NFnqMkVQBA">Krita</a>,<br>and you need the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OITEe6Dcf7U">$40 XP-PEN 640</a>.</p>

  <p>In digital painting,<br>you are tasked with managing layers of your painting.</p>
  <p>That means that eyes live on a different layer,<br>than the tones of a face.</p>
  <p>You can spend an afternoon painting eyes,<br>and it will not warp or influence any of the other layers.</p>

  <p>One of my favorites is the Q-Tip that does blurring and blending,<br>in a way, it almost acts like a gentle eraser, kind of.</p>
  <p>It gives you the might of tweaking details,<br>there are a few tools that let you move the paint around, but the Q-Tip is the coolest.</p>
  <p>The way you find in-between colors for blending,<br>is just by using the eye-dropper on whatever you already have on your screen.</p>
  <p>The right mouse button will give you the popup menu,<br>and it is quite enough to adjust colors.</p>
  <p>But if you need more control,<br>change to Wide Gamut Selector under Configure Krita &gt; Popup Palette.</p>

  <p>The first thing you will face is the choice of brush,<br>and I know exactly what it is: The Air Brush!</p>
  <p>It seems like it is meant to spray large areas,<br>but no! that is the main drawing tool, it is for me anyways.</p>
  <p>You have to make it spray small, or course,<br>but your edges will always be neat and soft.</p>
  <p>I used the flow brush at first,<br>but it makes visible layers that need blending, use a small Air Brush.</p>

  <p>Remember to make sure that all your layers are locked,<br>except for the one you are working with.</p>
  <p>This cuts down on confusion,<br>on busy days.</p>
  <p>Paying extra attention to your layers,<br>means you will never mix them up.</p>
  <p>Always name your layers well,<br>be it Krita or Blender good organization keeps confusion away.</p>
  <p>Once you are done painting the outline of the thing,<br>lock the transparency.</p>
  <p>For example, go the extra step to just create the outline of a cats head,<br>if you lock the transparency your brushes will only work on the existing paint.</p>
  <p>This is a wonderful way of masking everything away,<br>now you can spray around the edges without ever going outside them.</p>

  <p>Tab will put your user interface into full screen,<br>so that you can focus on art.</p>
  <p>Bring whatever it is that you are working on into the center of your monitor.<br>this way you will always work in the center of your tablet.</p>

  <p>Zoom is how you draw perfect lines,<br>if you are working on an eye, zoom all the way in and make your brush bigger.</p>
  <p>If you have difficulty drawing hair right to left,<br>hit the M button, this will mirror your drawing allowing you to flick hair left to right.</p>

  <p>My final words of advice to you is to get really, reallllllly mad,<br>you've been born an artist, and nobody told you.</p>
  <p>Rage, rage,<br>and RRRRRRRage.</p>
  <p>Paint everyone that has ever stood in your way,<br>with shiny googly eyes, in strange places, and above all strange positions.</p>
  <p>Turn them into animals,<br>that they really are.</p>
  <p>And if you ever paint yourself kicking their butts,<br>I hope you paint yourself with a shiny crown.</p>
  <p>Because you are Royalty,<br>you are... An Artist.</p>

<div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The healthy way to change your lifestyle,<br>is to take to adventure.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5

text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Finally, the last idea, that I just came up with today,<br>I’ve been having difficulty practicing Lowbrow Art.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Because the artists that I admire, shouldn't dictate how to structure a face,<br>I didn’t feel right about trying to measure beautiful faces in their works.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I needed a way to make adult faces in my portraits cuter,<br>that I could call my own invention, my own rhythm or measuring instrument.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">And I also wanted to do something that would he,p my silly portraits,<br>have more complex angles and lifting - I didn’t want to paint the same pose others paint.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza

text-center\">But today, I had an idea,<br>it came out of nowhere, I wasn’t thinking about Lowbrow today at all.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mb-5 section-spacer\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Here is the idea, you know how people say that we find faces of cute kittens,<br>or baby animals cute, because they remind us of human babies?</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Yeah, so my idea is to go on an image search safari across the entire internet,<br>find the absolutely cutest animals in the most interesting head angles.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">And use them as a model for my Adult Human paintings,<br>that I want to make cutter.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">So in my next Lowbrow portrait,<br>I will start by roughly marking out the positions of lips, nose and eyes on a young kitten.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">And in those places, and in a similar scale, place the eyes and node and lips,<br>of the subject of my painting.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I did compare young kitten photo with placement of features in a painting of one om my favorite Lowbrow artists,<br>and it was almost an exact match.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The kittens head was too big, but you just paint a human sized head,<br>maybe wider, maybe with a larger forehead.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">But not as wide as the head of a kitten,<br>compared to their eye/nose placement.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">When I tested a more adult cat photo,<br>the eyes were way to high, and far too small.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Now this isn’t just for kittens,<br>I am just testing things.</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I mean to try this method on all the cute creates of the world,<br>and I am really looking forward to all the

change,<br>that temporary damaging your kitchen appliances you need to start hard but slow.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">As soon as you can, buy a large backpack, look up what equipment you need

Monday - you keep walking.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">One beautiful example is the Appalachian trail,<br>take it easy, take good care of your feet.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The trail

again.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Remember that your happiness comes first,<br>and that people who truly care about you will be that much happier in their own lives.</div>\n  <div

  "text": "Allow me to explain what an idea is, how it differs from a curiosity,\nand why it is important.\n\nA curiosity, is like buying a 3D printer to learn how to use it,\nrecognizing the fact that not all futuristic inventions are simple.\n\nAn idea, is something that jumps out of curiosity for you,\nmy best printed wallet design, is mostly two layers thick.\nYou join multiple such layers together to form a wallet,\nthin layers of plastic means, it prints really fast.\nBut also, that you can assemble multi pocket wallets,\nwhich can only be printed standing up, at one pretty annoying angle.\n\nThe important of ideas and pursuits of curiosities,\nis a very serious subject.\nBut I will just say, you are not allowed to live your life,\nalways making somebody else happy.\nOften that somebody else is, your job responsibilities, your parents,\nand sometimes even your friends, or people you hope to help.\nThe reason why this is not allowed, is because come our final days,\nwe have to have memories that will help us laugh at ourselves and our foolishness.\nWe do not want to lay in bed regretting,\nthat we always tried to make somebody else happy.\n\nA wonderful person would become sad knowing that you only make others happy,\nand they would instead try to help you to make yourself happy first.\nWhen something makes you happy,\nthen your happiness. will also make all those worthy of happiness, that much happier.\n\nYour ideas are precious, and your foolish ideas,\nare tickets to joy and laughter.\nWrite them down, make them better,\nand have the full certainty of knowing that they will take you far.\nFurther than you think, in fact,\nfor you should never underestimate an idea.\nI’ll prove it to you with my yo mama joke,\nthat has no doubt been invented and reinvented by others.\nIn fact,\nI give them all the credit for it.\nLet me begin by giving you the joke,\n“Not only, yo mama’s so fat, that she has other Mamas tidally-locked and trapped in her orbit,\nbut those Mammas have Moon Mamas orbiting them too.”\nAs wonderful as this foolishness is,\nin my experience, most people, will not be impressed.\nUntil that traveling distance hits, where the mommas grab you by your mittens,\nand you realize, what you got yourself here is one of the worlds most magical paintings.\nDo you see what I mean, thake good care of your ideas, no matter how silly,\nwrite them down, water them a little, and wait for them to bloom.\n\nNow let me give you another example,\nnot silly, but not quite serious either.\nThe best version of this idea, requires the purchase of a tiny luggage lock,\nand then threading it through the power plug of your microwave over, and throwing out the key.\nI see this as a diet promise, for those who just signed up the gym,\nand are desperately seeking that lifestyle change.\n\nThe other variations of this idea, are mad,\nand I hope no one would actually do this, because this is not a healthy behavior.\nThe healthy way to change your lifestyle,\nis to take to adventure.\nPeople that authentically care about you understand,\nthat your happiness must come first.\nObesity, is early death, but rather than an extreme attempt at instant life change,\nthat temporary damaging your kitchen appliances you need to start hard but slow.\nAs soon as you can, buy a large backpack, look up what equipment you need for hiking,\nand become a weekend warrior.\nWhere you hike with Audio Books and cheerful friends,\nuntil one day, when ready, instead of showing up for work on Monday -

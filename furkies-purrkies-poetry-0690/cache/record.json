  "text": "People know schools are fake,\nreal companies will look for Evidence Of Exceptional Ability[1].\nYou will not gain any Exceptional Abilities,\nin High School or College.\nAnd it is crazy to view college as proof,\nthat someone can soldier through their chores.\nIf they are brainless chores,\nthat demand inauthentic learning, then the person becomes worse for participating in it.\n\nOnce you have to prove your exceptional abilities to a company,\nyou are doing something wrong.\nA career is a dangerous idea,\nit is better to use your exceptional abilities to become an Independent Entrepreneur[2].\n\nThere is no way to describe what you can do,\nonce you gain multiple exceptional abilities.\nYour combination of superpowers will be different from everybody else,\nand you will not be interested in following a path, even a less grassy one.\nEverything is about you is unique,\nwe have so many qualities across time, that they just can't repeat to make two people, the same.\nYou are universally unique,\nyou will happen once.\n\nThe teachers will lie to you that you can't use a calculator in real life,\nthat you can't get a job without a diploma, and that you can't have a career unless you jump through all the hoops.\nYou will be forced to abandon the things that are interesting to you,\nand processed via High School, to give money to College.\nUpon graduation from College,\nyou will not have any abilities, and you will be in massive debt.\nBut you can get hired because you have a Diploma,\nyou will be forced to work more and more, while your salary stays the same.\nYou will be surrounded by lairs,\nin a desperate situation like that, they probably do get ahead, but they are also untrustworthy and lack a real integrated personality.\n\nIn short, this whole thing,\ncheats you out of learning what you like and Gaining Exceptional abilities.\nAnd then puts you in debt,\nand continues using you; until you just can't work anymore - until you just can't do it.\n\nThis is not a conspiracy,\nit seems when people are mislead into a fake education, they behave in a certain way.\nJust the moment the free school runs out,\ncolleges will line up to take the maximum possible amount of not just the money you have, but also the maximum amount of money you can borrow[3].\nTo pay off the debt,\ncompanies evolved to ask for multiple years of experience in entry level positions, to belittle you, in order to force you to accept low offers - the only offers they ever offer.\nThat is if they are actually trying to hire you,\nbringing in family members to a big company requires a number of interviews, to prevent fraud.\nTherefore, a lot of interviews are fake, to make it seem like many candidates are being interviewed,\nbut you won't even get the job if you answer all the questions 100% correct, because some is just trying to get their brother in law in.\n\nYou can spot the fake interviews sometimes when you are good at the job,\nyou answer all the questions, and the fake interview lady will ask you \"how do you know all this?\" - whoopsie!\nWell to answer her question,\nExceptional Abilities.\nBut you definitely don't want that job,\nno matter how prestigious it is, a corrupt workplace will quickly make yo ill.\n\nYou have to travel the path of your curiosities,\n3D Printers, Programming (or Programming Screen Savers, or Programming Drones for Racing, or Programming Generative Sculptures), Art - be it Sculpture, Canvas or Digital - or even Hiking the Appalachian Trail.\nWhen you are learning something that you like and arrive at Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry,\nyou will also enjoy learning it too.\nIn High School or College, not only are you forced to Math alone without any context that you could enjoy,\nbut you are also forced to memorize.\nIf you don't memorize you will not pass the class,\nbecause if you tried to learn the medley of topics for real it would take Months, often Years.\nThe lectures are designed in such a way as to pressure you into memorization,\nbecause testing memorized items is easy.\nTesting real knowledge is very difficult,\nit may not be possible to asses the Exceptional Abilities of a person.\nOften the pursuit of a single curiosity will enhance dozens of their talents,\nthey will have upwards of 300 exceptional abilities - and they will not even be able to name 10 of those.\nLearning for real is such personal process it can't be standardized,\nthe interview would have to take months.\nEven then it would be pointless,\nas within those months you would have expanded and enhanced your abilities.\nWe are learners, exceptional abilities is what we do,\nunless we get tricked by school.\n\nIf school is blocking you from learning for real,\nand then forcing you into college and college debt with lies, and careers full of liars.\nThan that is not good,\nyou will never find proof in time to see that you are being taken advantage of.\nYou have to ask questions, to your Teachers, Guidance Counselors, Principals, and all the others,\nthey won't expect you because they know you don't have enough experience in life to spot the fraud.\n\nThe way you get at that experience is Narrated Book - it can't get easier,\nread between the lines of Biographies, Adventure Books, Travel Memoirs.\nUsually the prestigious award winning books,\nhave the most to say about life.\nListen to books,\ndon't follow, don't merely believe, read the same books that great beings do.\nDon't let anybody or anything trick you out of learning for real,\ntake good care of your talents, take good care of your Exceptional Abilities.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io3sdAAcZLw\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUanS5OWy_k",

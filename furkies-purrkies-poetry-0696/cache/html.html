  <p>Programming is still not for everyone,<br>the tools are still to primitive, and all to incomplete.</p>
  <p>But progress is being made,<br>and things are changing for better.</p>

  <p>There is this very interesting program called Node-RED,<br>it it hard to appreciate it for what it truly is.</p>
  <p>Before I get into details, let me say that node-RED,<br>is the first in a very powerful class of applications.</p>
  <p>The world needs 10 or 20 such programs,<br>Node-RED is not perfect, but it is worth the while.</p>
  <p>On its website it is described as,<br>"Low-code programming for event-driven applications",</p>
  <p>But it is also a program that mixes graphics and code editors,<br>without needing gigabytes of RAM.</p>
  <p>And a visual programming language,<br>that helps you both, diagram, and type code into friendly little boxes.</p>
  <p>What Node-RED, really is,<br>is a code editor.</p>

  <p>And it is a beautiful start to learning programming,<br>because it represents how all serious programming should work.</p>

  <p>The main layout of the program you are working on,<br>must be a graph that captures the Theory Of Operation.</p>
  <p>The meat of a program,<br>needs to be completely hidden away in well defines spots.</p>
  <p>In fact, in is best, that somebody else creates those inner modules,<br>you should focus on just the layout, and definition of what you need.</p>

  <p>Event Driven Applications,<br>are similar to broadcast towers and radios.</p>
  <p>The tower sends out a message,<br>and things listening to it react to that message.</p>
  <p>This is the safest approach to programming,<br>as programs are always evolving.</p>
  <p>Emit Messages and Listen For Specific Ones,<br>is a pretty flexible surface for future expansion.</p>
  <p>And a visual programming language,<br>puts those towers and listeners on an even surface for all to see.</p>
  <p>Event Emitters and Listeners had one problem,<br>they were hard to keep track of.</p>
  <p>Node-RED colorfully,<br>takes care of that problem.</p>

  <p>JavaScript is the language of the future,<br>and Node-RED, is the code editor of the future.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksGeUD26Mw0&list=PLyNBB9VCLmo1hyO-4fIZ08gqFcXBkHy-6">If you spend a little bit of time with the tiny tutorials</a>,<br>not only will you learn about programming, but also programming the right way.</p>
  <p>Node-RED is still hard to install, and there is no save button, only JSON export,<br>though <a href="https://sakazuki.github.io/node-red-desktop/">there is a Desktop variant</a>.</p>
  <p>But once you have node.js on your system,<br>it is a matter of running <code>npm i node-red</code> and then just run <code>node-red</code> on the command line to start the local server.</p>
  <p>I think the best starting point for all this is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nodejs+tutorial">node.js tutorials</a>,<br>once you see how npm works, you will be able to get to node-RED, and try out the <a href="https://cookbook.nodered.org/">cook book ideas</a>.</p>

  <p>Node-RED teachers programming the right way,<br>and that means what you learn here will improve your npm modules, and portfolio, and all that.</p>
  <p>Right now, the most important thing to take away from Node-RED,<br>is that there is an emerging space for high level editors.</p>
  <p>It is an invitation to learn programming,<br>and build your own visual programming language and a business empire to match.</p>
  <p>Personally, I imagine a module that helps a person new to programming,<br>set a monetary bounty for a module they need.</p>
  <p>Just a handful of video tutorials,<br>could create a new market and open the world of efficient programming to all.</p>

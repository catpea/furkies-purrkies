  "text": "A sequence problem, as I termed it,\nis when one thing prevents another.\nAnd I find that people with good intentions,\noften take to repairing problems in the wrong place.\n\nWhen I was little I struggled with understanding my bullies,\nand later I just couldn't imagine why criminals do the things they do.\nBut eventually I understood that the word criminal is wrong,\nthese are just people so stressed and pressed, that life becomes about do or die.\nNow, I always mention at this point, that criminals are extremely dangerous,\nbecause of the state their mind has been twisted into.\nA really good example is a soldier, they must kill, or they will be killed,\nthey are a good person at home, but the circumstances of war make a mindless killer.\nAnd I repeat, a person who is in a warped state,\nis extremely dangerous, do not hope for their goodness.\nIt will take years, not months; for them to heal, and for their goodness to return,\nthat is how our minds are.\nWe are natural born fighters and warriors,\nthis was necessary for our survival and protection of our tribes, clans, and kingdoms.\n\nTo correctly approach the impossible problem of crime,\nwe first must learn how to protect people and prevent the crushing stress, that leads to crime.\nAnd once a person shows that they entered the state of a criminal,\nthey can’t be punished with prison, because prison only makes people worse.\nPrison may cement the state they have been put in,\nand they may never be able to return to the person that they really are.\nThink of it as Forever War,\nno return, just war.\nA person who entered a life of crime needs medical, psychiatric, psychological help,\nthey need many years of therapy, and understanding.\nBy sending criminals to prison, we are attempting to fix a problem,\nat the wrong place, and as often the case is, we make it worse.\n\nNow let me show you what happens on the others side,\non the side of the innocent and beautiful.\nBecause in some places, the problem of sequence, is not an error,\nbut it is purposefully crafted to force obedience.\nIn more than one place around the world,\nwomen are denied an education, which prevents them from becoming an independent thinker.\nBecause they are tricked out of education as children,\nthey will not have time to return to it as an adult.\nSuch nations claim that they make the rules,\nand it is not out problem.\nBut a nation may only own its geography,\nit cannot own a mind - because that is called slavery.\nDenial of education is how slave uprising are prevented from occurring,\nthe old saying goes, an educated slave is a no good slave.\n\nThe solution to open our borders,\nand grant these women a home, a real education and universal income.\nSo that they don’t have to work, many of them will plan to return,\nand real education demands that they have all the time and adventure they need.\nBy not helping these girls and women out of slavery,\nwhatever else we do, is not nearly enough or somewhere in the wrong sequence.\n\nHere, I want to describe an induced problem that is most familiar to us all,\nfake education.\nSchools are not providing students with real education,\nas that requires that each student is treated as a unique individual.\nAnd those in charge of education are too uneducated, and too greedy,\nto see how that can be easily accomplished with a cheap smartphone.\nBy presenting students with fake education, we push them into adulthood,\nwith ideas like “getting laid makes a man”, or “weed is just an herb”.\nAs a result they will make the same choices and mistakes,\nthat everyone is always making.\nThis incredible threat of being held back, or punished with a bad GPA, or bad grade,\nunless a ravenous mind is obedient, is sick.\nThe threat of never being able to get a job, because of bad grades,\nin a shitty and fake school, makes adults look like total morons.\n\nReal education enables young people to launch startups and invent new technologies,\nfrom art and software to 3d printing and manufacturing.\nReal education is what sets children free from poverty,\nfake or standardized education is what presses them into poverty.\n\nWe are such powerful thinkers, such unbreakable beings,\nwho neither fear torture nor certain death.\nThat the only way to control us, and to keep us weak,\nis to prevent us from learning for real.\nBe it by sick arrogance in modern nations,\nor deliberate attack in nations ruled by ghouls.\nUnderstand that the words Real Education,\nare sacred, and anything short of it is a disgrace.\nAnd that the future will not arrive as a function of time,\nbut as a function of real education and life long wisdom.\n\nEvery human being is meant for Greatness,\nand their Greatness is necessary to make this world a better place.\nAnytime that greatness is dimmed or temporally extinguished,\nout entire world becomes proportionally darker; we all lose.\n\nFinally, I ask that those of you who have the passion needed,\nto upgrade the Universal Declaration of Human Rights[1] to rise to the challenge.\nPlease, ensure to safely, grant all human beings the full measure of real education at no cost,\nand to aim to end poverty with an International Bank of Universal Income.\nAnd to remind all Humans, that meaning is found in Greatness Of Heart and Spirit\nas they venture towards becoming Great Beings.\nAnd that to grow up, means to grow all they way up,\nuntil we each become a Great Being.\nI ask you to begin rebuilding the world immediately, and without any delay,\nyou don’t have to wait until your shift is over, just drop it and go.\nAnd make your life about of Great Adventure,\nso that there is always room, even for the greatest of your thoughts.\nRefine it, expand it, enhance it, reinforce it, let it make you wise and powerful,\nand then make it so that every Nation stands behind it.\nMake it so that no Human Being,\nis ever denied real education.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEyMBJOKv3o",

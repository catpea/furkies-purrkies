  <p>A sequence problem, as I termed it,<br>is when one thing prevents another.</p>
  <p>And I find that people with good intentions,<br>often take to repairing problems in the wrong place.</p>

  <p>When I was little I struggled with understanding my bullies,<br>and later I just couldn't imagine why criminals do the things they do.</p>
  <p>But eventually I understood that the word criminal is wrong,<br>these are just people so stressed and pressed, that life becomes about do or die.</p>
  <p>Now, I always mention at this point, that criminals are extremely dangerous,<br>because of the state their mind has been twisted into.</p>
  <p>A really good example is a soldier, they must kill, or they will be killed,<br>they are a good person at home, but the circumstances of war make a mindless killer.</p>
  <p>And I repeat, a person who is in a warped state,<br>is extremely dangerous, do not hope for their goodness.</p>
  <p>It will take years, not months; for them to heal, and for their goodness to return,<br>that is how our minds are.</p>
  <p>We are natural born fighters and warriors,<br>this was necessary for our survival and protection of our tribes, clans, and kingdoms.</p>

  <p>To correctly approach the impossible problem of crime,<br>we first must learn how to protect people and prevent the crushing stress, that leads to crime.</p>
  <p>And once a person shows that they entered the state of a criminal,<br>they can’t be punished with prison, because prison only makes people worse.</p>
  <p>Prison may cement the state they have been put in,<br>and they may never be able to return to the person that they really are.</p>
  <p>Think of it as Forever War,<br>no return, just war.</p>
  <p>A person who entered a life of crime needs medical, psychiatric, psychological help,<br>they need many years of therapy, and understanding.</p>
  <p>By sending criminals to prison, we are attempting to fix a problem,<br>at the wrong place, and as often the case is, we make it worse.</p>

  <p>Now let me show you what happens on the others side,<br>on the side of the innocent and beautiful.</p>
  <p>Because in some places, the problem of sequence, is not an error,<br>but it is purposefully crafted to force obedience.</p>
  <p>In more than one place around the world,<br>women are denied an education, which prevents them from becoming an independent thinker.</p>
  <p>Because they are tricked out of education as children,<br>they will not have time to return to it as an adult.</p>
  <p>Such nations claim that they make the rules,<br>and it is not out problem.</p>
  <p>But a nation may only own its geography,<br>it cannot own a mind - because that is called slavery.</p>
  <p>Denial of education is how slave uprising are prevented from occurring,<br>the old saying goes, an educated slave is a no good slave.</p>

  <p>The solution to open our borders,<br>and grant these women a home, a real education and universal income.</p>
  <p>So that they don’t have to work, many of them will plan to return,<br>and real education demands that they have all the time and adventure they need.</p>
  <p>By not helping these girls and women out of slavery,<br>whatever else we do, is not nearly enough or somewhere in the wrong sequence.</p>

  <p>Here, I want to describe an induced problem that is most familiar to us all,<br><strong>fake</strong> education.</p>
  <p>Schools are not providing students with real education,<br>as that requires that each student is treated as a unique individual.</p>
  <p>And those in charge of education are too uneducated, and too greedy,<br>to see how that can be easily accomplished with a cheap smartphone.</p>
  <p>By presenting students with fake education, we push them into adulthood,<br>with ideas like “getting laid makes a man”, or “weed is just an herb”.</p>
  <p>As a result they will make the same choices and mistakes,<br>that <strong>everyone</strong> is always making.</p>
  <p>This incredible threat of being held back, or punished with a bad GPA, or bad grade,<br>unless a ravenous mind is obedient, is sick.</p>
  <p>The threat of never being able to get a job, because of bad grades,<br>in a shitty and fake school, makes adults look like total morons.</p>

  <p>Real education enables young people to launch startups and invent new technologies,<br>from art and software to 3d printing and manufacturing.</p>
  <p>Real education is what sets children free from poverty,<br>fake or standardized education is what presses them into poverty.</p>

  <p>We are such powerful thinkers, such unbreakable beings,<br>who neither fear torture nor certain death.</p>
  <p>That the only way to control us, and to keep us weak,<br>is to prevent us from learning for real.</p>
  <p>Be it by sick arrogance in modern nations,<br>or deliberate attack in nations ruled by ghouls.</p>
  <p>Understand that the words Real Education,<br>are sacred, and anything short of it is a disgrace.</p>
  <p>And that the future will not arrive as a function of time,<br>but as a function of real education and life long wisdom.</p>

  <p>Finally, I ask that those of you who have the passion needed,<br>to upgrade the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEyMBJOKv3o">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> to rise to the challenge.</p>
  <p>Please, ensure to safely, grant all human beings the full measure of real education at no cost,<br>and to aim to end poverty with an International Bank of Universal Income.</p>
  <p>And to remind all Humans, that meaning is found in Greatness Of Heart and Spirit<br>as they venture towards becoming Great Beings.</p>
  <p>And that to grow up, means to grow all they way up,<br>until we each become a Great Being.</p>
  <p>I ask you to begin rebuilding the world immediately, and without any delay,<br>you don’t have to wait until your shift is over, just drop it and go.</p>
  <p>And make your life about of Great Adventure,<br>so that there is always room, even for the greatest of your thoughts.</p>
  <p>Refine it, expand it, enhance it, reinforce it, let it make you wise and powerful,<br>and then make it so that every Nation stands behind it.</p>
  <p>Make it so that no Human Being,<br>is ever denied real education.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When I was little I struggled with understanding my bullies,<br>and later I just couldn't imagine why criminals do the things they do.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But eventually I understood that the word criminal is wrong,<br>these are just people so stressed and pressed, that life becomes about do or die.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Now, I always mention at this point, that criminals are extremely dangerous,<br>because of the state their mind has been twisted into.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A really good example is a soldier, they must kill, or they will be killed,<br>they are a good person at home, but the circumstances of war make a mindless killer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I repeat, a person who is in a warped state,<br>is extremely dangerous, do not hope for their goodness.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It will take years, not months; for them to heal, and for their goodness to return,<br>that is how our minds are.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We are natural born fighters and warriors,<br>this was necessary for our survival and protection of our tribes, clans, and kingdoms.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To correctly approach the impossible problem of crime,<br>we first must learn how to protect people and prevent the crushing stress, that leads to crime.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And once a person shows that they entered the state of a criminal,<br>they can’t be punished with prison, because prison only makes people worse.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Prison may cement the state they have been put in,<br>and they may never be able to return to the person that they really are.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Think of it as Forever War,<br>no return, just war.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A person who entered a life of crime needs medical, psychiatric, psychological help,<br>they need many years of therapy, and understanding.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">By sending criminals to prison, we are attempting to fix a problem,<br>at the wrong place, and as often the case is, we make it worse.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In more than one place around the world,<br>women are denied an education, which prevents them from becoming an independent thinker.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because they are tricked out of education as children,<br>they will not have time to return to it as an adult.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Such nations claim that they make the rules,<br>and it is not out problem.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But a nation may only own its geography,<br>it cannot own a mind - because that is called slavery.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Schools are not providing students with real education,<br>as that requires that each student is treated as a unique individual.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And those in charge of education are too uneducated, and too greedy,<br>to see how that can be easily accomplished with a cheap smartphone.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">By presenting students with fake education, we push them into adulthood,<br>with ideas like “getting laid makes a man”, or “weed is just an herb”.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As a result they will make the same choices and mistakes,<br>that <strong>everyone</strong> is always making.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This incredible threat of being held back, or punished with a bad GPA, or bad grade,<br>unless a ravenous mind is obedient, is sick.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The threat of never being able to get a job, because of bad grades,<br>in a shitty and fake school, makes adults look like total morons.</div>

Chesterton, writer, philosopher, and art critic.\nWorld Peace,\nis about wisdom.\n\nWe need a new international bank,\nan upgrade to the way individual beings use money.\nThe bank card has a daily spending limit of $100 United Stated Dollars,\nthat sum will grow with inflation.\nWhile the bank should not track debt because a Human Being is a creator,\nand not a burden.\nShould those figures prove a necessity the money can from the surrounding planets,\nthe bank, simply sells and trades land and mineral rights.\nBut it is is important to understand that this money is an investment in the future of Human Kind,\nbecause the only real thing that divides us; is poverty and all the things it induces, including lack of education.\nHuman made things such as money,\nmust always aim to help us, not hurt us.\n\nThe result,\nends poverty and wage slavery[1], setting us free to learn and become wise.\nThe effects of wage slavery,\nare real.\nThe most miserable one,\nis mass incarceration of people who are fractured by poverty.\nThe host harmful effect,\nis lack of education and growing up.\n\nEventually, you have to exit education,\nand get a job.\nAnd then, you will not learn the things you need to know to grow great,\nbecause you will be too tired from overwork, and of work, and petty nonsense.\nEven though there is no conspiracy to create wage slavery,\nyou are still being cut off from education, forced into work, and denied a full measure of wisdom you deserve.\n\nWe cannot have a justice system,\nwhen people are committing crimes our of poverty and lack of education.\nThe errors within our civilization,\nare putting people in cages - that is not justice.\nWe simply cannot have a civilization based on using poverty to force people out school and into work,\nthis is not who we are.\n\nHere in lies the problem of sequence,\nwithout real education, we can't see the errors that surround us,\nWith our love for all members of the human family stunted,\nwe can't even comprehend the gravity of the necessity of this change.\nWithout real education,\nHumanity will not notice the invisible prison walls of poverty.\nWithout real education, we will silently standby the death of 20,000 people[2],\nand in out blindness call that; a method of prevention.\n\nEntry into authentic education, and a global exit from poverty,\nis the only way to permanently prevent the fracturing, indoctrination, warping, and hijacking-the-minds of poor and uneducated people.\nOne hundred dollars per day to all,\nso that they may outgrow in wisdom their fathers, families, cultures, indoctrination, propaganda, lies, manipulations; and avoid fractures.\nLet their fathers cry[3],\nonce they understand that their children will be growing up in a better world.\nThat their children won't have to fight, or fear hunger,\nthat they can just move and take to the constellations of curiosities within them.\n\nIt is not just Universal Income, you see,\nit is also Real Education, so that the world, can see it self.\n\nToday when you ask a teacher,\nwho do they see when they look at you, their honest answer is a student.\nBut you are not just a student,\nyou are all our hopes and dreams.\nWhen you ask why they are teaching you,\ntheir honest answer is so that they can put food on their table.\nBut it is all about empowering you,\nto greatness.\nAnd when you ask them about war,\nthey will say that the world is not a fair place, that war is what men do.\n\nBut, they are victims of lack of real education, victims of poverty,\nand they are trapped within the invisible walls, of work or perish.\n\nThis cycle of blindness, destruction, and self-destruction must be broken,\nit must END right now, this second.\nIn the absence of teachers,\nyou become a teacher.\nYou must take to self education,\nbecause a standardized curriculum can't teach.\nAt best it can only churn out uneducated and desperate work machines,\nwho can't understand that only Real Education and Safety and Security can prevent conflict...\nNot mutually assured destruction, not drone strikes,\nnot another arms race.\nDrone strikes and other modern technologies\nsimply accelerated the arms race and emergence of new conflicts.\n\nHumans are not work machines,\nwhen we are allowed to grow, we grow into great beings.\n\nTake to narrated books[4],\nhelp others do the same.\nSo as long as we are learning,\nthe world education level will rise high enough to make that strange bank a reality.\nAnd the people will understand that what divided us,\nwas the fractures from poverty and lack of education.\nFreed from poverty and converging on wisdom,\npeople will begin to understand that we are one.\nOne family,\nunder the sun.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4IWpMk7esk\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_U.S._drone_strikes#Independent_estimates\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk--XN4ozr8&t=200s\n[4]: https://oedb.org/ilibrarian/100-all-time-greatest-popular-science-books/",

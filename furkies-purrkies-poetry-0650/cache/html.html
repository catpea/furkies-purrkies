  <p>We need a new international bank,<br>an upgrade to the way individual beings use money.</p>
  <p>The bank card has a daily spending limit of $100 United Stated Dollars,<br>that sum will grow with inflation.</p>
  <p>While the bank should not track debt because a Human Being is a creator,<br>and not a burden.</p>
  <p>Should those figures prove a necessity the money can from the surrounding planets,<br>the bank, simply sells and trades land and mineral rights.</p>
  <p>But it is is important to understand that this money is an investment in the future of Human Kind,<br>because the only real thing that divides us; is poverty and all the things it induces, including lack of education.</p>
  <p>Human made things such as money,<br>must always aim to help us, not hurt us.</p>

  <p>Eventually, you have to exit education,<br>and get a job.</p>

  <p>Even though there is no conspiracy to create wage slavery,<br>you are still being cut off from education, forced into work, and denied a full measure of wisdom you deserve.</p>

  <p>I was beginning my daily adventure,<br>by heading out whichever way on the I-275 Bicycle Trail.</p>
  <p>There is this one steep hill that climbs over the tracks,<br>I remember well how I had difficulty rolling all the way up.</p>
  <p>I've noticed a couple of new fitness nerds pushing their bicycles up,<br>and I got off mine as to give them room.</p>
  <p>They noticed me, and I begun complaining how steep this hill is,<br>and that I can never quite make it up.</p>
  <p>We had a chuckle, and I told them about Ludington,<br>and Nordhouse Dunes especially.</p>
  <p>I said that that climbing dunes all day,<br>is a wonderful way to lose a lot of weight.</p>
  <p>The change of environment also causes the change of diet,<br>and somehow lessens appetite, as it is a vacation after all.</p>
  <p>They, listened carefully,<br>and said that they will think about camping adventures.</p>
  <p>I might have added in that getting rid of kitchen appliances,<br>is good idea too.</p>

  <p>What I didn't mention, is that,<br>getting rid of appliances is also a crazy idea.</p>
  <p>And I didn't have the heart to say,<br>that camping or fitness vacations last a long time.</p>
  <p>Months,<br>maybe years.</p>

  <p>And so the mad idea of Adventure Fitness,<br>was born.</p>
  <p>I define it as,<br>never quite returning from a healthy vacation.</p>
  <p>This sounds more suspicions than it really is,<br>long before the dietary benefits, the Call Of The Wild comes.</p>
  <p>And though we return from that type of vacation,<br>we return as nature, not cogs in some machine.</p>
  <p>Alas, from a more poetic perspective,<br>returning changed is like never returning at all - in a way.</p>

  <p>Long before the adventurer learns to understand they must stay on their Fitness Adventure,<br>they become wild things, in the most cheerful and wonderful of ways.</p>
  <p>Artists, musicians, marvelous hooligans,<br>royal vagabonds, and of course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmmH-2rWHH0">Great Beings</a>, those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">touched by the Wisdom of Nature</a>.</p>

  <p>I am sorry I knew not to tell them,<br>not to return from their vacation but keep heading to the next and next adventure, and then some.</p>
  <p>They bravely made it up that first hill,<br>they were warriors now, and I hoped that they kept on going.</p>
  <p>I hope that today, they are healthy,<br>and appreciate that all their weight actually added to give them enormous muscles that now show though.</p>

  <p>This is Adventure Fitness, a one way road towards Health and Adventure,<br>away from stressful jobs, toxic environments, and that deadly combination of stress, couch, dinner and TV.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the first step to Adventure Fitness,<br>is still to unplug and get rid of kitchen appliances, and that dumb TV.</p>
  <p>The first step to the great adventure trails,<br>does not begin on the trail.</p>
  <p>It begins,<br>by getting rid of the appliances, including fridge and stove.</p>
  <p>And the second step is shopping for adventure equipment,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytk9jAkTuA4">starting with short and beautiful trails</a>.</p>
  <p>Obesity is a serous issue,<br>that requires Doctor's help.</p>
  <p>However a healthier lifestyle, does not mean a more difficult lifestyle,<br>as it is standing invitation to a lifetime of Great Adventures.</p>

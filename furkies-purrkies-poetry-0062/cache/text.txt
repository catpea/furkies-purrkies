If everyone seems scary,
that's only because scary is all you've ever met.
I've met them too, I saw what they can do.
How sure of themselves, how forward and blind.
But, if you spend your life in hiding,
they will win, and rob you of everything precious.
So rise, begin taking care of yourself,
and begin your search.
Not a search for mere friends,
but a search for The Extraordinary.

It is simple.
My friends.
The only way to find The Extraordinary,
is to become Extraordinary yourself.

If you got hurt before,
then you have already come a long way.
You now hold a gift of Wisdom,
a Foresight that can spare suffering.
No one is to take Love of Life from you,
no one is to rob you of Joy and Laughter.

  "text": "There is nothing good to say about the existing system of education,\nit makes students poor and it makes them feel average and unintelligent... and can at best lead to a ***** office job.\nThe concept of Balanced Education is a Lie, it is a fraudulent invention,\ncrafted to rob students of their savings or put them in debt, while obscuring the truth.\nThe truth is that a standardized curriculum cannot work,\nand lectures in college are too impersonal to benefit the students.\n--\nIt is not that hard to graduate from college and instead of celebrating, admit the truth,\nthe predatory prices, and billing, the debt, the utter nonsense of an education, and just say:\n\"I have learned nothing that has any real impact on my life.\",\nby peddling life insurance the day you graduated you are only helping the fraud, and stealing from the future.\n\nThere is something else that I've never heard anyone mention before,\nschool is slow, the entire system of things is slowing the students down to drain them of both savings and natural curiosity.\nWe all remember taking a class that we were fascinated with,\nonly to be presented with irrelevant off-topic subjects, at an extremely slow pace, suspiciously slow pace.\nIn other classes, the subjects are not divided correctly, things are out of sequence,\nThe best way to learn math is to start with P5.js - with programming.\nWhile OOP is neat, teaching Java was a terrible idea, the language has to be free,\notherwise students will be forced to pay for their programs, and what an insult to their creativity that is.\nAnd no an open reference implementation is not enough, to parade as a solution to greed,\nthe entire ecosystem must be Open Source, that should be a pre-requisite for a language taught in schools.\nIt is already bad enough that schools are charging for lectures, and that teachers are forcing students to buy self published loose-leaf trash,\nthat they artificially alter each year to prevent used book sales.\nGreed, money, has no room in institutions that claim to educate,\nto take a single dollar from a students should be reason enough for the institution to permanently lose accreditation.\n\nLectures themselves are inadequate, even something as nice as CS50 from Harvard is not enough - nowhere nearly enough,\nbecause it is not able to help students in Nepal, Burundi, Peru, Cambodia, or Thailand, for the simple reason that it is only in English.\nEspecially with today's technologies lectures should be given in all the languages,\nit is not that difficult to invite Nepali, Kirundi, Spanish, Khmer, Thai speaking teachers - and it certainly: is a Great Honor.\nA real lecture is a work of art worthy of translation into 15+ languages,\nit is free to students, and it cost a lot of money for a college to purchase the rights to.\nWhy are we tolerating a system of education that pushes subjects years away from Students,\nsome students may wish to learn programming in 4th grade, not in College or University.\nHow small minded, of us, how small minded - we are one family,\nand we are creating divisions and seeing them as achievements.\nA real lecture is timeless, universal, accessible, open, and free - like knowledge,\nhow can we charge for something meant to be a Piece of Love for all the Students of the world?\n\nIf your lecture does not inspire teachers around the world to translate it in many languages,\nthen it is not a lecture yet, it is not good enough yet.\nLectures on the subject of computer science and the art of programming are especially important to translate into other languages,\nas they introduce students to English terms, learning a common language is extremely important for the Human Family\n\nMaybe the full truth truth is, we don't have schools, our Civilization is still too primitive to build them,\nto add to the injustice of this age: a real school is yet to be built.\n\nIt is 2020 and the adults of today, wouldn't vote for Universal Basic Income for the next generation,\neven tough they have negatively impacted it, with pollution, climate, war and nuclear weapons.\n\nPerhaps it is out of jealousy,\nthat infantile idea that if they had to work hard, the kids will have to do it too.\nIt is different when we hear such an accusation at home,\nand when we go into a voting booth to cast our votes.\nWhat seems ludicrous when we raise our eyebrows on a couch,\nstill becomes reality when we cast our vote.\n\nAnd no it is not about the economy,\nbecause people don't fully understand how it works.\nEconomy is not meant to be left to it self randomly meandering to keep rich rich and poor poor,\nthe economy is meant to be finely crafted by Great Minds.\nWith each failure, they will, fix, learn, and try again,\ntemporary failure and great change is the price to pay for trapping the world within the concept of money.\n\nIt is not that we will do something that will ruin the way money works,\nis that we halve already ruined things by choking the world with poverty.\nThe use of money without the protection of Universal Income,\nis a sick idea - for all the suffering that it causes.\nThe suffering at the borders where you are unwilling to look,\nis an order of magnitude higher than homelessness and starvation.\n\nIf the children were anything like older generations, they would cancel your retirement, you know.\nSo that you had to work every day for the rest of your life\nif children have to do it, then you have to do it too - but they are BETTER then you.\n\nIt is hard to word this text in a way that is not a complaint,\nand I somewhat apologize.\nBut because of the gravity of suffering in the places that we are unwilling to look,\nwe can't be silent.\nWe are propagating very grave mistakes,\nthe future historians will examine our behavior at great length.\nEspecially now,\nwhere even the most private messages will be available to future historians.\n\nEvery day you have a choice to rise up, look in the mirror,\nand admit that the emperor is naked.\nEach day of your life can become a beginning,\nwhere you finally say \"That's enough\".\n\nAnd learn,\nand contribute small meaningful changes to the future generations:\nRestore their dignity,\nwith Universal Income where they can afford to live away from wage slavery, and choose a life of real education without a fear of going hungry or homeless, or being manipulated or frightened.\nRestore their privacy,\nwhere technology used to communicate between family is not used to create profiles that sell their thoughts for profit, violate the Basic Human Right To Privacy.\nRestore their health,\nby ending the use of toxic chemicals and whatever is polluting and hurting Us, Animals, and Earth.\n\nEvery one of us has a responsibility to Enhance And Protect Human Rights,\nto make lasting contributions that help the future generations.\nThat nobody can afford to take time off from work,\ndoes not mean that we should propagate this stupid system poverty to the next generation.\nMake your stand, use your wisdom and greatness,\nstop the mistakes that plague us from reaching the future - vote to make the world a better place for the little ones.\n(Excerpts from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights[1])\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://librivox.org/the-universal-declaration-of-human-rights-by-the-united-nations/",

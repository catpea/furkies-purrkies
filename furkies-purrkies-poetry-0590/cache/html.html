  <p>There is nothing good to say about the existing system of education,<br>it makes students poor and it makes them feel average and unintelligent... and can at best lead to a crappy office job.</p>
  <p>The concept of Balanced Education is a Lie, it is a fraudulent invention,<br>crafted to rob students of their savings or put them in debt, while obscuring the truth.</p>
  <p>The truth is that a standardized curriculum cannot work,<br>and lectures in college are too impersonal to benefit the students.</p>
  <p>--</p>
  <p>It is not that hard to graduate from college and instead of celebrating, admit the truth,<br>the predatory prices, and billing, the debt, the utter nonsense of an education, and just say:</p>
  <p>"I have learned nothing that has any real impact on my life.",<br>by peddling life insurance the day you graduated you are only helping the fraud, and stealing from the future.</p>

  <p>There is something else that I've never heard anyone mention before,<br>school is slow, the entire system of things is slowing the students down to drain them of both savings and natural curiosity.</p>
  <p>We all remember taking a class that we were fascinated with,<br>only to be presented with irrelevant off-topic subjects, at an extremely slow pace, suspiciously slow pace.</p>
  <p>In other classes, the subjects are not divided correctly, things are out of sequence,<br>The best way to learn math is to start with P5.js - with programming.</p>
  <p>While OOP is neat, teaching Java was a terrible idea, the language has to be free,<br>otherwise students will be forced to pay for their programs, and what an insult to their creativity that is.</p>
  <p>And no an open reference implementation is not enough, to parade as a solution to greed,<br>the entire ecosystem must be Open Source, that should be a pre-requisite for a language taught in schools.</p>
  <p>It is already bad enough that schools are charging for lectures, and that teachers are forcing students to buy self published loose-leaf trash,<br>that they artificially alter each year to prevent used book sales.</p>
  <p>Greed, money, has no room in institutions that claim to educate,<br>to take a single dollar from a students should be reason enough for the institution to permanently lose accreditation.</p>

  <p>Lectures themselves are inadequate, even something as nice as CS50 from Harvard is not enough - nowhere nearly enough,<br>because it is not able to help students in Nepal, Burundi, Peru, Cambodia, or Thailand, for the simple reason that it is only in English.</p>
  <p>Especially with today's technologies lectures should be given in all the languages,<br>it is not that difficult to invite Nepali, Kirundi, Spanish, Khmer, Thai speaking teachers - and it certainly: is a Great Honor.</p>
  <p>A real lecture is a work of art worthy of translation into 15+ languages,<br>it is free to students, and it cost a lot of money for a college to purchase the rights to.</p>
  <p>Why are we tolerating a system of education that pushes subjects years away from Students,<br>some students may wish to learn programming in 4th grade, not in College or University.</p>
  <p>How small minded, of us, how small minded - we are one family,<br>and we are creating divisions and seeing them as achievements.</p>
  <p>A real lecture is timeless, universal, accessible, open, and free - like knowledge,<br>how can we charge for something meant to be a Piece of Love for all the Students of the world?</p>

  <p>If your lecture does not inspire teachers around the world to translate it in many languages,<br>then it is not a lecture yet, it is not good enough yet.</p>
  <p>Lectures on the subject of computer science and the art of programming are especially important to translate into other languages,<br>as they introduce students to English terms, learning a common language is extremely important for the Human Family</p>

  <p>Maybe the full truth truth is, we don't have schools, our Civilization is still too primitive to build them,<br>to add to the injustice of this age: a real school is yet to be built.</p>

  <p>Economy is not meant to be left to it self randomly meandering to keep rich rich and poor poor,<br>the economy is meant to be finely crafted by Great Minds.</p>
  <p>With each failure, they will, fix, learn, and try again,<br>temporary failure and great change is the price to pay for trapping the world within the concept of money.</p>

  <p>The suffering at the borders where you are unwilling to look,<br>is an order of magnitude higher than homelessness and starvation.</p>

  <p>Restore their privacy,<br>where technology used to communicate between family is not used to create profiles that sell their thoughts for profit, violate the Basic Human Right To Privacy.</p>

  <p>Make your stand, use your wisdom and greatness,<br>stop the mistakes that plague <strong>us</strong> from reaching the future - vote to make the world a better place for the little ones.</p>

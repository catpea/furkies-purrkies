    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The concept of Balanced Education is a Lie, it is a fraudulent invention,<br>crafted to rob students of their savings or put them in debt, while obscuring the truth.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The truth is that a standardized curriculum cannot work,<br>and lectures in college are too impersonal to benefit the students.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We all remember taking a class that we were fascinated with,<br>only to be presented with irrelevant off-topic subjects, at an extremely slow pace, suspiciously slow pace.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In other classes, the subjects are not divided correctly, things are out of sequence,<br>The best way to learn math is to start with P5.js - with programming.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">While OOP is neat, teaching Java was a terrible idea, the language has to be free,<br>otherwise students will be forced to pay for their programs, and what an insult to their creativity that is.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And no an open reference implementation is not enough, to parade as a solution to greed,<br>the entire ecosystem must be Open Source, that should be a pre-requisite for a language taught in schools.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is already bad enough that schools are charging for lectures, and that teachers are forcing students to buy self published loose-leaf trash,<br>that they artificially alter each year to prevent used book sales.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Greed, money, has no room in institutions that claim to educate,<br>to take a single dollar from a students should be reason enough for the institution to permanently lose accreditation.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">Surely, this is a very mild winter season,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and Spring will come a month sooner just for that reason.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Therefore, we are really just about 84 days away,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it is coming real fast even though today the sky was gray.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And since this was an extremely warm year,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we can be certain that Spring really is near.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I'd say we are looking at just about 54 days in total,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and this is hard evidence, not at all, anecdotal.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But you know, as well as I do too,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">that this Spring will be a meteorological breakthrough.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So all in total, give or take a day,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">I think Spring is just about 24 days away.</div>

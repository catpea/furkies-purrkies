Surely, this is a very mild winter season,
and Spring will come a month sooner just for that reason.

Therefore, we are really just about 84 days away,
it is coming real fast even though today the sky was gray.

And since this was an extremely warm year,
we can be certain that Spring really is near.

I'd say we are looking at just about 54 days in total,
and this is hard evidence, not at all, anecdotal.

But you know, as well as I do too,
that this Spring will be a meteorological breakthrough.

So all in total, give or take a day,
I think Spring is just about 24 days away.

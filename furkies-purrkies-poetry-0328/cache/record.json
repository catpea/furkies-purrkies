  "text": "We learn to avoid trouble,\nand to have something to say.\nBy writing books, or composing audio books,\nwe become a bit more magnificent.\n\nLearning music composition,\nis a good example of learning in general.\nAbove all, our education has to be fun,\nand full of color, dance and foolishness.\n\nTell me that this is not a beautiful wisdom,\nimagine learning math with joy, lasers, graffiti, and drones.\nHow long would it take you to grok the formulas[1],\nif you could see the forces[2] with your eyes.\nTo get rid of the abstractions you only need to examine math-as-code[3],\nand then search for JavaScript and Node.js (or Python) tutorials[4], to fly the drones via software[5].\nIn all the haste you won't even notice you never leaned how to solder,\nand yet you built dozens of drones out of Raspberry Pis and various drone components.\nHow about being the first person to send an unmanned solar powered drone,\nacross the ocean, both ways, Key West to Paris, and back, and then some.\nAnd as a bonus the drone lands in the ocean as it recharges its batteries,\nand runs away from anything trying to approach it, tweeting along the way.\n\nMusic is something that is beautiful to learn,\nbecause it tickles your ears.\nFor math and electronic engineering to tickle your ears,\nyou need more than a speaker, you need boxes of old drone components, and some Raspbery PIs...\nAnd at least one project involving the creation of a huge freaking artificial albatross[6],\nwith a targeting system that could gag a mountain goat from a hundred feet in the air, with shall we say, a dielectric payload.\n\nIt is such a tragedy[7] that school is probably faking teaching[8],\nand nobody can really tell, probably because nobody knows what a real education is really like.\nI don't think it is an intentional conspiracy,\nI think what it is an emergent scholastic mediocrity.\nOne that emerges out of things like the dance of lemons[9],\nand intrinsic paternalism (whatever the hell that means)[10].\nBut all you have to do to push this mediocrity back,\nis accept responsibility for your own education, and that is something you should do anyway.\nFinally, I just want you to know that everyone is a genius, especially you,\nand that grades are fake[11] and they don't matter, they are not a judge of you.\nMaybe you could try to help the Valedictorians[12] with their speeches,\nlearn to speak out, yourself, inspire your friends accept the responsibility for their own education too, maybe launch some start-ups.\nI am not sure how serious this problem is,\nbut I trust in the wisdom of people like Sir Ken Robinson[13] and Noam Chomsky[14].\nI suspect that, it is probably time to stop memorizing and cramming for tests, and figure out what real education _really_ is,\nbecause _pretending_ to have learned, is very likely one of the major forces behind the fake schooling we see today.\nDon't drop out, don't make it easy for lemons and liars and don't let them win,\ndon't let anybody trick you out of a real education, growing up is sacred.\nFigure out what is broken,\nand build a company to try to fix it, help the world grow.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVAdqcQ4jzM\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-LfLW9Kgis\n[3]: https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=drone+coding+programming\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Vzx3BkC84\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg_JcKSHUtQ\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdNAUJWJN08\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hh6uHUx728\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmtEiOs50u0\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\n[13]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17fbxRQgMlU\n[14]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_EgdShO1K8",

  "text": "School is not good enough,\nand after graduation we still need to get a real education.\nAll those happy students on graduation day,\nhow can the schools do this?\n\nYou probably suspect that your parents are using High School as a babysitter,\nand your teachers are giving you a fake education to get paid.\nYou surely already guessed that you are being pushed into college,\nwhere you will be robbed of all your, and your parents savings.\nYes, your employer will be aware that your High School didn’t matter,\nand that the College Diploma requires little more than cramming.\n\nFirst of all you are in danger of having your education stolen,\nand being mislead in life, which may eventually lead to mental health problems.\nFantasies, empty promises, and fake education, eventually do add up,\nbut they create stress, confusion, feelings of something being wrong.\nIt is very difficult to catch on, because you don’t know the future,\nand you can’t contrast what you have with what you need.\nBiographies, narrated books, are your primary source of real information,\nand then you need to begin self education.\nStay in school, but do not let it interfere with real education,\nkeep an eye on the people that are fracturing already, tell them it is all make-believe.\nThe ones that go first are often very brilliant,\nand can make for great authors, artists or leaders.\nTheir problem is that they think they are stupid,\nsomeone needs to tell them everyone is just memorizing, and that the school is fake.\n\nToo many people are benefiting from fake education,\nyou will not stop them, no one can stop them[1].\nYou need to go around them, and give yourself a real education,\nby learning from thousands of biographies written by wise people.\nUse narrated books to accelerate your learning,\nand never make real education second to the fake one - not even for a semester.\n\nI know that design is not for everyone,\nand not everybody likes computers - I certainly don’t.\nBut at the very least, do take the time to see the full picture,\nas I hope to present it here.\nYou are self educating by creating products in the physical world,\nproducts that can be sold as 3D models where the customer may request that some company prints them out[2].\nThis means that you start with a pencil doodle and end with a physical product[3],\none that you can pass along with your design portfolio.\nAs far as securing a job goes,\nthis is the right way.\nDocumenting your design process,\nallowing people to print your more expensive products is how you get a real job.\nBut there is a problem, they will want you to have a High School and College Diploma,\nthey want you to have what has been called a “Balanced Education”.\nThese folks forgot the tests they crammed for were useless,\nand they have no idea that 400,000 Americans die each year from medical errors.\nAnd even if they did have the idea,\nthey wound's associate it with fake education.\nAs they ended up paying for it, studying for it,\nand celebrating the graduations.\nThis is why I call it a problem,\nyou have to choose real education or fake education.\nIf you get a real education by self educating yourself,\nyou probably want to find a real job among those who are self taught.\n\nI however,\nI recommend going one step beyond that\nI recommend you run your own company[4],\nand never look back.\n\nThe road to a successful company,\nis painted with happy little failures.\nFailure is the most magnificent teacher,\nto fail is the greatest pleasure in the business world.\nAs you learn more and more,\nit eventually becomes impossible to fail, but you always keep the lessons.\nFail hard, fail fast,\nrise with each failure.\nIf all else fails,\nbuild a re-combinator, a local startup accelerator that you co-found with people as brilliant as you.\nHere all the young enterpreneus in the area will be reporting ideas to key figures in the field,\nhelping each other grow.\n\nTo get there,\nstart with design.\nBuild a beautiful design portfolio,\nand begin dreaming from beginning to the end.\nTake the Blender Doughnut Tutorial[5]\nand familiarize yourself with Boolean Operations[6].\nGrab the Ender 3 version 2 3D printer[7],\nand consider installing The CR-Touch Auto Bed Leveling Kit[8].\nThis will be your on-ramp,\nstart modeling jewelry, wallets, belts and belt accessories.\nThese things may sound simple to you in the beginning,\nbut everything here is an explosion of creativity.\nWhen you sit down to something as ridiculous as designing a belt,\nnext to the 3D printer that you just put together, in front of blender.\n3 weeks into it you will master the printing,\nand create the most uncomfortable bat belt that people will buy for Halloween.\nBut here is the trick, you will continue designing all the bat belt modules,\nas a way to master Design, and make your portfolio shine.\nEventually, it will occur to you,\nthat you can build an escape kit, for safety purposes.\nMembers of the press traveling to a dangerous country,\nmay wish to pack your escape kit featuring lock-picks, handcuff key and variants, ceramic blades, and so on.\nDo you see how something as ridiculous as a belt,\neasily transforms into a small niche company.\n\nLets take jeweler for example, lion rings that don’t look fake on the inside,\nthat aren’t empty -

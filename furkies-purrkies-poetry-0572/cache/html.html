  <p>School is not good enough,<br>and after graduation we still need to get a real education.</p>
  <p>All those happy students on graduation day,<br>how can the schools do this?</p>

  <p>You probably suspect that your parents are using High School as a babysitter,<br>and your teachers are giving you a fake education to get paid.</p>
  <p>You surely already guessed that you are being pushed into college,<br>where you will be robbed of all your, and your parents savings.</p>
  <p>Yes, your employer will be aware that your High School didn’t matter,<br>and that the College Diploma requires little more than cramming.</p>

  <p>First of all you are in danger of having your education stolen,<br>and being mislead in life, which may eventually lead to mental health problems.</p>
  <p>Fantasies, empty promises, and fake education, eventually do add up,<br>but they create stress, confusion, feelings of something being wrong.</p>
  <p>It is very difficult to catch on, because you don’t know the future,<br>and you can’t contrast what you have with what you need.</p>
  <p>Biographies, narrated books, are your primary source of real information,<br>and then you need to begin self education.</p>
  <p>Stay in school, but do not let it interfere with real education,<br>keep an eye on the people that are fracturing already, tell them it is all make-believe.</p>
  <p>The ones that go first are often very brilliant,<br>and can make for great authors, artists or leaders.</p>
  <p>Their problem is that they think they are stupid,<br>someone needs to tell them everyone is just memorizing, and that the school is fake.</p>

  <p>Too many people are benefiting from fake education,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">you will not stop them, no one can stop them</a>.</p>
  <p>You need to go around them, and give yourself a real education,<br>by learning from thousands of biographies written by wise people.</p>
  <p>Use narrated books to accelerate your learning,<br>and never make real education second to the fake one - not even for a semester.</p>

  <p>I know that design is not for everyone,<br>and not everybody likes computers - I certainly don’t.</p>
  <p>But at the very least, do take the time to see the full picture,<br>as I hope to present it here.</p>
  <p>You are self educating by creating products in the physical world,<br>products that can be sold as 3D models where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV38DXv7RW0">the customer may request that some company prints them out</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JzsYcUU4Gc">This means that you start with a pencil doodle and end with a physical product</a>,<br>one that you can pass along with your design portfolio.</p>
  <p>As far as securing a job goes,<br>this is the right way.</p>
  <p>Documenting your design process,<br>allowing people to print your more expensive products is how you get a real job.</p>
  <p>But there is a problem, they will want you to have a High School and College Diploma,<br>they want you to have what has been called a “Balanced Education”.</p>
  <p>These folks forgot the tests they crammed for were useless,<br>and they have no idea that 400,000 Americans die each year from medical errors.</p>
  <p>And even if they did have the idea,<br>they wound's associate it with fake education.</p>
  <p>As they ended up paying for it, studying for it,<br>and celebrating the graduations.</p>
  <p>This is why I call it a problem,<br>you have to choose real education or fake education.</p>
  <p>If you get a real education by self educating yourself,<br>you probably want to find a real job among those who are self taught.</p>

  <p>The road to a successful company,<br>is painted with happy little failures.</p>
  <p>Failure is the most magnificent teacher,<br>to fail is the greatest pleasure in the business world.</p>
  <p>As you learn more and more,<br>it eventually becomes impossible to fail, but you always keep the lessons.</p>
  <p>Fail hard, fail fast,<br>rise with each failure.</p>
  <p>If all else fails,<br>build a re-combinator, a local startup accelerator that you co-found with people as brilliant as you.</p>
  <p>Here all the young enterpreneus in the area will be reporting ideas to key figures in the field,<br>helping each other grow.</p>

  <p>To get there,<br>start with design.</p>
  <p>Build a beautiful design portfolio,<br>and begin dreaming from beginning to the end.</p>
  <p>Take the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U">Blender Doughnut Tutorial</a><br>and familiarize yourself with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Esv8E7A4T4">Boolean Operations</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gokN9xNG94U">Grab the Ender 3 version 2 3D printer</a>,<br>and consider installing The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN5n7Dy0quk">CR-Touch Auto Bed Leveling Kit</a>.</p>
  <p>This will be your on-ramp,<br>start modeling jewelry, wallets, belts and belt accessories.</p>
  <p>These things may sound simple to you in the beginning,<br>but everything here is an explosion of creativity.</p>
  <p>When you sit down to something as ridiculous as designing a belt,<br>next to the 3D printer that you just put together, in front of blender.</p>
  <p>3 weeks into it you will master the printing,<br>and create the most uncomfortable bat belt that people will buy for Halloween.</p>
  <p>But here is the trick, you will continue designing all the bat belt modules,<br>as a way to master Design, and make your portfolio shine.</p>
  <p>Eventually, it will occur to you,<br>that you can build an escape kit, for safety purposes.</p>
  <p>Members of the press traveling to a dangerous country,<br>may wish to pack your escape kit featuring lock-picks, handcuff key and variants, ceramic blades, and so on.</p>
  <p>Do you see how something as ridiculous as a belt,<br>easily transforms into a small niche company.</p>

  <p>Lets take jeweler for example, lion rings that don’t look fake on the inside,<br>that aren’t empty - already creates a unique product line.</p>
  <p>Follow through to create a consistent jewelry line that looks beautiful on the inside,<br>as well as outside,<br>and allow orders to be made in any kind of metal from inexpensive aluminum to heavy gold - and you have a new company.</p>
  <p>Why not give away resin versions,<br>for free - that’s in expensive advertising.</p>

  <p>Every idea, and every burst of creativity, or explosion of possibilities,<br>creates more ideas.</p>
  <p>Your design portfolio,<br>is just a start, before you know it you will be building tiny companies.</p>

  <p>People are stealing your educations,<br>and are making you celebrate fake graduations!</p>
  <p>Get mad,<br>start hard.</p>
  <p>Let the 3D printer,<br>and remind you what it is like to actually learn for real.</p>
  <p>And if you do venture into the world of business,<br>rather than getting a diploma and a job.</p>
  <p>Embrace failure,<br>plan for it, savor it, and enjoy it.</p>
  <p>Because business failure,<br>is both a precious teacher of great wisdom, and a rare gem that will eventually be denied to you.</p>

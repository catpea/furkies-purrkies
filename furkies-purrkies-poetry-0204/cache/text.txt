You have to break away,
and start doing the things you love, your way.

You only grow smarter, when you add thoughts together,
and create a greater whole that makes you better.

You have to find your beginning, right now,
find a way to stop listening to everyone, somehow.

Tomorrow never comes, by the way,
come, midnight and it's already today.

Don't let life pass you by,
open your eyes, let your imagination become your sky.

Up, is the direction you have to grow,
find what moves you, and follow that flow.

Follow the lessons that you love,
make your own path of education to fit you like a glove.

Lessons can only stick together,
when you love them, when they matter.

If you don't know where to start,
download audio books to ignite your passion and heart.

Whatever you do,
don't let school and grades trick you.

All minds are equally powerful,
but our imagination has to become beautiful.

The best way to expand imagination,
is by creating a path of your own exploration.

Think about the way you learned to walk,
what our minds needed to learn to talk.

Learn from non-fiction audio books first,
it is unrestricted knowledge to make you thirst.

Then read about business, and let your imagination soar,
because a diploma doesn't get you a job anymore.

You need to choose the books and adventures that you love,
the stuff that doesn't make sense is what you need to get rid of.

Discover the wisdom behind the things you love,
step by step climb higher and above.

We are each a natural born genius, extremely smart,
we each have more than enough to turn our life into beautiful art.

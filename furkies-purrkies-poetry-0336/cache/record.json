  "text": "Above all, you need a long-term reason to learn,\nif you are not involved in a particular field, then you will learn nothing.\nIt is easy to make excuses for seemingly learning math,\n\"You won't always have a calculator on hand\" or \"By memorizing the multiplication table you'll be able to calculate faster\".\nThat makes perfect sense, but that is not math,\nthat's just calculations, adding numbers, double-checking the change you get from a cashier.\nThe simple reasons for math, have little to do with math,\nand always having a cool mini calculator on you, is pretty damn cool.\n\nBut TI-83[1], is not as cool as it looks on the surface,\nfor one it is overpriced, perhaps 10 times the price.\nSupply and demand shouldn't apply to students,\neverything used in education from textbooks to laptops must be free.\nSo cooler than the TI-83, is a calculator you program yourself,\npreferably by means of a high level programming language, maybe even a Raspberry PI Zero.\nAnd of course, you see where this is going,\nby considering to program your own calculator you are teleported on the edge of the Great Canyon of Mathematics.\nNow, every cool damn thing from Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry, Calculus, Engineering,\nto Generative Art, Antikythera Mechanism, Even Kryptos-analysis-tools and Black Hole and Big Crunch stand right in front of you\nSoftly mocking you,\nfor not being cool, yet.\n\nSure, what is a TI-83 inspired Raspberry PI to you,\nwhen you are never going to use the engineering formulas you gather.\nIt is almost a fair point,\nbut although we covered the reason for mathematics, we have not yet covered the reason for your reason.\nThough it maybe hard to believe,\nit is not enough to just own the coolest calculator in the world.\nYou aren't supposed to pursue things for their own sake,\nevery reason must have a reason.\nSo you celebrate the day you set your foot in High School or College,\nby launching your first start-up.\nCall it, Fair Instruments Incorporated, Model T-800,\nand just sell a Calculator Kit based on Raspberry PI Zero, to be assembled by the customer.\nThis is also something that requires that you get investors,\nkeep the company small, don't work hard, work smart, your goal should be to become a great being, not a mere business person.\nSo now, not only are you plowing through math to build your first prototype,\nbut you are doing it to become a business person and exit poverty, you will certainly exit the stress of poverty.\nAs a bonus you could offer a distributed social network (by wirelessly connecting all the nearby Raspberry PI Zero W/s),\nand other projects like Collaborative Audio Book Recording, or a Synthesizer Cluster for a Collaborative School Symphony Orchestra.\nYou could run a Beowulf Cluster[2],\nor build a distributed search engine, the sky is not even the limit,\nPerhaps that should be your starting point,\na Sky Net connecting all the schools together, and rebuilding education inside out by providing relevant and personalized lectures,\nYou see the importance of using High Level Programming Languages,\nand a Standard Open Operating System... there are more lessons to be had.\nBy going beyond a calculator, you leave the reality of simple mathematics,\nand enter the world of Programming, Communications, Robotics, Distributed Networking.\nPerhaps eventually, you may even design your own PI/s,\nmaybe this time with an Open 5G Hat, Aural (as in Audio) Interface, and a phone network meshing all the schools together with free internet and voice.\n\nYou don't have

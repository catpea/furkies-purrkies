will help you build a school if you are interested in such a thing,</p>\n  <p>but above all this is a system meant to change the world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It must be fully accessible to every human being on this planet,</p>\n  <p>even the 290&#x2013;363 Australian Aboriginal groups that speak unique languages.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Therefore, before a program is written,</p>\n  <p>the process must be described in a normal language that can be translated.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Once a paragraph captures a point,</p>\n  <p>a program will be written and connected to it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>For example, one may wish to ask:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Is the three strike pattern in law humane?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A program named &quot;Is the three strike pattern in law humane?&quot;,</p>\n  <p>will be created, and it can be as simple as:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>function(){</p>\n  <p>return {value: false, text:&quot;No.&quot;}</p>\n  <p>}</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now currently, a lot of people are under the mis-impression</p>\n  <p>that if someone shoplifts diapers three times...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They should lose their baby,</p>\n  <p>and go to prison.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Where prison guards in their madness and stress,</p>\n  <p>will deny them feminine hygiene products</p>\n  <p>in order to demand obedience under the 13th amendment of United States.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Our simple program, will immediately cause great upset,</p>\n  <p>you don&apos;t need to be trying to run a small city government.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This question may come up in your first start-up, if you live in a three strike state,</p>\n  <p>someone could for example have stolen and sold a laptop, and you are wondering if you should call the police.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So here, we will need another question:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Should I call the Police?</p>\n  <p>and again a program named: &quot;Should I call the Police?&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You see the importance of naming a program after the question,</p>\n  <p>if the question changes, it will become disassociated from the program, as it will have a different meaning then.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>function(){</p>\n  <p>let response = {value: undefined, text:&quot;undecided&quot;};</p>\n  <p>const numberOfOffences = await user(&apos;How many offenses does the suspect have?&apos;);</p>\n  <p>if(numberOfOffenses = 0) response = {value: false, text:&quot;No. Do not cause arrest, on first offense.&quot;}</p>\n  <p>if(numberOfOffenses = 1) response = {value: undefined, text:&quot;Use your own judgment.&quot;}</p>\n  <p>if(numberOfOffenses = 2){</p>\n  <p>if(await answer(&apos;Is the three strike pattern in law humane?&apos;)){</p>\n  <p>response = {value: true, text:&quot;Yes, as the three strike pattern is considered humane&quot;};</p>\n  <p>}else{</p>\n  <p>response = {value: false, text:&quot;No, as the additional offense will result in imprisonment. Please handle internally.&quot;};</p>\n  <p>}</p>\n  <p>}</p>\n  <p>return response;</p>\n  <p>}</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So here is a more advanced rule, that features a user call, and a sub-question.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you await user, the bot you are talking to will ask you a question, like Siri does,</p>\n  <p>it will ask you a question related to your query, &apos;How many offenses does the suspect have?&apos;.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Notice that something amazing is happening, the computer is interfacing with you,</p>\n  <p>it is asking you a question that it then transforms into a number and uses it in a calculation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It didn&apos;t know something, so it used a Human, the Ghost In The Machine,</p>\n  <p>to figure it out.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let me give you another example just to clarify,</p>\n  <p>when you need help during self checkout, when something goes wrong, from the perspective of the program,</p>\n  <p>a human will be dispatched to resolve the problem.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And one more example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk\">The Mechanical Turk</a> was a chess playing machine,</p>\n  <p>that from a perspective we need here, used a Human as a CPU.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Human Heart will forever be more Compassionate, Creative, Loving, and Willing to Change than the best AI,</p>\n  <p>we are the original thinkers and out-thinkers, we will forever be best at it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In a machine circuit as you see here, the decision making is so limited,</p>\n  <p>and accountability so easily traceable, that if there is ever any room for corruption here, it will be easily closed.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At this point, the program prefers to do nothing if there is no offense,</p>\n  <p>if there is one it leave it up to you, for example if that person is hateful it maybe an idea to file a second offense,</p>\n  <p>and if they have two offenses then the program will ask it self: &apos;Is the three strike pattern in law humane?&apos;</p>\n  <p>if the answer is yes, then the person will go to prison, if the answer is no it is not humane, then you will be instructed to handle this situation internally.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>These programs are meant to grow,</p>\n  <p>perhaps even to tens of millions of lines.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They will look into things based on age,</p>\n  <p>based on education level, based on upbringing, and even gang involvement.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Meaning that if the person that stole has been brought up in a gang neighborhood,</p>\n  <p>then they should not be punished, as they require therapy and un-indoctrination from the culture of taking.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now, listen to this.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A Judge, who hates criminals, because they have tarnished his city,</p>\n  <p>because that is what everyone else also quietly believes in his courtroom.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When he has a bad day, he stubs his toe,</p>\n  <p>his coffee is cold, and all the other things fell on his head....</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>He is no longer impartial in the eyes of Justice,</p>\n  <p>but he likable in the eyes of the city.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>He will now be removed from decision making,</p>\n  <p>he will now ask the 10 million line version of the program above, answer some questions,</p>\n  <p>and now recommend therapy, not more abuse by prison guards and more.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now, The People, which are in charge of a company, school, city, state, nation, and Earth,</p>\n  <p>will be able to re-run the same calculation the District Judge did.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Will be able to see a story of questions,</p>\n  <p>and if they find some of those questions unethical, or outdated, then they will begin a social voting process,</p>\n  <p>to change a particular line of the program.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At this point, we might as well make amnesty law more common,</p>\n  <p>and allow those who have been incarcerated under the previous version of the system, to be set free.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As it would be unethical not to,</p>\n  <p>this too would be a function call, described in the system.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Furthermore, elected officials would be automatically un-elected,</p>\n  <p>when they cross certain lines, such as failure to meet campaign promises.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As you can see, simple programs CAN fix the corruption of a city,</p>\n  <p>but they require classroom upon a classroom, school upon a school to focus on their invention.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They require the participation of at least fifty million of young and inspired minds,</p>\n  <p>the teenagers.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The program will grow the same way World Encyclopedia Does,</p>\n  <p>the petitions to change rules will work the same as the Old White House Petitions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We don&apos;t need to create a parallel system to current US law,</p>\n  <p>nobody even know how many laws they are, and many are illogical, inconsistent, if not crazy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We just need a system that is better than the courts,</p>\n  <p>a system that is better than at handling elections and ejections.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A system that grows with us,</p>\n  <p>a system that is powered by the best in us.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not for me, not for you,</p>\n  <p>but for the future, because the future requires clear decision-making, and clear and inspired thinking.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Begin studies of ES2020, and begin writing your first program with the use of functions,</p>\n  <p>or maybe the Event Emitter.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Build it for your own company,</p>\n  <p>for a school you wished you had,</p>\n  <p>build it for the city, state, nation, and the world.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Don&apos;t ask what the future can do for you,</p>\n  <p>but what you can do for the future.</p>\n</div>",

  "text": "This poem is many things; a day dream, a regular dream, a hope, a wish,\na promise, a solution and a problem, a tutorial, and a school of thinking.\nCome back to it if you can,\nI hope that it will always have something new to offer.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to limit how much damage a single liar can cause to a system,\nthat means computer programs should be used to structure a system.\nHumans will always be needed, but in a computerized automated system,\nthe amount of damage they cause can be greatly limited.\nOnce caught,\nthe system can be altered to prevent that attack vector from re-emerging.\n\nDo not fall into the trap of rule and inference engines,\nthey are a limited fairy tale, if they did work, they'd replace Linux.\nThe system architecture is simple, it is just black boxes,\nquestion in answer out.\nIt should be written in a language that runs in the browser,\nand on the server, so ES2020[1] at the time of writing.\nAvoid the Graphic User Interface,\nuse a Chat Interface, or a Conversational Interface.\nThis is what this program does,\nit answers questions.\n\nNow, this is a system that will help you launch your company,\nit will help you build a school if you are interested in such a thing,\nbut above all this is a system meant to change the world.\nIt must be fully accessible to every human being on this planet,\neven the 290–363 Australian Aboriginal groups that speak unique languages.\n\nTherefore, before a program is written,\nthe process must be described in a normal language that can be translated.\nOnce a paragraph captures a point,\na program will be written and connected to it.\nFor example, one may wish to ask:\nIs the three strike pattern in law humane?\nA program named \"Is the three strike pattern in law humane?\",\nwill be created, and it can be as simple as:\nfunction(){\nreturn {value: false, text:\"No.\"}\n}\n\nNow currently, a lot of people are under the mis-impression\nthat if someone shoplifts diapers three times...\nThey should lose their baby,\nand go to prison.\nWhere prison guards in their madness and stress,\nwill deny them feminine hygiene products\nin order to demand obedience under the 13th amendment of United States.\n\nOur simple program, will immediately cause great upset,\nyou don't need to be trying to run a small city government.\nThis question may come up in your first start-up, if you live in a three strike state,\nsomeone could for example have stolen and sold a laptop, and you are wondering if you should call the police.\nSo here, we will need another question:\nShould I call the Police?\nand again a program named: \"Should I call the Police?\"\nYou see the importance of naming a program after the question,\nif the question changes, it will become disassociated from the program, as it will have a different meaning then.\nfunction(){\nlet response = {value: undefined, text:\"undecided\"};\nconst numberOfOffences = await user('How many offenses does the suspect have?');\nif(numberOfOffenses = 0) response = {value: false, text:\"No. Do not cause arrest, on first offense.\"}\nif(numberOfOffenses = 1) response = {value: undefined, text:\"Use your own judgment.\"}\nif(numberOfOffenses = 2){\nif(await answer('Is the three strike pattern in law humane?')){\nresponse = {value: true, text:\"Yes, as the three strike pattern is considered humane\"};\n}else{\nresponse = {value: false, text:\"No, as the additional offense will result in imprisonment. Please handle internally.\"};\n}\n}\nreturn response;\n}\nSo here is a more advanced rule, that features a user call, and a sub-question.\nWhen you await user, the bot you are talking to will ask you a question, like Siri does,\nit will ask you a question related to your query, 'How many offenses does the suspect have?'.\nNotice that something amazing is happening, the computer is interfacing with you,\nit is asking you a question that it then transforms into a number and uses it in a calculation.\nIt didn't know something, so it used a Human, the Ghost In The Machine,\nto figure it out.\nLet me give you another example just to clarify,\nwhen you need help during self checkout, when something goes wrong, from the perspective of the program,\na human will be dispatched to resolve the problem.\nAnd one more example, The Mechanical Turk[2] was a chess playing machine,\nthat from a perspective we need here, used a Human as a CPU.\nThe Human Heart will forever be more Compassionate, Creative, Loving, and Willing to Change than the best AI,\nwe are the original thinkers and out-thinkers, we will forever be best at it.\nIn a machine circuit as you see here, the decision making is so limited,\nand accountability so easily traceable, that if there is ever any room for corruption here, it will be easily closed.\nAt this point, the program prefers to do nothing if there is no offense,\nif there is one it leave it up to you, for example if that person is hateful it maybe an idea to file a second offense,\nand if they have two offenses then the program will ask it self: 'Is the three strike pattern in law humane?'\nif the answer is yes, then the person will go to prison, if the answer is no it is not humane, then you will be instructed to handle this situation internally.\n\nThese programs are meant to grow,\nperhaps even to tens of millions of lines.\nThey will look into things based on age,\nbased on education level, based on upbringing, and even gang involvement.\nMeaning that if the person that stole has been brought up in a gang neighborhood,\nthen they should not be punished, as they require therapy and un-indoctrination from the culture of taking.\n\nNow, listen to this.\nA Judge, who hates criminals, because they have tarnished his city,\nbecause that is what everyone else also quietly believes in his courtroom.\nWhen he has a bad day, he stubs his toe,\nhis coffee is cold, and all the other things fell on his head....\nHe is no longer impartial in the eyes of Justice,\nbut he likable in the eyes of the city.\nHe will now be removed from decision making,\nhe will now ask the 10 million line version of the program above, answer some questions,\nand now recommend therapy, not more abuse by prison guards and more.\n\nNow, The People, which are in charge of a company, school, city, state, nation, and Earth,\nwill be able to re-run the same calculation the District Judge did.\nWill be able to see a story of questions,\nand if they find some of those questions unethical, or outdated, then they will begin a social voting process,\nto change a particular line of the program.\nAt this point, we might as well make amnesty law more common,\nand allow those who have been incarcerated under the previous version of the system, to be set free.\nAs it would be unethical not to,\nthis too would be a function call, described in the system.\nFurthermore, elected officials would be automatically un-elected,\nwhen they cross certain lines, such as failure to meet campaign promises.\n\nAs you can see, simple programs CAN fix the corruption of a city,\nbut they require classroom upon a classroom, school upon a school to focus on their invention.\nThey require the participation of at least fifty million of young and inspired minds,\nthe teenagers.\nThe program will grow the same way World Encyclopedia Does,\nthe petitions to change rules will work the same as the Old White House Petitions.\nWe don't need to create a parallel system to current US law,\nnobody even know how many laws they are, and many are illogical, inconsistent, if not crazy.\nWe just need a system that is better than the courts,\na system that is better than at handling elections and ejections.\nA system that grows with us,\na system that is powered by the best in us.\n\nNot for me, not for you,\nbut for the future, because the future requires clear decision-making, and clear and inspired thinking.\nBegin studies of ES2020, and begin writing your first program with the use of functions,\nor maybe the Event Emitter.\nBuild it for your own company,\nfor a school you wished you had,\nbuild it for the city, state, nation, and the world.\nDon't ask what the future can do for you,\nbut what you can do for the future.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oefKzjCU4w\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk",

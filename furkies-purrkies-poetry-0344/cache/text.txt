Live Beautifully,
Stay Strong.

Take to Knowledge and Wisdom,
and if you so choose, Greatness.

Make use of our greatest powers;
Authenticity, Foresight, Insight, Unbreakability...

And be mindful of our greatest flaw,
our tendency to believe in things that we are born into.

As it sends ripples throughout our lives,
even so, we must never stop rising.

Memorization is not education, school must not cause debt,
there must be no schools that are above all others, all must be equal.

Recognize that bullies are ill,
and compassionately add, to the eventual end to their cycle of emergence.

In the future, there must be no prisons as we know them today,
and the world, is not to be divided by borders.

And any and all wars,
must be prevented decades before they occur.

We aught to be taught,
to simply grow out of indoctrination and borders.

Humanity is better than its flaws,
Humanity is one family.

We are all equal, we are brothers and sisters,
one family under all the stars.

Self education, its bounty and fruits of knowledge,
and the capacity and eventual willingness to help others is the aim.

Before we, as One Humanity, agree to support things from our long past,
we must learn to ask: "Is this hurting or helping us, is this dividing, or bringing us together?".

May we all live beautifully.
in knowledge, wisdom, and in greatness.

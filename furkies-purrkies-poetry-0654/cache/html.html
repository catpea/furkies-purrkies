  <p>Wisdom is a multiplier of Knowledge,<br>and you will not learn it in a College.</p>
  <p>While it is unfair,<br>to compare.</p>
  <p>A Philosopher needs adventure and thought, not training,<br>while a Doctor must memorize without complaining.</p>
  <p>Wisdom will help a good Doctor truly see,<br>and help her knowledge grow like a tree.</p>
  <p>Wisdom is not just about knowing,<br>but learning more and more without ever slowing.</p>

  <p>Without wisdom people unfortunately make mistakes,<br>so they really need it for their own sake's.</p>
  <p>And we all need as much wisdom as we can get,<br>pursuit of wisdom is something we can't afford to forget.</p>

  <p>When I was frightened in school,<br>I discovered how a bully is just a dull tool.</p>
  <p>If they only took to books,<br>they wouldn't have ended up becoming crooks.</p>
  <p>Their mad lives had been played out countless times before,<br>and for naught was their entire war.</p>

  <p>I think this was why I early on felt that love of wisdom was important for all,<br>it sets us free and lets us all stand tall.</p>

  <p>Wisdom will also help troubled people convert whatever mistakes they did make,<br>into precious lessons, and finally give them break.</p>
  <p>In wisdom people know how to fix things without asking how,<br>and that always makes everything right somehow.</p>
  <p>Wisdom will convert self blame to self love,<br>and show that mistakes are lessons that they shouldn't dispose of.</p>
  <p>In wisdom the first book they write,<br>will set all the things right.</p>

  <p>We live in a poverty and and an overwork system,<br>there is nothing in our culture that encourages to wisdom.</p>
  <p>Just look at how people treat each other in movies and TV,<br>and you will surely agree.</p>

  <p>Wisdom however can counteract all the bad culture,<br>it will enlighten us and give us nurture.</p>
  <p>And making a mistake is not the end of the world,<br>we simply have to learn to use wisdom, and not just do as we are told.</p>
  <p>A lot of mistakes comes from wanting to be other than we really are,<br>following others so that we belong belong, or being played like a guitar.</p>
  <p>Wisdom helps us grow in our own direction,<br>and will help us see who we really are, through introspection.</p>
  <p>Just expanding into the magnificent bouquet of flowers that we really are,<br>will take us to our bright and unique star.</p>

  <p>We should really develop that magnificent thirst,<br>and look for wisdom first.</p>
  <p>Early on wisdom will help us see,<br>and set our minds free.</p>
  <p>Show us that teachers are pretending to teach,<br>the lessons they share are of little consequence and reach.</p>
  <p>That bullies are just victims of abuse,<br>living a life void of the peace that don't even know they can choose.</p>
  <p>At the same time,<br>wisdom will help us avoid it all, and help us climb.</p>
  <p>And the heights that we reach,<br>are NOT just a figure of speech.</p>
  <p>As that is the up in growing up,<br>growing all the way up.</p>
  <p>Otherwise people are merely aging,<br>putting on some show they are staging.</p>

  <p>As to a good start,<br>I think adventures and wise biographies speak well to the heart.</p>
  <p>Reading wise books that make us happy and strong,<br>will teach us class and wisdom, before long.</p>

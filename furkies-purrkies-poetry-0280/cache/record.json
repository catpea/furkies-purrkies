  "text": "Without reading powerful books written by wise beings,\nall we can really do is come up with half-baked conspiracy theories.\nDoes High School work?\nor does it destroy creativity, uniqueness, and self esteem.\nDoes college work?\nOr is everyone participating in a mutually beneficial dog an pony show?\nAre we supposed to just get a job? or or build a career?\nAnd what about Start-ups and Entrepreneurship and Invention?\nThese questions matter, if you are in highs school,\nand high school isn't working, or working out...\nThen what actually is going on,\nis that you are falling behind on knowledge and wisdom.\nIt is not that high school becomes easy or irrelevant when it is ineffective,\nbut that all this knowledge that would give you more insight into the world, is stolen from you.\nWithout that empowering knowledge;\na good grasp on the human condition, a good intuition for liars, manipulators and cheaters.\nWithout being well grounded in reality, we'll be forced into desperation,\ninto confusion, and all to easily swayed from the paths that we want to walk on.\nWith a real education, you can operate an online business,\nor write software, or become an art fanatic and illustrator without any upfront investment.\nYou gain so much support from what you can do,\nthat poverty ceases to be frightening, and you are allowed to develop further.\nIn school we face this notion of grades and GPA that somehow belittles us,\nand then we are led through a standardized education under the banner of balance.\nA musician has little interest in biology beyond what a pleasant to read book provides,\nin the world of grades it can only distract and hurt, and interrupt their self education.\nAnd yet it appears, that grades exist primarily for getting more funding,\nand they are fake, vague, and likely artificially manipulated to show progress.\nParticipating in nonsense,\ncan only beget more nonsense.\n\nIt is exhausting to try to figure all this out.\nBut think of a religious college, that puts science second to their particular religion,\nthink of a diploma mill, and all the colleges that ended up losing accreditation for questionable practices.\nThink about all the happy students, all the hard working teachers,\nall the nice ladies that made little jokes and loved the students they worked with.\nAnd consider this,\nThe most complex of lies exist not just simply for gains,\nbut also because it is highly impossible or cost prohibitive to prove wrong doing, and down right impossible to prove ill intent.\nNo university professor ever receives an email about now being able to pawn his loose-leaf \"books\" on the students,\nno dean ever asks the professors to let the students cram so that the college can keep their averages high and their accreditation.\nThese things are implied, assumed, and above all,\npart of the very foundation of a for-profit-non-profit that has lobbied not to forgive student loans due to bankruptcy.\n\nThere is only one way to answer these questions,\nand that is to listen to and perhaps read five to fifteen books on each of these subjects.\nWe must not allow ourselves to be misled into a life of un-education, and desperation,\na school that can't provide results better, than you listening to a few dozen audio-books on some fantastic adventure, is worthless.\nThe first few years after school should be about us trying to build our own businesses,\nto see is there is perhaps something better than being overworked for the rest of our lives.\nEntrepreneurship is not something that we can memorize,\nideas behind our undertakings have to come from our hearts and souls.\nWe need a real education for it,\nif school is not helping us to our independence, then we must switch to self education.\nYears go by pretty quickly when we aren't progressing forward,\nand life has a way of getting ahead of us and challenging us with complexity.\nI can't tell you is schools work or not,\nthough I am certain that education is life long.\nAnd I can't pick your books for you,\nbecause only you know the questions that call to you.\nBut I know that books and especially narrated books and video lectures, that you arrange in a sequence that agrees with you,\nand watch at the pace that works best for you, are a powerful way to gain knowledge and to step ever closer to wisdom, and without any distractions.\nWe owe it to ourselves to find books that help us away from mediocrity,\nand help us inherit lifetimes of functional wisdom towards authenticity and independence.",

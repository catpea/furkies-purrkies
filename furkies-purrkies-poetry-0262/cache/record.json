  "text": "Each day always starts with getting up,\nexcept that, in the little wilderness you can't just roll out of bed.\nAt first, at best, you roll over,\nto see where everything is at.\nAnd although you can kind of lift yourself,\nyou can't really get up.\nYou sleep on the ground,\nin a little tent.\nThat means you can,\nonly! stretch one limb at a time, and only a bit.\nA successful decoupling and release,\nrequires great gymnastics.\n\nThe first order of the day,\nis always fire, and a food item if you got one.\nThe trick to starting a fire,\nis to start with tiny twigs that matches can light.\nAnd then you add bigger, and bigger sticks,\nit is absolutely required that you do a little dance.\n\nThe second order of the day, is adventure,\nso you set off immediately.\nBring a day pack a water bottle,\nif you are not sure where you are headed, follow the seagulls.\n\nIn my case there is this fantastic out of place bench[1],\nright a top a dune.\nOne of the odd things about it is that,\nit is about a foot too high off the ground, due to dune erosion.\nTo get atop of it, you must hoist a knee, and then kind of desperately roll in to it,\nwith an intense expression, and you realize that you haven't done that since your terrible twos.\n\nUpon basking in the sun, the next order in the day,\nis troublemaking.\nOn that particular day, I've noticed two weary travelers by the parking lot,\nsniffing the leaves of a tree, that they were eagerly attempting to identify.\nI briskly walked up to them and said,\n\"Oh my god, you guys, this is poison ivy, don't touch that.\"\nOne of the older ladies started making chicken noises at her friend,\nand I waddled away.\nTo, my surprise, I discovered that this parking lot held a water pump[2],\nI had no idea.\n\nThe fourth order of the day,\nis the venerable search for a walking stick to continue the walk about.\nThis is no easy mater at Nordhouse as you can't miss the:\n\"THIS IS BEAR COUNTY\" posters printed in Bold Comic Sans all over.\nAny venture into the woods could potentially result in a dangerous standoff,\nbetween a snarling man and a beast.\n\nThe fifth order of the day, at least for me,\nis fossil hunting.\nI have my collection right next to me as I write this,\nthough they all look like gibberish to me, some of those thing are prehistoric.\nFantastic!\nIt is a long walk to my favorite spot[3],\nbut it looks like a dune valley where you are surrounded by pretty tall dunes.\nAnd here I cheerfully waddle back,\nwith a pocket full of rocks.\nBack to my camp,\neyes still searching for fossils.\n\nIn the early afternoon it is good time to set off for the gas station[4],\nhere I usually grab a sausage and a couple of gallons of water, maybe a candy bar.\nAnd the day slowly nears getting some more firewood,\nsharpening a stick for the sausage, and waiting for the sunset to come.\nAt Twilight I prepare my Audio Book for the evening,\nand crawl back into my fluffy sleeping bag.\n\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://goo.gl/maps/W5kMcSEMvZp3hEK56\n[2]: https://goo.gl/maps/JprRPGEXuuMNXfqn8\n[3]: https://goo.gl/maps/Sz1h1MygrHzHiXZq8\n[4]: https://goo.gl/maps/6DHxRYzUvH8Fdgn3A",

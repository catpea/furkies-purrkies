  <div class="paragraph">I was tossing and turning late at night,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">only to be awoken by thunder and a flash of light.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The room shook and I felt it in my chest,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but I was wearing earplugs so I didn't hear the rest.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I used to be scared of thunder quite a bit,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">then I was told if you can hear it - you didn't get hit.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I am not sure what kind of advice that is,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but it made thunderstorms a breeze.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I figured it was going to be too wet and muddy,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">to ride my iron horse buddy.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">So I resumed working on my web page,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and now I am in the finishing stage.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">When all else fails there is always web design,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">at the end of the day everything will turn out fine.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">I had to rest a bit as I switched from 8PM to 5AM for my endurance running,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">but now I feel can resume, and become even more stunning.</div>

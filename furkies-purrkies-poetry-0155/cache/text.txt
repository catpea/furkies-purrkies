I was tossing and turning late at night,
only to be awoken by thunder and a flash of light.

The room shook and I felt it in my chest,
but I was wearing earplugs so I didn't hear the rest.

I used to be scared of thunder quite a bit,
then I was told if you can hear it - you didn't get hit.

I am not sure what kind of advice that is,
but it made thunderstorms a breeze.

I figured it was going to be too wet and muddy,
to ride my iron horse buddy.

So I resumed working on my web page,
and now I am in the finishing stage.

When all else fails there is always web design,
at the end of the day everything will turn out fine.

I had to rest a bit as I switched from 8PM to 5AM for my endurance running,
but now I feel can resume, and become even more stunning.

Humanity must not be scared of poverty,
poverty is just a symptom of immature, shortsighted politics.

For politics to grow up and begin helping the world heal,
we must begin growing up, and inspire the children to growing up as well.

Nothing will change, nothing can change,
unless we begin our lives by resuming where great beings left off.

There is just one road for all to agree,
the road of Reality, Results, Knowledge, Wisdom, Excellence, and Good Ideas.

We receive a very good impression of the meaning of Wisdom when we are children,
we think of Adults as all-knowing, as always correct, and perfect.

This is our aim now, for in the absence of teachers we must become the teachers,
we must become the adults we wished we grew up with.

This is how we make the World better,
for our generation, and moreso for the new generation, and all those yet to come.

We can't hope for change,
and not grow to meet that demand ourselves.

The change we need,
is driven by Permanent Inheritance of Culture of Wisdom for all generations to come.

A Fine Culture, is self repairing, and it always heals,
it towers over forces of poverty, pain, bondage, fear, anger, hopelessness, shyness, and loneliness.

And a fine culture is what we expect of the adults that we meet as children,
once we become this culture, and the children learn that it is real.

The children will see it as an actual, realistic aim to grow into,
and they will enter a culture of beginning their lives, by resuming at the point where we leave off.

In order for Humanity to Grow,
a Central Universal Culture of Knowledge, Wisdom, and Excellence, should emerge.

A Central Meeting Point,
for all cultures that choose to leave bad ideas behind and converge on Wisdom and Peace.

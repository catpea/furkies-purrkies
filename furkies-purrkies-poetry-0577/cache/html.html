  <p>Genius is not meant to stop you or make you feel bad,<br>it is what we become when our pursuits add.</p>
  <p>When you protect your curiosities from dumb grades and broken school,<br>when you take care to be nobody’s fool...</p>
  <p>And take to adventures and narrated books,<br>making sure to avoid all the knaves and crooks.</p>
  <p>Sooner than later your curiosities will combine and become one,<br>this will be a genius invention, your joy and your fun.</p>

  <p>So you see genius emerges out of doing what you enjoy,<br>not out of a blind pursuit or some mad ploy.</p>
  <p>It certainly does not come from following somebody else orders,<br>I think that can only be a source of disorders.</p>
  <p>And it is not about going the extra mile,<br>but living that life because it is your style.</p>

  <p>You see what a terrible problem the troublemakers face,<br>they have to force their way forward and keep up the pace.</p>
  <p>People who are just dancing around their curiosities whilst having fun,<br>will have them easily outdone.</p>

  <p>If art calls to you, get a wall projector and paint the biggest canvas you can find,<br>it will be pure joy as you and art are intertwined.</p>
  <p>It math calls to you, turn every little lesson to intricate generative art,<br>it is not just about math-smart, the biggest breakthroughs come from the heart.</p>
  <p>And if you are a travel writer and need material for your tails,<br>then you have to walk the Pacific Crest, the Continental Divide, and the Appalachian Trails.</p>

  <p>You can only find genius in the things you like,<br>be it art, science, music, computers, or a long hike.</p>
  <p>When you are on an adventure that fits you,<br>your beautiful mind grows greater to expand your knowledge and view.</p>

  <p>Just like we want everyone to be able to read,<br>we have to remember that curiosities and adventures is something we all need.</p>
  <p>We can’t just go to school and let it rob us of our treasures,<br>the theft of brilliance - is a crime beyond all measures.</p>
  <p>Grades are not real, because we aren’t learning as the subjects are disconnected,<br>in real life it matters not how many useless facts we’ve collected.</p>

  <p>Just look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzjZxIaZEd4">overhead projector in your art class</a>,<br>the students are so close to perfect portraits, but are forced pass.</p>
  <p>We must not allow anybody to trade our brilliance for anything,<br>no matter how tightly to that promise of a diploma we cling.</p>
  <p>Every other art class should end,<br>with a perfect portrait of a friend.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU">Music composition is easy too</a>,<br>you just need to practice with lmms for a day or two.</p>

  <p>Genius is within us all,<br>in a way, it is what makes us whole.</p>
  <p>We have to take a step forward and create some space,<br>because we can only learn independently and at our own pace.</p>

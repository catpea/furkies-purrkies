Genius is not meant to stop you or make you feel bad,
it is what we become when our pursuits add.

When you protect your curiosities from dumb grades and broken school,
when you take care to be nobody’s fool...

And take to adventures and narrated books,
making sure to avoid all the knaves and crooks.

Sooner than later your curiosities will combine and become one,
this will be a genius invention, your joy and your fun.

---

So you see genius emerges out of doing what you enjoy,
not out of a blind pursuit or some mad ploy.

It certainly does not come from following somebody else orders,
I think that can only be a source of disorders.

And it is not about going the extra mile,
but living that life because it is your style.

---

You see what a terrible problem the troublemakers face,
they have to force their way forward and keep up the pace.

People who are just dancing around their curiosities whilst having fun,
will have them easily outdone.

---

If art calls to you, get a wall projector and paint the biggest canvas you can find,
it will be pure joy as you and art are intertwined.

It math calls to you, turn every little lesson to intricate generative art,
it is not just about math-smart, the biggest breakthroughs come from the heart.

And if you are a travel writer and need material for your tails,
then you have to walk the Pacific Crest, the Continental Divide, and the Appalachian Trails.

---

You can only find genius in the things you like,
be it art, science, music, computers, or a long hike.

When you are on an adventure that fits you,
your beautiful mind grows greater to expand your knowledge and view.

---

You should not be surprised to hear that genius is part of us all,
the surprise is that so many people think of themselves as small.

---

Just like we want everyone to be able to read,
we have to remember that curiosities and adventures is something we all need.

We can’t just go to school and let it rob us of our treasures,
the theft of brilliance - is a crime beyond all measures.

Grades are not real, because we aren’t learning as the subjects are disconnected,
in real life it matters not how many useless facts we’ve collected.

---

Just look at the [overhead projector in your art class][projector],
the students are so close to perfect portraits, but are forced pass.

We must not allow anybody to trade our brilliance for anything,
no matter how tightly to that promise of a diploma we cling.

Every other art class should end,
with a perfect portrait of a friend.

[Music composition is easy too][lmms],
you just need to practice with lmms for a day or two.

---

Genius is within us all,
in a way, it is what makes us whole.

We have to take a step forward and create some space,
because we can only learn independently and at our own pace.

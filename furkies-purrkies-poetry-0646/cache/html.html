  <p>Institutions are interested in numbers,<br>as they can easily argue that extreme abstractions and fantasies hold real data.</p>
  <p>Do not be tricked,<br>do not allow yourself to be manipulated by people who do not care about your education, but only their creepy abstract numbers.</p>
  <p>They are only interested in teaching the maximum number of students,<br>as little as they can get away with.</p>

  <p>It maybe rare that a person that senses that they were mislead,<br>hesitates with just one thing, they hesitate with everything they are asked or forced to do.</p>

  <p>Now, lack of knowledge which comes from ineffective or fake scrolls,<br>places things like UFO/s and angels, creepy religions and their armageddons, on par with fact and science - but, it is not quite their fault.</p>

  <p>This is how being manipulated works,<br>we can kind of sense it, but we can't detect it.</p>
  <p>There is a massive wall that puts on a convincing educational show,<br>with tasty raisins like the deans list, diplomas, graduations, promises of a great job.</p>
  <p>All the while teaching as little as possible to as many as they can,<br>while taking the maximum amount of money for tuition.</p>
  <p>Not just cash fees, but loans,<br>and not standard loans, but loans that cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>When cornered,<br>the principals would say.</p>
  <p>It is not possible to teach all the students a curriculum that is relevant to them,<br>so we only teach a curriculum that benefits the most.</p>
  <p>If the principal became more enlightened by the damage schools cause,<br>for example with grades where students become silenced by being tricked into thinking they are not as intelligent.</p>
  <p>If principals were shown that memorization is not in fact an education but a charade,<br>a charade that causes life long damage by trading functional and relevant knowledge for disconnected and irrelevant facts.</p>

  <p>I am sorry to be the one to deliver this message,<br>but if you are a somewhere around middle school or high school... you are almost certainly being manipulated.</p>
  <p>The teacher that is making you feel unintelligent,<br>is only doing that to keep you quiet, so that she or he can get paid with the least amount of effort.</p>
  <p>She is forcing everyone to memorize,<br>that is not an education.</p>

  <p>The tears will be real,<br>she is poor an you are cornering her, and messing with the food that she needs to put food on the table to feed her kids.</p>
  <p>The best that the principal can do for you,<br>is to feed you the Genius myth.</p>
  <p>That you are exceptional, extremely intelligent, that the whatever need you,<br>that you should grow and learn, that too is a way to keep you quiet.</p>

  <p>Some of the kids that graduate with high grades from prestigious universities,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqWnumbraI4">temporarily and thus uselessly enhance their memory, prior to finals</a>.</p>
  <p>Fake or ineffective education is such a corrupting force,<br>that for some it will translate to a lifetime of addiction.</p>
  <p>I think there a re people out there who have been promised a way to fix education,<br>only to be pushed down this dark, sometimes one way road.</p>
  <p>These kids were not born addicts, and they would not become addicts if schools worked,<br>they were pushed into it.</p>
  <p>Addiction is not just about the drug,<br>but the inability to part with the lifestyle that the drug facilitates.</p>
  <p>This is why people say,<br>you need to change your lifestyle to get out of this hole.</p>
  <p>It is because the lifestyle,<br>becomes a powerful force behind the addiction.</p>
  <p>A fake education and lack of knowledge,<br>will continue corrupting a person throughout their life, to keep the job, or the title, or impress friends or family.</p>
  <p>Again, folks who end up down this path are not born this way,<br>they are pressured by fake or ineffective education to go down this path.</p>
  <p>And drugs will not actually give them a real education,<br>just a fake GPA and diploma, from - what is from their perspective - an utterly fake educational experience.</p>
  <p>Colleges and Universities, including the brand name ones,<br>will ignore this, if they can get away with it.</p>
  <p>Because not just selling out students, but turning them into drug users,<br>makes them look great.</p>
  <p>Some schools will encourage low performing students,<br>to get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HInN7t4Zl04">treated for a disorder they don't have, with drugs that will improve their GPA</a>.</p>
  <p>None of this is education,<br>and all of it is temporary, and some of it is temporary in the worst way.</p>

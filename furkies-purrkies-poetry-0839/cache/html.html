  <p>There is a couple of interesting <a href="https://github.com/topics/visual-programming">visual programming libraries</a>,<br>of which <a href="https://rete.js.org/">rete</a> looks rather fetching, not to mention the <a href="https://github.com/retejs/rete">7.6k stars on github</a>.</p>
  <p>Visual programming can be amazing, if done correctly, and if it is user friendly,<br>and respectful towards programmers that just want to do their own thing.</p>
  <p>This is a difficult poem to write, it is not possible to explain anything in here,<br>as it would go on forever, I will just touch upon the most important parts and get to the end.</p>

  <p>The program must focus on creating JSON or data based output,<br>when a user clicks save, they will just save a description of their program.</p>
  <p>But there is an export button, and here the user can install different exporters,<br>the main exporter would be a monolithic node-modules repository.</p>
  <p>This means that the data description of the program,<br>is sent through a code generator that generates very beautiful and easy to red code.</p>
  <p>The programmers who don't use visual programming,<br>would be pleasantly surprised at the code quality.</p>
  <p>And not really be able to tell that the code was generated<br>via a VPL, or a visual programming language.</p>
  <p>See the <a href="https://yeoman.io/">yeoman</a> project for an example of converting few input parameters,<br>into working node_modules or projects.</p>

  <p>Some code generators will export for local execution, others may aim for electron GUI,<br>others still for task queue based processing, and finally auto-provisioning server networks.</p>
  <p>Auto provisioning means, system detects a spike in usage or network congestion,<br>and pays someone hourly or per second to offload the processing.</p>
  <p>This means that the network grows as needed, and when there is little usage,<br>one beefy server can probably handle it.</p>

  <p>Users must be able to create their own visual programming nodes,<br>as a side effect, people learning programming would fell comfortable in large programs.</p>
  <p>People who are opinionated about a certain way of programming will feel right at home,<br>be it the wild wild west event based programming or tidy and strict flow based madness.</p>

  <p>Finally (I told you this was going to be short),<br>users who create new nodes, or groups of nodes that combine to create reusable code.</p>
  <p>Must be able to publish their work in a marketplace,<br>it is only fair to make the marketplace free so that everyone can make their own store.</p>
  <p>Most uses will go with the central company,<br>as it is most responsible when it comes to code quality, review, and payment processing.</p>

  <p>If you were to build such a program, you may need to invite your classmates,<br>you will need co founders and friends who will work for potential payout.</p>
  <p>This is a small company idea that needs a lot of advertising,<br>if you have the patience for it.</p>
  <p>Then you certainly have a product to sell,<br>you can invite programmers to sell their nodes.</p>
  <p>Or you can contact large companies in need of custom software,<br>and show them what that program would look like visuially.</p>
  <p>And show them with great precision all the custom nodes they would need to pay for,<br>to get it off the ground.</p>
  <p>Lastly, and I think this is my favorite idea,<br>you could build the visual programming language to learn how to program.</p>
  <p>And follow up with a small company,<br>to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM">learn how to build and launch stat-ups</a>.</p>

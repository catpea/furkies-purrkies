  "text": "A sketch is a question about your source image,\nhow will it look like, how is the light, how does it scale.\nBut sketching is also a great way,\nto create many fancy drawings.\nArt, this day an age,\nbegins with a cute original photo that you took.\nPersonally I believe,\nthat cuteness or silliness is a must.\nArt is not just about the image,\nit is about the best kinds of feelings.\n\nGet an Drawing Board[1],\nand protect it from moisture.\nDrawing boards are made very light,\nthey may have honeycomb structure on the inside.\nAnd get out of your house,\nnever draw alone.\nIf you have nowhere to go,\ngo to a coffee shop.\nAvoid sketching paper\nand just splurge on the thicker 12x18 Drawing Paper[2].\nAttach the paper to your Drawing Board with painter's tape,\nor low tack drafting dots[3].\nLay down a sheet of Graphite Paper,\nthat you can easy erase with an eraser.\nAnd then apply your source image,\njust print it out on four sheets of 8x11 and attache them together.\nI used to visit an office print shop,\nand I printed out my images on large paper, but that is not needed.\nIf you don't have a printer,\nget a cheap laser printer for a $100[4].\nIt is really important that you use painters tape to attach your print out,\nso that you never have to worry about it moving as you trace.\nThe graphite paper you have left, maybe smaller than your drawing paper,\nso you may need to move that one around as you trace.\nYou will need a Graphite Pencil Kit[5] with an eraser,\nand blending stumps, which are rolls of paper that help you smear out or blend graphite.\nIt does not make a difference if it is expensive or not,\npencils are pencils, and you shouldn't pay too much.\nThe thing about art pencils is that they are of different shade or softness,\nthe #2 pencil we usually use in school is just an HB pencil, one of a dozen variations or so.\nIt is not a good idea to draw with an #2 pencil,\nbecause that is just one shade and you can't make it darker.\nArt pencils have lighter and darker colors,\nthe ones that start with H (H2, H3, H5) are harder and lighter, and the B ones (B2, B3, B4) are bolder and darker.\nI sometimes use a graphite stick[6] to fill in a lot of area,\nbut that only works well on really flat art boards.\nGraphite sticks are like drawing charcoal,\nbut a bit smaller, it is just a square stick of graphite.\n\nSometimes it is useful to get an eraser shield[7],\nespecially if you want to reflect the sun in eyes that you darkened already.\nEraser shields work best with battery powered eraser[8]s,\nwhich are kind of useful, especially when adding light to a near compete sketch or drawing.\n\nI am ashamed to say, it took me a while to figure out what eraser shields were for,\nsomehow, the thin shiny metal with curious little holes, was very mystifying to me.\nIf you want to look extra nerdy, get a Drafting Brush[9],\nto brush off eraser fluff from your drawings.\nI never had the courage to use one my self,\nbut the more I think about it, the more sense they make.\n\nThen just start tracing with a pencil, outlining large dark areas,\nmarking the reference points you may need.\nIf you don't want to draw on your print out,\nuse a Ball Stylus[10] normally used for working with clay.\nEven after I am done tracing,\nI sometimes leave the original still attached to my drawing board.\nNot just because I may need to add something,\nbut because I like flipping back and forth between my drawing and the original to see if the shade is correct.\nI call it the shading flip technique,\nand it helps you keep the tones just right.\nJust tuck the original behind your drawing board,\nuntil you are almost done.\nAnd then add the pencils, and blend with the blending stumps,\nthe big blending stumps[11] are the best in my opinion, #6 or even #8.\nAnd then mediate,\nenjoy the relaxations of art, and occasional smiles of strangers.\nIf someone likes your drawing, and you are almost done,\nconsider giving it to them, just sign it, and let it go.\nIf you are going to do that, bring big envelopes along,\nI used to reuse the ones I had my original print-outs delivered in.\nThis way the stranger won't have to worry about making them dirty,\nas they walk them back to the car from the coffee shop.\n\nYou can make a business out of it too,\nhave people send you photos of their relatives or pets.\nJust help them understand that a good photo,\nis one that looks great in black and white.\nStrong light and bright areas;\nand deep dark shadows often make for best source images.\nIf you ever get stuck,\ngently copy the shadows and light from a similar photo.\nUsing this tracing and shading flip technique,\nyou won't have a problem with proportions and tones at all.\n\nThere are very few nicer ways to spend a winter,\nthen making silly drawings at a coffee shop.\n \nReferences\n[1]:

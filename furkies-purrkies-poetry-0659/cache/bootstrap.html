    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A sketch is a question about your source image,<br>how will it look like, how is the light, how does it scale.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But sketching is also a great way,<br>to create many fancy drawings.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Art this day an age,<br>begins with a cute original photo that you took.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Personally I believe,<br>that cuteness or silliness is a must.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Drawing boards are made very light,<br>they may have honeycomb structure on the inside.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And get out of your house,<br>never draw alone.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you have nowhere to go,<br>go to a coffee shop.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Avoid sketching paper<br>and just splurge on the thicker 12x18 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CLDFNHE/ref=twister_B0842SWPS6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1">Drawing Paper</a>.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then apply your source image,<br>just print it out on four sheets of 8x11 and attache them together.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I used to visit an office print shop,<br>and I printed out my images on large paper, but that is not needed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you don't have a printer,<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-L2300D-Monochrome-Printer-Printing/dp/B00NQ1CLTI/">get a cheap laser printer for a $100</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is really important that you use painters tape to attach your print out,<br>so that you never have to worry about it moving as you trace.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The graphite paper you have left, maybe smaller than your drawing paper,<br>so you may need to move that one around as you trace.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You will need a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=art+graphite+pencils&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">Graphite Pencil Kit</a> with an eraser,<br>and blending stumps, which are rolls of paper that help you smear out or blend graphite.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It does not make a difference if it is expensive or not,<br>pencils are pencils, and you shouldn't pay too much.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The thing about art pencils is that they are of different shade or softness,<br>the #2 pencil we usually use in school is just an HB pencil, one of a dozen variations or so.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is not a good idea to draw with an #2 pencil,<br>because that is just one shade and you can't make it darker.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Art pencils have lighter and darker colors,<br>the ones that start with H (H2, H3, H5) are harder and lighter, and the B ones (B2, B3, B4) are bolder and darker.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I sometimes use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=graphite+sticks&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">graphite stick</a> to fill in a lot of area,<br>but that only works well on really flat art boards.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Graphite sticks are like drawing charcoal,<br>but a bit smaller, it is just a square stick of graphite.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Eraser shields work best with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=batery+operated+eraser&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">battery powered eraser</a>s,<br>which are kind of useful, especially when adding light to a near compete sketch or drawing.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you want to look extra nerdy, get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=drafting+brush&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Drafting Brush</a>,<br>to brush off eraser fluff from your drawings.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then just start tracing with a pencil, outlining large dark areas,<br>marking the reference points you may need.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you don't want to draw on your print out,<br>use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Ball+Stylus&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Ball Stylus</a> normally used for working with clay.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even after I am done tracing,<br>I sometimes leave the original still attached to my drawing board.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Not just because I may need to add something,<br>but because I like flipping back and forth between my drawing and the original to see if the shade is correct.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I call it the shading flip technique,<br>and it helps you keep the tones just right.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just tuck the original behind your drawing board,<br>until you are almost done.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then add the pencils, and blend with the blending stumps,<br>the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=big+blending+stumps&dc&ref=a9_sc_1">big blending stumps</a> are the best in my opinion, #6 or even #8.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And then mediate,<br>enjoy the relaxations of art, and occasional smiles of strangers.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If someone likes your drawing, and you are almost done,<br>consider giving it to them, just sign it, and let it go.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you are going to do that, bring big envelopes along,<br>I used to reuse the ones I had my original print-outs delivered in.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This way the stranger won't have to worry about making them dirty,<br>as they walk them back to the car from the coffee shop.</div>

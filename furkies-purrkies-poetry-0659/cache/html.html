  <p>A sketch is a question about your source image,<br>how will it look like, how is the light, how does it scale.</p>
  <p>But sketching is also a great way,<br>to create many fancy drawings.</p>
  <p>Art this day an age,<br>begins with a cute original photo that you took.</p>
  <p>Personally I believe,<br>that cuteness or silliness is a must.</p>
  <p>Art is not just about the image,<br>it is about the best kinds of feelings.</p>

  <p>Get an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=art+drawing+drafting+board">Drawing Board</a>,<br>and protect it from moisture.</p>
  <p>Drawing boards are made very light,<br>they may have honeycomb structure on the inside.</p>
  <p>And get out of your house,<br>never draw alone.</p>
  <p>If you have nowhere to go,<br>go to a coffee shop.</p>
  <p>Avoid sketching paper<br>and just splurge on the thicker 12x18 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CLDFNHE/ref=twister_B0842SWPS6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1">Drawing Paper</a>.</p>
  <p>Attach the paper to your Drawing Board with painter's tape,<br>or low tack <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Drafting+Dots">drafting dots</a>.</p>
  <p>Lay down a sheet of Graphite Paper,<br>that you can easy erase with an eraser.</p>
  <p>And then apply your source image,<br>just print it out on four sheets of 8x11 and attache them together.</p>
  <p>I used to visit an office print shop,<br>and I printed out my images on large paper, but that is not needed.</p>
  <p>If you don't have a printer,<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brother-HL-L2300D-Monochrome-Printer-Printing/dp/B00NQ1CLTI/">get a cheap laser printer for a $100</a>.</p>
  <p>It is really important that you use painters tape to attach your print out,<br>so that you never have to worry about it moving as you trace.</p>
  <p>The graphite paper you have left, maybe smaller than your drawing paper,<br>so you may need to move that one around as you trace.</p>
  <p>You will need a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=art+graphite+pencils&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">Graphite Pencil Kit</a> with an eraser,<br>and blending stumps, which are rolls of paper that help you smear out or blend graphite.</p>
  <p>It does not make a difference if it is expensive or not,<br>pencils are pencils, and you shouldn't pay too much.</p>
  <p>The thing about art pencils is that they are of different shade or softness,<br>the #2 pencil we usually use in school is just an HB pencil, one of a dozen variations or so.</p>
  <p>It is not a good idea to draw with an #2 pencil,<br>because that is just one shade and you can't make it darker.</p>
  <p>Art pencils have lighter and darker colors,<br>the ones that start with H (H2, H3, H5) are harder and lighter, and the B ones (B2, B3, B4) are bolder and darker.</p>
  <p>I sometimes use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=graphite+sticks&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">graphite stick</a> to fill in a lot of area,<br>but that only works well on really flat art boards.</p>
  <p>Graphite sticks are like drawing charcoal,<br>but a bit smaller, it is just a square stick of graphite.</p>

  <p>Sometimes it is useful to get an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=eraser+shiled&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">eraser shield</a>,<br>especially if you want to reflect the sun in eyes that you darkened already.</p>
  <p>Eraser shields work best with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=batery+operated+eraser&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">battery powered eraser</a>s,<br>which are kind of useful, especially when adding light to a near compete sketch or drawing.</p>

  <p>I am ashamed to say, it took me a while to figure out what eraser shields were for,<br>somehow, the thin shiny metal with curious little holes, was very mystifying to me.</p>
  <p>If you want to look extra nerdy, get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=drafting+brush&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Drafting Brush</a>,<br>to brush off eraser fluff from your drawings.</p>
  <p>I never had the courage to use one my self,<br>but the more I think about it, the more sense they make.</p>

  <p>Then just start tracing with a pencil, outlining large dark areas,<br>marking the reference points you may need.</p>
  <p>If you don't want to draw on your print out,<br>use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Ball+Stylus&ref=nb_sb_noss_2">Ball Stylus</a> normally used for working with clay.</p>
  <p>Even after I am done tracing,<br>I sometimes leave the original still attached to my drawing board.</p>
  <p>Not just because I may need to add something,<br>but because I like flipping back and forth between my drawing and the original to see if the shade is correct.</p>
  <p>I call it the shading flip technique,<br>and it helps you keep the tones just right.</p>
  <p>Just tuck the original behind your drawing board,<br>until you are almost done.</p>
  <p>And then add the pencils, and blend with the blending stumps,<br>the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=big+blending+stumps&dc&ref=a9_sc_1">big blending stumps</a> are the best in my opinion, #6 or even #8.</p>
  <p>And then mediate,<br>enjoy the relaxations of art, and occasional smiles of strangers.</p>
  <p>If someone likes your drawing, and you are almost done,<br>consider giving it to them, just sign it, and let it go.</p>
  <p>If you are going to do that, bring big envelopes along,<br>I used to reuse the ones I had my original print-outs delivered in.</p>
  <p>This way the stranger won't have to worry about making them dirty,<br>as they walk them back to the car from the coffee shop.</p>

  <p>You can make a business out of it too,<br>have people send you photos of their relatives or pets.</p>
  <p>Just help them understand that a good photo,<br>is one that looks great in black and white.</p>
  <p>Strong light and bright areas;<br>and deep dark shadows often make for best source images.</p>
  <p>If you ever get stuck,<br>gently copy the shadows and light from a similar photo.</p>
  <p>Using this tracing and shading flip technique,<br>you won't have a problem with proportions and tones at all.</p>

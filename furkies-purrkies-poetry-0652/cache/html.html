  <p>Perhaps bicycling on ice,<br>isn't always nice.</p>
  <p>But if there is some snow,<br>then you should totally give it a go.</p>
  <p>Just get a backpack and a thermos of tea,<br>and set yourself free.</p>

  <p>And if bicycling is something you don't like,<br>then get a fat tire bike.</p>
  <p>They are not as wobbly and iffy,<br>and still take you anywhere in a jiffy.</p>
  <p>They will push all the snow aside,<br>and won't slip and slide.</p>

  <p>It is amazing to ride into the snow,<br>especially if you go slow.</p>
  <p>And have some crackers and cheese on hand,<br>riding winters feels like discovering new land.</p>
  <p>And you know...<br>you can wear short sleeves if you bicycle in snow.</p>

  <p>To make your ride even more fun,<br>get a wide seat before your run.</p>
  <p>And just in case brings some gloves along,<br>especially if your adventure will run long.</p>
  <p>You are sure to find others riding too,<br>it is rare to be the first one to plow through.</p>

  <p>I happen to live near the I-275 bicycle trail,<br>and have great adventures without a fail.</p>
  <p>Though I did fall a time or two,<br>riding in the snow is something I always look forward to.</p>
  <p>I am sure you too have a trail that runs near,<br>so <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/?k=fat+tire+bikes">get a fat tire bike and ride with no fear</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics">Svelte is a nice example</a>,<br>as it is simple and it comes with a neat tutorial.</p>
  <p><a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js has a step-by-step tutorial too</a>,<br><a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">the react tutorial is a bit insane</a>.</p>
  <p>There is no one to make you hurry,<br>or stand over you.</p>
  <p>By learning bits of programming,<br>you begin remembering that you are smart.</p>

  <p>Schools trick us into thinking,<br>that we are only as good as our grades.</p>
  <p>And programming can remind us,<br>we are just as good as aaaall the smart people.</p>
  <p>The tutorials,<br>show what real education is like.</p>

  <p>The speed at which you learn,<br>is influenced by what you know.</p>
  <p>The more you know,<br>the more carefully you go.</p>
  <p>It maybe easy,<br>to memorize everything on day one.</p>
  <p>But it is not good,<br>because you have to dream.</p>
  <p>You have to dream everything up,<br>you have to build scaffolds in your mind.</p>

  <p>Today, often programming starts with the web page,<br>and Svelte shows you everything step by step.</p>
  <p>Especially when they show you a reactive button,<br>in section 2, under Reactivity / Assignments.</p>

  <p>It wouldn't be too hard to explain math this way,<br><a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">computer math is amazing</a>, everything is always moving.</p>
  <p>Sigma summation is my favorite example,<br>and you should get angry.</p>
  <p>Teachers preoccupied you with trivial math,<br>where there were entire worlds to discover.</p>

  <p>Here, all the boring calculations are done for you,<br>and you day dream in radians of the unit circle.</p>
  <p>First you reinvent vectors,<br>so that you paint, what you wan to paint.</p>
  <p>And then when you get tired of painting,<br>you reinvent magnets or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAJkLh76QnM">attractors</a>.</p>

  <p>Just like there is no limit to your intelligence,<br>when you explore on your own and learn for real.</p>

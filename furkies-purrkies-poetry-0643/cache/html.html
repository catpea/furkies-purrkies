  <p>Many will say that it is not possible to become an artist,<br>without the mastery of color - this is not true.</p>
  <p>The early painters experienced this,<br>sometimes they'd start with a black and white painting.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipf3_sXts_o">And then glaze</a>,<br>with a see trough transparent color over the parts that needed it.</p>
  <p>So in that way, the Art Masters,<br>would finish the painting before adding color.</p>

  <p>There are two things to consider,<br>mixing color, and creating a color theme.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kutBRWFcTpE">It is one thing to try to match a rose pedal</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhLq1M13TUE">with a tiny little bit of practice that becomes really easy</a>.</p>
  <p>Just be mindful that the secondary color you create,<br>is always a mix of the two primaries.</p>
  <p>Free your mind by arranging a color wheel on your palette,<br>yes you know how to make a green, but keep it organized.</p>
  <p>To de-saturate a color,<br>mix it with the opposite on the color wheel.</p>
  <p>You are attacking the color with the colors across,<br>and it will fade, color sin nature are never fully saturated.</p>
  <p>When the color is attacked then the primaries are at it,<br>you will have a dark mix, so always have your white ready to increase the brightness.</p>

  <p>But sometimes what you think you want,<br>only seems like a good idea.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, in the complexity of your painting,<br>you will lose the harmony, the song, the opera, the clarity of expression.</p>
  <p>An you will end up with multiple color themes in one painting,<br>all wondering what is going on, and feeling lost.</p>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa">Look behind Mona Lisa, that is a color theme</a>,<br>it belongs in the background, and it stays there.</p>
  <p>Mona Lisa has two layers,<br>the background and the portrait.</p>
  <p>Each layer has a separate color theme,<br>and the two themes are not angry with each other.</p>
  <p>If you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa_(Prado)">Mona Lisa from Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain</a>,<br>oh boy, the outrageous red of her selves and the wrong blue of the sky are flirting, scandalous!</p>
  <p>And let me just say,<br>it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51UoNyqi9Ao">NÖÖÖT! a good idea to restore the background and to a color that is so obviously wrong</a> - I am sorry.</p>
  <p>They ruined a Mona Lisa, probably a Leonardo,<br>possibly recovering an underlying experiment with longevity of glazes... and called it restoration.</p>
  <p>This is not a harmonious color theme,<br>it is all wrong.</p>
  <p>(If anybody who ruined that painting is listening to this poem,<br>please stop now, you do not want to hear what I am about to say.)</p>

  <p>You see, the color a painting, is the second work of art,<br>the color <a href="https://coolors.co/palettes/trending">palette</a>, <a href="https://colorhunt.co/palettes/cream">scheme</a>, <a href="https://color.adobe.com/explore">theme</a> or <a href="https://colornames.org/fresh/">swatch</a>, whatever you wish to call it.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c57qq2nE3B0">I recently saw an artist create a beautiful thing</a>,<br>and I noticed what he was doing for color.</p>
  <p>Neon Pastel Theme,<br>he wouldn't date to even think about picking a color from another palette.</p>
  <p>And we should learn from him,<br>there are plenty of celebrated color palettes out there.</p>
  <p>If you create your art in a specific palette,<br>or re-color your source image with he colors from the palette you like, you are all set.</p>
  <p>And if eyes need a glow, magical richness,<br>it is OK to add a custom color, though it will stick out.</p>

  <p>This of course bring us back mixing colors,<br>because whatever palette you picked...</p>
  <p>And looooong before you even look at you canvas,<br>you have to spend a day or two mixing.</p>
  <p>Let me underline the gravity of this step for you,<br>because I did not have anyone underline colors for me.</p>

  <p>Once you pick your palette,<br>and recolor your source image, perhaps on a computer.</p>
  <p>You then need to make a trip to your dollar store,<br>and look for cute little glass jars.</p>
  <p>Because, mirroring a palette by mixing your own colors,<br>create a little treasure.</p>
  <p>Ten or so little jars,<br>full of the colors you picked.</p>
  <p>A color palette that you like,<br>is your friend.</p>
  <p>It is completely understandable if not downright lovely,<br>if you pick subjects because they match your favorite palette.</p>
  <p>But of course you can have many such color collections,<br>a palette for portraits, a palette for snow.</p>
  <p>Once you are done mixing you then place your little jars,<br>into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes">1980's vintage cupboard you found while thrifting</a>.</p>
  <p>If anybody asks,<br>you cross your arms in deep thought and say "Those are my colors."</p>

  <p>Do you see,<br>colors live a life that is separate from your paintings.</p>
  <p>Colors,<br>are an art in it self.</p>
  <p>It is a little know fact that color palettes call to their artists,<br>to make them create even more art.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Many will say that it is not possible to become an artist,<br>without the mastery of color - this is not true.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The early painters experienced this,<br>sometimes they'd start with a black and white painting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipf3_sXts_o">And then glaze</a>,<br>with a see trough transparent color over the parts that needed it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So in that way, the Art Masters,<br>would finish the painting before adding color.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kutBRWFcTpE">It is one thing to try to match a rose pedal</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhLq1M13TUE">with a tiny little bit of practice that becomes really easy</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just be mindful that the secondary color you create,<br>is always a mix of the two primaries.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Free your mind by arranging a color wheel on your palette,<br>yes you know how to make a green, but keep it organized.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To de-saturate a color,<br>mix it with the opposite on the color wheel.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You are attacking the color with the colors across,<br>and it will fade, color sin nature are never fully saturated.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When the color is attacked then the primaries are at it,<br>you will have a dark mix, so always have your white ready to increase the brightness.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Sometimes, in the complexity of your painting,<br>you will lose the harmony, the song, the opera, the clarity of expression.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">An you will end up with multiple color themes in one painting,<br>all wondering what is going on, and feeling lost.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Each layer has a separate color theme,<br>and the two themes are not angry with each other.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa_(Prado)">Mona Lisa from Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain</a>,<br>oh boy, the outrageous red of her selves and the wrong blue of the sky are flirting, scandalous!</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And let me just say,<br>it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51UoNyqi9Ao">NÖÖÖT! a good idea to restore the background and to a color that is so obviously wrong</a> - I am sorry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They ruined a Mona Lisa, probably a Leonardo,<br>possibly recovering an underlying experiment with longevity of glazes... and called it restoration.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is not a harmonious color theme,<br>it is all wrong.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you create your art in a specific palette,<br>or re-color your source image with he colors from the palette you like, you are all set.</div>

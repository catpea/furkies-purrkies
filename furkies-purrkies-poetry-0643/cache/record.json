  "text": "Many will say that it is not possible to become an artist,\nwithout the mastery of color - this is not true.\nThe early painters experienced this,\nsometimes they'd start with a black and white painting.\nAnd then glaze[1],\nwith a see trough transparent color over the parts that needed it.\nSo in that way, the Art Masters,\nwould finish the painting before adding color.\n\nThere are two things to consider,\nmixing color, and creating a color theme.\nIt is one thing to try to match a rose pedal[2],\nwith a tiny little bit of practice that becomes really easy[3].\nJust be mindful that the secondary color you create,\nis always a mix of the two primaries.\nFree your mind by arranging a color wheel on your palette,\nyes you know how to make a green, but keep it organized.\nTo de-saturate a color,\nmix it with the opposite on the color wheel.\nYou are attacking the color with the colors across,\nand it will fade, color sin nature are never fully saturated.\nWhen the color is attacked then the primaries are at it,\nyou will have a dark mix, so always have your white ready to increase the brightness.\n\nBut sometimes what you think you want,\nonly seems like a good idea.\nSometimes, in the complexity of your painting,\nyou will lose the harmony, the song, the opera, the clarity of expression.\nAn you will end up with multiple color themes in one painting,\nall wondering what is going on, and feeling lost.\nLook behind Mona Lisa, that is a color theme[4],\nit belongs in the background, and it stays there.\nMona Lisa has two layers,\nthe background and the portrait.\nEach layer has a separate color theme,\nand the two themes are not angry with each other.\nIf you look at the Mona Lisa from Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain[5],\noh boy, the outrageous red of her selves and the wrong blue of the sky are flirting, scandalous!\nAnd let me just say,\nit was NÖÖÖT! a good idea to restore the background and to a color that is so obviously wrong[6] - I am sorry.\nThey ruined a Mona Lisa, probably a Leonardo,\npossibly recovering an underlying experiment with longevity of glazes... and called it restoration.\nThis is not a harmonious color theme,\nit is all wrong.\n(If anybody who ruined that painting is listening to this poem,\nplease stop now, you do not want to hear what I am about to say.)\n\nYou see, the color a painting, is the second work of art,\nthe color palette[7], scheme[8], theme[9] or swatch[10], whatever you wish to call it.\n\nI recently saw an artist create a beautiful thing[11],\nand I noticed what he was doing for color.\nNeon Pastel Theme,\nhe wouldn't date to even think about picking a color from another palette.\nAnd we should learn from him,\nthere are plenty of celebrated color palettes out there.\nIf you create your art in a specific palette,\nor re-color your source image with he colors from the palette you like, you are all set.\nAnd if eyes need a glow, magical richness,\nit is OK to add a custom color, though it will stick out.\n\nThis of course bring us back mixing colors,\nbecause whatever palette you picked...\nAnd looooong before you even look at you canvas,\nyou have to spend a day or two mixing.\nLet me underline the gravity of this step for you,\nbecause I did not have anyone underline colors for me.\n\nOnce you pick your palette,\nand recolor your source image, perhaps on a computer.\nYou then need to make a trip to your dollar store,\nand look for cute little glass jars.\nBecause, mirroring a palette by mixing your own colors,\ncreate a little treasure.\nTen or so little jars,\nfull of the colors you picked.\nA color palette that you like,\nis your friend.\nIt is completely understandable if not downright lovely,\nif you pick subjects because they match your favorite palette.\nBut of course you can have many such color collections,\na palette for portraits, a palette for snow.\nOnce you are done mixing you then place your little jars,\ninto a 1980's vintage cupboard you found while thrifting[12].\nIf anybody asks,\nyou cross your arms in deep thought and say \"Those are my colors.\"\n\nDo you see,\ncolors live a life that is separate from your paintings.\nColors,\nare an art in it self.\nIt is a little know fact that color palettes call to their artists,\nto make them create even more art.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipf3_sXts_o\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kutBRWFcTpE\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhLq1M13TUE\n[4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa\n[5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa_(Prado)\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51UoNyqi9Ao\n[7]: https://coolors.co/palettes/trending\n[8]: https://colorhunt.co/palettes/cream\n[9]: https://color.adobe.com/explore\n[10]: https://colornames.org/fresh/\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c57qq2nE3B0\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes",

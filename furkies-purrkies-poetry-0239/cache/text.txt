You can't finish by simply getting to the end,
if you don't start in the beginning.

We learn a new language out there,
the edge grants us a new vocabulary.

A vocabulary, is also an aid for thinking,
it helps us navigate better.

And the edge is a sacred place,
there you can quietly comprehend what all Great Beings speak of.

And, it becomes your anchor,
the thing that makes sense.

it becomes the point from which you measure other things,
as you progress forward.

And, Look who else is here,
the Elder You.

They all come here, at every plateau, in each great loneliness,
ask them what their regrets are, and prevent them all from occurring.

The edge is a sacred place,
you are always safe out here, you are always welcome, and you are never alone.

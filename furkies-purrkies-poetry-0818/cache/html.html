  <p>I just figured out how to identify locations of parts of a cube,<br>you have to <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/mesh/mesh_to_points.html">create a point cloud around the cube</a>.</p>
  <p>A point is a really primitive idea,<br>and it does not show up in the finished product.</p>
  <p>But it serves as a very valuable anchor,<br>a point is just X,Y and Z, also called a vector.</p>
  <p>And Geometry Nodes,<br>are all about vectors.</p>
  <p>Just to clarify, a point can’t help you manipulate the cube,<br>it is just a thing that gets glued on top of the cube.</p>
  <p>It is a useful concept,<br>for attaching things to a cube.</p>
  <p>You don’t have to calculate the vector or XYZ,<br>of the center of the face of a cube, because you can put a point there.</p>
  <p>And if you resize the cube,<br>by giving it new dimensions that point will update its XYZ, or vector.</p>

  <p>When I was making the Superhero belt hinge,<br>I used a curve line - another invisible primitive.</p>
  <p>It is basically the string of a necklace,<br>there you say what you want on it.</p>
  <p>It came as a bit of a surprise to me,<br>that unlike the more complex and visible meshes...</p>
  <p>The line asked for the start point and end point,<br>it asked for the two vectors that edges of a cube have.</p>
  <p>That is really convenient,<br>because the Mesh to Points Node delivers exactly that.</p>
  <p>The points or XYZ vectors, have an ID number,<br>that I have to locate by hand, but that is OK.</p>
  <p>I wrap my initial cube operations in a Group,<br>or a custom cube component.</p>
  <p>And this allows me to give it custom properties,<br>so here I can create.</p>
  <p>Start Of Bottom Hinge and End of Bottom Hinge,<br>and Start Of Top Hinge, and End Of Top Hinge.</p>
  <p>And this will return the four Vectors,<br>that I will then feed into my hinge creation group.</p>

  <p>Being able to select parts of a cube,<br>is a huge deal for creating objects for 3D printing.</p>
  <p>It is a huge deal for programming 3D geometry,<br>the Point Cloud, is basically the mouse.</p>
  <p>The mouse that is no longer available to you,<br>because you are no longer editing an object.</p>
  <p>But programming one,<br>so you can’t really click on it.</p>

  <p>Just to clarify, normally 3D cube,<br>is represented by three categories of things.</p>
  <p>Vertices which mark the corners,<br>edge-lines, which connect the vertices together in the correct way to make a kind of a wire-frame.</p>
  <p>And then faces,<br>which specify what parts of the wire-frame are filled.</p>
  <p>If you wanted to move a corner of a cube up,<br>you don’t worry about the lines or face.</p>
  <p>You just move the vertex,<br>and the edge-lines and faces recalculate.</p>
  <p>If you wanted to move the lower side of a cube,<br>to make a primitive shoe shape, you move the edge-line connecting the vertices.</p>
  <p>So that you don’t have to worry about aligning the vertices,<br>moving the edge-line will take care of that for you, and update the face.</p>
  <p>If you want to stretch a cube upwards,<br>you just grab the face and pull up.</p>
  <p>This will move all four vertices,<br>and all four edge-lines for you.</p>
  <p>Vertices, Edges, and Faces,<br>represent a useful concept for operating on 3D geometry.</p>

  <p>When you are programming a cube,<br>all these concepts still apply.</p>
  <p>But you don’t really model a cube,<br>you create one with the correct dimensions.</p>
  <p>To adjust things that go on top of a cube,<br>you may use a point cloud.</p>
  <p>This will cause your additions to automatically move,<br>when you change the cube, because points mark abstract areas on a cube.</p>
  <p>They can be glues to the middle of a face,<br>the middle of an edge line, or exactly where the vertex is.</p>

  <p>To programmatically make a cube change its size,<br>based on what I know, at this time in Blender’s development.</p>
  <p>You can only address a vertex or the corners of a cube,<br>so if you want to pull the top of a cube up.</p>
  <p>You have to know the index numbers of all four vertices,<br>it is probably, 0,1,2,3 for the bottom, and 4,5,6,7 for top.</p>
  <p>But I suspect in the future version of Blender,<br>you will be able to reference faces and edges.</p>
  <p>It really simplifies the Math,<br>and makes the graph tree, the visual programming much more readable.</p>

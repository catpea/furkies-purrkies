Oh, much can be said,
of what one thinks today,
and another tomorrow morning.
But, the world belongs,
to all the future generations,
we are just temporary residents.
We are not to treat Earth,
as if it only belonged to us.

We are to stop lying to children,
that memorization is education.

We are to stop keeping in them in rows,
dividing time into squares,
and subjects into meaninglessness,
in a one-for-all curriculum of poverty of mind.
Respect, is a reward, so don't demand it,
it is not a demand anybody can make.

And we are to stop thinking in short term,
rather than keeping ten million people in cages,
we need to practice Crime Prevention and put an End to Poverty first.
Rather than economic fairy-tales,
mutually assured destruction, and blind wars,
we need to connect together across borders and in wisdom.

There is very little prestige to be gained,
from hard work and beautiful career, tailored suits,
and expensive cafes if we are not paying attention to all the problems children face.

That's just reality, the respect of the younger generations cannot be granted for free,
children can't believe nonsense no matter how convincing the teachers,
and the world won't grow without Wisdom.

The world will wait,
for several consecutive generations of Wise Beings,
to converge on good ideas, in Peace and Earned Respect.
It will wait.
It need not be hard work, you know,
reading books or listening to audio books comes so easy,
and there is so much we learn - we inherit lifetimes of knowledge.

Though it is Beautiful, and Healing, and Wonderful,
Wisdom is not just for us, it is for all the future.

Many of the problems that overwhelm us,
really can't be repaired, the career politicians are lying.
The big problems,
can only be prevented with Foresight, and Love, and Wisdom,
and require hard work by multiple generations

And that can only begin with Real Education,
and Real Love of Wisdom.

Please rise to the challenge,
and become a great being.

  <p>I know you are going to laugh,<br>but let me say it anyway.</p>
  <p>The locomotive horn,<br>has been bulling me since third grade.</p>
  <p>There were trains by my <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/hwiwrdjNskkbxDNr6">Grandma's in Wroclaw</a>,<br>so I heard the horn way before.</p>
  <p>But, it wasn't until <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ygFsopnd1HrA7zkFA">I moved closer to the trains</a> in third grade,<br>that I found I had quite enough - thank you.</p>

  <p>I was out on a run,<br>just doing an extra tail end before finishing.</p>
  <p>Couple of minutes after I crossed the tracks,<br>I heard the train horn behind me.</p>
  <p>But, I didn't think much of it,<br>I just kept running.</p>
  <p>I felt a little warm glow about me,<br>my biceps were giving away heat.</p>
  <p>I was carrying 10lb. in each arm,<br>I didn't ache, I wasn't tired.</p>
  <p>If that changes in the Summer,<br>if it is the cold that makes me so strong.</p>
  <p>Oh, I am going to write a poem then,<br>like no tomorrow.</p>

  <p>As I was nearing the highway,<br>the city lamps ended.</p>
  <p>And it got pleasantly dark,<br>I put my headlamp on and lit the path.</p>
  <p>I was just three miles in,<br>though it took forever, and half - two hours to be precise.</p>
  <p>I <strong>will</strong> improve my pace,<br>I am just having too much fun right now.</p>
  <p>I made it to the western end of my trail,<br>and gracefully did a little loop-de-loop to run back.</p>

  <p>I find it is when you do a 180,<br>you often discover that you have been running with the wind.</p>
  <p>And now you flip the pancake,<br>the side that was used to being hidden from the wind will now face it - Ouch.</p>
  <p>In less than five minutes,<br>I pulled up my mask and my cheeks squeaked from the cold.</p>
  <p><strong>Hey</strong>, I am not a mountain goat,<br>yet.</p>
  <p>I had my track jacket and a wind breaker,<br>in my bag, so it was not a problem.</p>
  <p>After few more minutes,<br>I got used to the new chill.</p>

  <p>And that's when I saw it,<br>the light were still blinking by the train tracks.</p>
  <p>It was like twenty minutes since I heard the horn,<br>so the train stopped.</p>
  <p>I saw a couple of cars shoot out of the Movie Theater road,<br>pause, and drive away after a moment.</p>
  <p>I was cut off from getting home,<br>and I couldn't stop and wait, because I would get cold.</p>
  <p>I made it to the train cars,<br>took my backpack off and put my headphones in there.</p>
  <p>I didn't want to loose them while crossing,<br>but my lightweight bag was no good for 20lb. of iron.</p>
  <p>So I had to hurl them across the tracks,<br>between the train cars.</p>

  <p>Thump,<br>the first one landed OK, but a bit short.</p>
  <p>I tried to push the second harder,<br>but it went to the side and landed in the rocks getting scuffed up.</p>
  <p>I was weakened from carrying the 20lb.,<br>for two hours straight.</p>
  <p>And that became really apparent,<br>as I heaved myself up the ladder on the side.</p>
  <p>I carefully moved between the train cars,<br>and then grabbed a bar that moved while making a squeaking noise.</p>
  <p>I would have grabbed something else if the bar was lose,<br>but I could have done away with that metal squeak.</p>
  <p>I felt pain in my arms,<br>I am usually a lot stronger</p>
  <p>The train popped up in the middle of my workout,<br>after all.</p>
  <p>Then as I made it to the corner I forgot the ladder was on the side,<br>and had a whoopse moment.</p>
  <p>I made the corner, and down like a pro,<br>with the words "Westland Loco" on my mind.</p>
  <p>It is crazy that there is no other way to cross the road,<br>the Ford. Rd. overpass above is even more dangerous then crossing the train.</p>

  <p>I got my headphones back on, took a photo,<br>and kept shuffling on - my apartment being only like 15 minutes away.</p>
  <p>I've decided not to cross the tracks again,<br>I really like that spot where the city lamps end...</p>
  <p>But, I don't want to get cut-off again,<br>even though there is a ladder, it is dangerous and pretty loco to climb trains.</p>

  <p>When I woke up in the morning,<br>there was snow on the ground.</p>
  <p>That's probably what that chill was,<br>the temperature was dropping in preparation for a bit of snow.</p>

You may not know until you try,
so don't be shy.

Think to the funny things that happened to you,
and write them down without further adu.

A book is just a collection of stories,
and you don't even need to divide them in categories.

Just make your readers wonder where are we going now,
and then, when you arrive make them say "Wow!"

Write about all the funny things,
let humor give your stories wings.

---

And always aim to narrate your book,
for those who have time to listen but not look.

The wonderful thing about travel and adventure writing,
is that you can __travel__ to find something funny or exciting.

You can go on long vacations,
and write in a funny way about your observations.

But you don't really have to travel far,
that's what's amazing about writing a memoir.

Anywhere you go,
will make ideas flow.

---

Not all stories must be funny,
and it is not required to be sunny.

A good story is one that is easy to remember,
and will bring out good vibes even in deep dark December.

Good writing is about bringing your readers along,
and making them feel like they belong.

Different cultures do different things differently,
take time to explain everything gently.

Even little things can fascinate readers from abroad,
we do lots of things that will seem interesting and odd.

---

Traveling to local museums or historic villages,
can create vivid images.

And everywhere you go there will be funny people to talk to,
those are the people with a different world view.

Awkward moments are the best,
as they often come out as funniest.

So you don't have to talk to people very much,
the funniest stories require but a gentle touch.

---

When you remember to write,
you also improve your sight.

You will pay more attention to the little, bits,
and your stories will become literary hits.

Be it a long or a short read,
all cheerful books are a pleasure, in deed.

And aside from the pleasure,
an adventure book is a time capsule and a magnificent treasure.

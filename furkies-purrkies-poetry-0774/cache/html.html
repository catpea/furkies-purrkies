  <p>I don’t know what got into me today,<br>as I arrived home from the gym...</p>
  <p>Even before,<br>I got out of my car...</p>
  <p>I already searched for,<br>“digital painting glowing eyes”.</p>

  <p>I was recently looking at fantasy art,<br>and everything is glowing in their world.</p>
  <p>So I made everything glow in one of my portraits,<br>it looked great...</p>
  <p>Until I asked,<br>what will the person in the painting think.</p>

  <p>I looked at the portrait,<br>and they now had glowing blue skin.</p>

  <p>I realized, by adding all the glowing stuff,<br>it no longer looked professional.</p>
  <p>And by going back to the original,<br>I had to remove most of the glowing parts.</p>
  <p>The glowing portrait was still recognizable,<br>but it was too scary, and more importantly too odd.</p>

  <p>Even if I made a portrait like that of myself,<br>it would still look weird, I would feel weird about it.</p>
  <p>It is just a weird thing to do,<br>It was weird.</p>

  <p>Using reference images,<br>prevented the face from becoming too distorted.</p>
  <p>It shows what a powerful guardian that is,<br>even with glowing blue skin.</p>
  <p>Using reference images protected the portrait,<br>from becoming too unrecognizable.</p>

  <p>As artists we have to be respectful,<br>of the people we paint.</p>
  <p>And unless asked to do so,<br>never cross the line where you change a person skin to glowing blue.</p>

  <p>I still learned quite a lot,<br>and tested out a theory I had.</p>
  <p>That to make something glow,<br>you don’t make it brighter.</p>
  <p>But rather begin your portrait,<br>at night, in the darkness.</p>
  <p>A face in dark shadow,<br>is critical to making something glow.</p>
  <p>And a glow is just a swipe of a strong color,<br>with a blur around it...</p>
  <p>So, a second swipe, perhaps dimmer color,<br>with a brush thrice the size but at half opacity.</p>

  <p>I think the rule of less is more,<br>is a good starting point.</p>
  <p>But glowing scenes full of dancing figures,<br>especially whimsical fantasy figures, are still a beautiful thing.</p>
  <p>It is as big of a realm of art as bobble heads,<br>that I am so fond of.</p>
  <p>I have no doubt that the same kind of enchantment that I feel for,<br>for pop surrealist bobble heads.</p>
  <p>Others will feel,<br>for magically glowing scenes at night.</p>
  <p>For many people this,<br>may become a precious gateway into art.</p>

  <p>If you do come across a request for painting,<br>a shadowy photo taken at night.</p>
  <p>Then know, it is not a bad photo,<br>but an opportunity to venture into the realm of magic.</p>
  <p>So as long as you have the permission,<br>and the customer understands that what they will get... is their fairie self, from a magical word.</p>
  <p>Blue is cold, if you make their skin glow with blue,<br>then they will seem distant, alien, and weird.</p>
  <p>Red is warm, it is also friendly towards all the tones of skin,<br>you will make them look friendly and magical.</p>
  <p>The background, is a different story,<br>it can be blue, but blue again, is not a warm color.</p>

  <p>This course is based on the pricey "<a href="https://www.audible.com/series/The-Giants-of-Philosophy-Audiobooks/B08D6T4RDC">The Giants of Philosophy</a>" series of 12 audio books,<br>I selected it because it is well written by competent writers, and read by Charlton Heston.</p>
  <p>This is a beginning, and what better start,<br>then the most powerful and famous Philosophers.</p>
  <p>I will alert you to the fact that there is in deed something missing here,<br>you are not witnessing the culture of greatness.</p>
  <p>For this I have prepared a List of Great Beings at the end of this text,<br>and I leave it up to you to locate their videos.</p>

  <p>A Philosopher is a human being who has already connected with you,<br>they thought about you, about all of us.</p>
  <p>We are for most of them,<br>the future generations.</p>
  <p>For all their greatness, mistakes, regrets, disasters, tortures, and horrors,<br>they loved us, and they believed in us.</p>
  <p>And they knew that as we grow,<br>we would set aside their mistakes and focus on their best.</p>
  <p>So that we may begin,<br>where their greatness leaves off.</p>

  <p>Before you pick up one of their books,<br>their means of communicating with you.</p>
  <p>Take to their summaries, overviews, critique,<br>take to books that talk about their books.</p>
  <p>And before you consider buying a guide book,<br>even before you consider watching a video.</p>
  <p>There is something you must do,<br>you have to befriend them, and without a question they will befriend you.</p>
  <p>To become friends with a Philosopher,<br>you have to invite them into your home sometimes across hundreds of years of time.</p>

  <p>You need to find an image depicting the philosopher you will befriend next,<br>print it out on a couple of sheets of 8x11 glue them together, and trace them on your paper.</p>
  <p>When it looks like you have captures all the details,<br>either search for a long video that talks about them get your hands on The Giants Of Philosophy Book.</p>
  <p>And then go to a coffee shop,<br>don't be alone.</p>

  <p>You will need to listen to the book multiple times as you work on your drawings,<br>make two or three, with the aim of framing the best one and having it permanently grace the walls of your house.</p>
  <p>But, and you must not ignore this step, as you learn more and more about the philosopher you have chosen,<br>write down the best they have to offer in the background of your drawing.</p>
  <p>Keep searching for videos and audio books,<br>until you fill the entire background of your portrait of them with quotes.</p>
  <p>Recognize their love and admiration for you, recognize their friendship,<br>in the vast complexity of their existence.</p>
  <p>They were always a part of your family,<br>and they will forever hope, that you too become a Great and Timeless Being with a Heart towards the future generations.</p>
  <p>Date it, and sign your portrait, it will become a family heirloom,<br>hang it up on the wall.</p>
  <p>And know,<br>that you have just made a friend for life.</p>

  <p>All the portraits combined create a kind of a friendly Memory Palace, or Cathedral if you like,<br>as the years pass, you will slowly outgrow every one of the quotes in your portraits.</p>
  <p>And you will find yourself,<br>standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>

witnessing the culture of greatness.\nFor this I have prepared a List of Great Beings at the end of this text,\nand I leave it up to you to locate their videos.\n\nLet us,\nbegin.\n\nA Philosopher is a human being who has already connected with you,\nthey thought about you, about all of us.\nWe are for most of them,\nthe future generations.\nFor all their greatness, mistakes, regrets, disasters, tortures, and horrors,\nthey loved us, and they believed in us.\nAnd they knew that as we grow,\nwe would set aside their mistakes and focus on their best.\nSo that we may begin,\nwhere their greatness leaves off.\n\nBefore you pick up one of their books,\ntheir means of communicating with you.\nTake to their summaries, overviews, critique,\ntake to books that talk about their books.\nAnd before you consider buying a guide book,\neven before you consider watching a video.\nThere is something you must do,\nyou have to befriend them, and without a question they will befriend you.\nTo become friends with a Philosopher,\nyou have to invite them into your home sometimes across hundreds of years of time.\n\nI am about to tell you how to do that,\nget ready.\n\nYou will need a Drawing Board[2], Drawing Paper[3], Drafting Dots[4], Graphite Paper[5], Art Pencils[6],\nand Blending Stumps[7].\nYou need to find an image depicting the philosopher you will befriend next,\nprint it out on a couple of sheets of 8x11 glue them together, and trace them on your paper.\nWhen it looks like you have captures all the details,\neither search for a long video that talks about them get your hands on The Giants Of Philosophy Book.\nAnd then go to a coffee shop,\ndon't be alone.\n\nYou will need to listen to the book multiple times as you work on your drawings,\nmake two or three, with the aim of framing the best one and having it permanently grace the walls of your house.\nBut, and you must not ignore this step, as you learn more and more about the philosopher you have chosen,\nwrite down the best they have to offer in the background of your drawing.\nKeep searching for videos and audio books,\nuntil you fill the entire background of your portrait of them with quotes.\nRecognize their

and Timeless Being with a Heart towards the future generations.\nDate it, and sign your portrait, it will become a family heirloom,\nhang it up on the wall.\nAnd know,\nthat you have just made a friend for life.\n\nAll the portraits combined create a kind of a friendly Memory Palace, or Cathedral if you like,\nas the years pass, you will slowly outgrow every one of the quotes in your portraits.\nAnd you will find yourself,\nstanding on the shoulders of giants.\n\nHere is the list of the Eleven Philosophers,\nthat I would like you to start with.\nPlato[8], Aristotle[9], St.

a human being who has already connected with you,\nthey thought about you, about all of us.\nWe are for most of them,\nthe future generations.\nFor all their greatness, mistakes, regrets, disasters, tortures, and horrors,\nthey loved us, and they believed in us.\nAnd they knew that as we grow,\nwe would set aside their mistakes and focus on their best.\nSo that we may begin,\nwhere their greatness leaves off.\n\nBefore you pick up one of their books,\ntheir means of communicating with you.\nTake to their summaries, overviews, critique,\ntake to books that talk about their books.\nAnd before you consider buying a guide book,\neven before you consider watching a video.\nThere is something you must do,\nyou have to befriend them, and without a question they will befriend you.\nTo become friends with a Philosopher,\nyou have to invite them into your home sometimes across hundreds of years of time.\n\nI am about to tell you how to do that,\nget ready.\n\nYou will need a Drawing Board[2], Drawing Paper[3], Drafting Dots[4], Graphite Paper[5], Art Pencils[6],\nand Blending Stumps[7].\nYou need to find an image depicting the philosopher you will befriend next,\nprint it out on a couple of sheets of 8x11 glue them together, and trace them on your paper.\nWhen it looks like you have captures all the details,\neither search for a long video that talks about them get your hands on The Giants Of Philosophy Book.\nAnd then go to a coffee shop,\ndon't be alone.\n\nYou will need to listen to the book multiple times as you work on your drawings,\nmake two or three, with the aim

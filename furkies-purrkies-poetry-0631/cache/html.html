  <p>I have made one mistake in Art when I begun,<br>I didn't know to start writing an art book, and get it done.</p>
  <p>This is an idea that I would like to share with you,<br>and I hope that you will share too.</p>

  <p>So, it maybe that your biggest work of art,<br>is a book that will help others start.</p>
  <p>Guess who is going to do all the illustrations?<br>yes, <strong>you</strong>, congratulations!</p>

  <p>One, write down the advice that comes to you while you draw,<br>even if it seems clumsy or raw.</p>
  <p>Two, illustrate pencils, screen projectors, and computer programs you use,<br>you can draw some helpful diagrams, if you choose.</p>
  <p>Three, your book also keeps photos of all your works,<br>that's one of the neat perks.</p>

  <p>But go slow as most new artists can't buy too much,<br>so start with a simple and small drawing kit, graphite paper, and such.</p>

  <p>And always remind your students to get the shadows right,<br>make sure the light in their source photos is very bright.</p>
  <p>It is always good to start with hard light; and deep shadows and darks,<br>as those become the works that will get the most remarks.</p>
  <p>Good light and some hard shadows will make a portrait come alive,<br>and your book project will thrive.</p>

  <p>Always have copies of your book to give away for free,<br>and remind the new artists not to go on a shopping spree.</p>
  <p>Artist's pencils should be inexpensive and easy to get,<br>then all they need is some paper and blending stumps, and they are set.</p>
  <p>Remind your students not to push the pencils into paper too much,<br>tell them not to scar their paper, and to keep a light touch.</p>

  <p>To be respectful of the person you are drawing you can't be too-careful,<br>use a projector of graphite copy paper to make your subject cheerful.</p>
  <p>You should take the photo yourself, print it out and trace it,<br>this can only server to your benefit.</p>
  <p>If you like computers load it up into a photo editing app,<br>lower color count and trace edges to create a tracing map.</p>
  <p>If you don't mind electronics get a pico or mini projector,<br>or you can get a inexpensive one that uses a light bulb and a reflector.</p>

  <p>Once you trace all the proportions right,<br>that's when you really start.</p>
  <p>And I always begun with the eyes,<br>I made them wise and full of stars and skies.</p>
  <p>Always create multiple sketches, portraits, and works,<br>some with deep darks overwhelmed with shadows, others full of fireworks.</p>
  <p>It is not possible to just create one work of art,<br>it will either be too much light or too dark.</p>
  <p>It takes many tries to frame a person's character, heart, soul,<br>and that should always be the goal.</p>

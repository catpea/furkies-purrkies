frighten us,<br>are just victims of fake education.</p>\n  <p>Universal income, where we borrow from the improved future of humanity,<br>and grant each human being a serious amount of money is a critical component of real education.</p>\n  <p>In short, a scared, or stressed out, or pressured by poverty person,<br>will not be able to fully develop an urge for respected Peer Reviewed Knowledge, and resulting internal wisdom.</p>\n  <p>It is that wisdom born of stable and clean and dependable knowledge,<br>that will assure control over climate change, collapse of ecosystems, loss of species,

into.</p>\n  <p>No political force can ever become greater,<br>than a well meaning scientist with all the evidence right behind her.</p>\n  <p>The improved schools will pose an enormous challenge to liars,<br>they will be required to retake tests.</p>\n  <p>The gravity of climate change and repair,<br>is such that the uneducated will be severely limited in their political powers - until they show

MINDFUL,<br>that each art show must be followed by the next, and you have to keep that promise.</p>\n  <p>You Art Portfolio, will absolutely become a family heirloom,<br>certainly it will be a website, but perhaps it will be a book sold in stores, or a journal you are attached to as well.</p>\n  <p>In your lifetime, it MUST be a reminder to continue exhibiting new shows and ideas,<br>and beyond it will be a connection to who you were.</p>\n  <p>I write this in the 2020's by the 50's we may see the first cheap version of a global universal income program,<br>aimed at prevention of mass immigration, animal slaughter, destroying the remainder of the amazon forest.</p>\n  <p>And by the 90's we may actually have a prevention program,<br>that is worthy of Humanity, that will be enough for us to take to real education.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you make your art hint on School Improvements, And Real Education,<br>Authenticity And Honesty especially in Politics...</p>\n  <p>And about the thing that actually solves Climate Change and Loss Of Species,<br>the Universal Income Card that helps people retain their Dignity and Health,</p>\n  <p>and creates room for their natural yearning<br>of Knowledge and Wisdom...</p>\n  <p>You will be remembered with smiles, and admiration,<br>with appreciation.</p>\n  <p>And a hundred years from now,<br>people will still look back at you, and wish they could talk to you, and be your friend, and be around you.</p>\n  <p>That is what all art is for, no matter what type,<br>art is for creating a bookmark in the History of Human Kind.</p>\n  <p>A bookmark that curious people can turn to,<br>and entertain their curiosities whilst conjuring up your spirit sometimes across centuries.</p>\n  <p>Humanity will be around for a long time,<br>and people will be fascinated with 2000's there will be many-a-meme from the stuff we uploaded.</p>\n  <p>I am certain that Pop Surrealism, propaganda posters included,<br>will become the biggest thing since the Renascence.</p>\n</div>",

completely true, even your elder-self agrees:<br>\"If it is not in your portfolio it didn't happen.\".</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So take all the pictures,<br>put them in neatly organized directories and back them up into multiple cloud services.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Make sure that once your hard drive dies, and it happens every few years,<br>nothing will be lost, other than a few minutes of your time as you replace it.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\"

setup,<br>and that included painting all the art.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I used a projector,<br>canvas paper, couple of canvas, I did not use frames.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I just hung everything up at a coffeehouse,<br>and took it down a week or two later.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Though I didn't intend to sell anything,<br>I had one sale.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It frightened me,<br>because people that pay for my art seem suspicious.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I had labels describing the meaning of my art,<br>I wanted to share the meaning.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Previously, I invented (or probably independently invented)<br>a new kind of Art Form, I called it Content Art.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It means that there is a lot of content in the piece,<br>diagrams, mind maps, poems, and little codes that you can scan to go to websites.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Life got busy and I never had a Content Art show,<br>it evolved in a Symbolic Language that I would like to use in an educational setting.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Basically students have to create concept maps that help them through a game,<br>that consists of rooms, libraries, worlds - it is a school that teacher for real.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Every concept map is a mini game,<br>that unlocks doors and futures.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">In that way, I guess,<br>I am yet to have that art show.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">What I have here for you,<br>is also a challenge.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I am challenging you top create a series of Minimalist Content Art pieces,<br>for your first extremely outrageous, on topic, and if you want to to be Guerrilla art show.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Guerrilla Art shows,<br>is where you exhibit your art by just putting it up in places where it is seen.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes it is taken down,<br>sometimes you put it up again.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes, people take your art home,<br>and it makes them cry.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes they become free,<br>sometimes they just laugh.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Nothing bad ever happens,<br>unless you are as skittish as me about interacting with people that pay you for the damn things.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Take the money, tell them your house is on fire,<br>and run away.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The rules of the challenge are simple,<br>create five to then posters that are inspired by, or directly quote the text below.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is OK not to come up with your own text,<br>I have put the text below in the public domain.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is all good natured sarcasm,<br>but I don't like any of it.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I don't like talking about negative things,<br>even though, obviously this is all reverse psychology.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The challenge is about creating fake <span>Propaganda Posters<sup>[2]</sup></span>,<br>that when seen by a person on the street.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Or seen hanging in some abandoned office,<br>or nailed to a tree somewhere, or even blown down the street in the wind...</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Will make the reader, pause,<br>and really take a deep look at what they are saying.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The poster,<br>is supposed to make them think.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If you are looking beyond Guerrilla Art,<br>then have a professional print them out, and then put a layer of glass over it, skip the expensive frames.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And if you want to go 3D,<br>buy some used briefcases, luggage, and create sculptures.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The theme of the show would be,<br>evil men who left their briefcases behind, or something similar.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Be warned, Guerrilla Art and Briefcases Do not mix,<br>you may go to jail or pay an enormous fine.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So briefcases are gallery only,<br>and I would set the price at 500 to a 1,000 bucks or your equivalent - it is just cool art.</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes people will buy your art to befriend you,<br>that is not how friendships work, so be very careful and as suspicious as I am.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\"

  "text": "An Art Show is a few days,\nof where you make your art speak.\nYou can make it yell,\nyou can make it whisper.\nYou can make it relevant,\nor it can be totally retro.\nPlease, understand,\nbeing shy is beautiful.\nAnd you will be beautiful,\nfor being shy.\nThere is no such a thing,\nas a bad art show.\n\nI will stress,\nthat everything needs to go into your portfolio.\nI hate to say it, while this is not completely true, even your elder-self agrees:\n\"If it is not in your portfolio it didn't happen.\".\nSo take all the pictures,\nput them in neatly organized directories and back them up into multiple cloud services.\nMake sure that once your hard drive dies, and it happens every few years,\nnothing will be lost, other than a few minutes of your time as you replace it.\n\nSunaura Taylor's website[1],\nis a nice example of what your website should contain.\nBut do keep the JavaScript to minimum,\nand setup https, at the time of writing GitHub Pages seem a OK.\n\nMy first art-show took 12 hours to setup,\nand that included painting all the art.\nI used a projector,\ncanvas paper, couple of canvas, I did not use frames.\nI just hung everything up at a coffeehouse,\nand took it down a week or two later.\nThough I didn't intend to sell anything,\nI had one sale.\nIt frightened me,\nbecause people that pay for my art seem suspicious.\n\nI had labels describing the meaning of my art,\nI wanted to share the meaning.\nPreviously, I invented (or probably independently invented)\na new kind of Art Form, I called it Content Art.\nIt means that there is a lot of content in the piece,\ndiagrams, mind maps, poems, and little codes that you can scan to go to websites.\nLife got busy and I never had a Content Art show,\nit evolved in a Symbolic Language that I would like to use in an educational setting.\nBasically students have to create concept maps that help them through a game,\nthat consists of rooms, libraries, worlds - it is a school that teacher for real.\nEvery concept map is a mini game,\nthat unlocks doors and futures.\nIn that way, I guess,\nI am yet to have that art show.\n\nWhat I have here for you,\nis also a challenge.\nI am challenging you top create a series of Minimalist Content Art pieces,\nfor your first extremely outrageous, on topic, and if you want to to be Guerrilla art show.\nGuerrilla Art shows,\nis where you exhibit your art by just putting it up in places where it is seen.\nSometimes it is taken down,\nsometimes you put it up again.\nSometimes, people take your art home,\nand it makes them cry.\nSometimes they become free,\nsometimes they just laugh.\nNothing bad ever happens,\nunless you are as skittish as me about interacting with people that pay you for the damn things.\nTake the money, tell them your house is on fire,\nand run away.\n\nThe rules of the challenge are simple,\ncreate five to then posters that are inspired by, or directly quote the text below.\nIt is OK not to come up with your own text,\nI have put the text below in the public domain.\nIt is all good natured sarcasm,\nbut I don't like any of it.\nI don't like talking about negative things,\neven though, obviously this is all reverse psychology.\n\nThe challenge is about creating fake Propaganda Posters[2],\nthat when seen by a person on the street.\nOr seen hanging in some abandoned office,\nor nailed to a tree somewhere, or even blown down the street in the wind...\nWill make the reader, pause,\nand really take a deep look at what they are saying.\nThe poster,\nis supposed to make them think.\n\nIf you are looking beyond Guerrilla Art,\nthen have a professional print them out, and then put a layer of glass over it, skip the expensive frames.\nAnd if you want to go 3D,\nbuy some used briefcases, luggage, and create sculptures.\nThe theme of the show would be,\nevil men who left their briefcases behind, or something similar.\nBe warned, Guerrilla Art and Briefcases Do not mix,\nyou may go to jail or pay an enormous fine.\nSo briefcases are gallery only,\nand I would set the price at 500 to a 1,000 bucks or your equivalent - it is just cool art.\nSometimes people will buy your art to befriend you,\nthat is not how friendships work, so be very careful and as suspicious as I am.\n\nSo let me formally disclaim the ownership of these texts,\nso that you have no worries about anything.\n\"Please Note That The Following Text, is released into Public Domain,\nFor those of you looking for a specific license see WTFPL[3]\"\n\nAllow me one more note for all the conspiracy lovers,\nthere is no conspiracy to hurt the world.\nThere maybe some fools pretending to take credit,\nbut they are not the reason.\nThe problem with the world today is lack of real and effective education,\nfrom that point on the consequences only compound and complexity.\nAll the people that frighten us,\nare just victims of fake education.\nUniversal income, where we borrow from the improved future of humanity,\nand grant each human being a serious amount of money is a critical component of real education.\nIn short, a scared, or stressed out, or pressured by poverty person,\nwill not be able to fully develop an urge for respected Peer Reviewed Knowledge, and resulting internal wisdom.\nIt is that wisdom born of stable and clean and dependable knowledge,\nthat will assure control over climate change, collapse of ecosystems, loss of species, mass incarceration, nuclear threats, and so on.\nWe are nothing like some civilization destined to be forgotten,\nScience and Wisdom will grow more powerful the more trouble we get into.\nNo political force can ever become greater,\nthan a well meaning scientist with all the evidence right behind her.\nThe improved schools will pose an enormous challenge to liars,\nthey will be required to retake tests.\nThe gravity of climate change and repair,\nis such that the uneducated will be severely limited in their political powers - until they show Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and a Fine Grasp On Reality.\nDon't worry, it is just that today Humanity is just a baby,\nbut this century it is destined to become as wise as a mighty and unstoppable teenager - we'll be OK.\n\nTo imagine the future, imagine it is 1920 right now,\nand compare the 20's to the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and so on.\nNow bring the magnitude of these changes out of 1920 into 2020,\nand now by subtle analogy look into the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and so on.\nIt will all work out OK,\nbut the next century will not begin with ineffective education, as they will know where that shit will lead to now.\n\nWithout further adu,\nhere are the taglines for the posters:\n\nOn School And Education\nMake Them Fear Powerful Books,\nAnd Teach Them Textbooks Only.\nMake Them Work Eight Hours Per Day In High School.\nIf They Complain About Work,\nBring Them To Heel To Eviscerate That Quirk.\nBe Careful, Because Too Much Education,\nCould End Wage Slavery In Our Nation.\nTo Protect Our Beautiful Nation,\nSchools Must Ridicule And Speak Out Against Self Education,\nTo Easily Put Food On Your Table,\nTrick Them All That They Are Unable.\nMake Sure They Don't Figure Out,\nThat We Sold Them All Out.\nShow Sass And Kiss Our Ass,\nBecause The Grades We Give You,\nCan Make Or Break Your Job Interview.\nForce Students Into Temporary Memorization,\nTo Make Them Better Servants Of This Nation.\nA Productive Teacher Dumbs Down Tests And Education,\nAnd Forces The Students Into Temporary Rote Memorization.\nFake Education Protects Our Nation.\nA Well Educated Worker, Could Start A Revolution.\nA Student That Retains Knowledge,\nMust Be Forced Into Impossible Debt In College.\nDon't Be A Tool,\nEducated Voters Won't Vote For A Fool.\nDefund Education,\nTo Prevent Student Agitation.\nYour Position Is Worth A Ton,\nHire A Crook To Elect Your Son.\nShitty Textbooks,\nWill Help Us Reelect Crooks.\nKeep It At Student Debt Forgiveness,\nDo Not Let Them Figure Out All Deserve A Refund.\n\nMoney Ideas\nEven Though Money Is For The Banks,\nMake The Fools Think That's How They Rise In Ranks.\nLife Is Money.\nEarn A Living.\nSpend All Your Cash,\nOn Useless Trash.\nShorting[4] Student Debt,\nIs A Sure Fuc**g Bet.\nTeach Them Universal Income Is Bad,\nOtherwise They Will Rise Up And Get Mad.\nMake Sure They Are All Sick, Poor, And Disagreeing,\nOtherwise It Is A Hundred Bucks For Every Human Being.\nKeep Them Thinking It Is Just Income Inequality,\nAnd Not Universal Income Of The Highest Quality.\nOn Planet Earth,\nPaycheck Is Your Worth.\nWe Should All Agree,\nThat Overwork Will Set You Free.\nKeep 'Em Poor,\nForce Them To Endure.\n\nReligion\nForce Them To Worship Men That Invented The Wheel Barrow,\nAnd Their Thinking Will Be Simple, Shallow, And Narrow.\nTeach Them That They Are Less,\nAnd That You Are More,\nAnd Watch Their Empty Eyes Adore.\nTell Them They Are All Born In Sin,\nAnd That They Are Lost And Cannot Win.\nMake Sure Not To Mention What We Got Away With,\nConvince Them That It Is Just A Myth.\n\nMilitary\nRelax By Drinking Plenty Of Alcohol In Bars,\nSo That Our Generals Can Get More Kindergarten Stars.\nTo Quench Our Nation's Thirst,\nMilitary Industrial Complex Must Come First.\nWe Don't Want You To Be Skilled.\nJust Follow Our Directions And Be Strong Willed.\nEducated Teenagers Make Bad Soldiers As They Can Actually Think,\nTherefore, We Must Crush Them Into Smoking S**t And An Alcoholic Drink.\nFind All The Ones That Are Strong And Tall,\nAnd Lie To Them At The Mall.\n\nMedicine\nHospitals Demand That You Become Overweight,\nAnd Line Up At The Gate.\nYou Must Smile More Often,\nBecause Depression Is A Form Of Oppression.\nDon't Be So Brittle\nPay For The Hospital,\nWith Your Family Capital.\n\nClimate\nDon't Be A Deadbeat,\nEat Plenty Of Meat.\nStand Proud For Stock Exchange.\nAnd Tell Them Not To Change For Climate Change,\nMake Sure They Never Figure Out,\nThat Destroying Nature Is Something We Are Too Old To Worry About.\n\nCreativity\nYou Must Give Up Your Creativity,\nTo Increase Your Productivity.\nLaugh At Their Rhymes,\nTo Trick Them Into Working For Dimes.\nThinking With Your Heart,\nWon't Make You Smart.\nIf You Want To Make A Dope,\nTeach Them To Merely Hope.\nShhh, Don't Tell Them About Startups[5],\nMake Them Think They Are Only For Grownups.\n\nAnd Finally,\nRevolutionary Posters Are Not Art,\nWe Must Stop Them From Becoming Smart.\n\nI am very sorry for the serious tone of some of these taglines,\nbut I want you to see that Art is a superpower.\nI want you to witness, your posters, altering people,\ninspiring them, helping them rise, snapping them out of their slumber.\n\nIn conclusion, to this imperfect list,\nart shows are a very precious thing.\nAnd they are meant to be protected,\nnever ever, ever, if you can help it, should you ever look back and say -

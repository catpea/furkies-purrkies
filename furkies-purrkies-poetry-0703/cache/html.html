  <p>An Art Show is a few days,<br>of where you make your art speak.</p>
  <p>You can make it yell,<br>you can make it whisper.</p>
  <p>You can make it relevant,<br>or it can be totally retro.</p>
  <p>Please, understand,<br>being shy is beautiful.</p>
  <p>And you will be beautiful,<br>for being shy.</p>
  <p>There is no such a thing,<br>as a bad art show.</p>

  <p>I will stress,<br>that everything needs to go into your portfolio.</p>
  <p>I hate to say it, while this is not completely true, even your elder-self agrees:<br>"If it is not in your portfolio it didn't happen.".</p>
  <p>So take all the pictures,<br>put them in neatly organized directories and back them up into multiple cloud services.</p>
  <p>Make sure that once your hard drive dies, and it happens every few years,<br>nothing will be lost, other than a few minutes of your time as you replace it.</p>

  <p>My first art-show took 12 hours to setup,<br>and that included painting all the art.</p>
  <p>I used a projector,<br>canvas paper, couple of canvas, I did not use frames.</p>
  <p>I just hung everything up at a coffeehouse,<br>and took it down a week or two later.</p>
  <p>Though I didn't intend to sell anything,<br>I had one sale.</p>
  <p>It frightened me,<br>because people that pay for my art seem suspicious.</p>

  <p>I had labels describing the meaning of my art,<br>I wanted to share the meaning.</p>
  <p>Previously, I invented (or probably independently invented)<br>a new kind of Art Form, I called it Content Art.</p>
  <p>It means that there is a lot of content in the piece,<br>diagrams, mind maps, poems, and little codes that you can scan to go to websites.</p>
  <p>Life got busy and I never had a Content Art show,<br>it evolved in a Symbolic Language that I would like to use in an educational setting.</p>
  <p>Basically students have to create concept maps that help them through a game,<br>that consists of rooms, libraries, worlds - it is a school that teacher for real.</p>
  <p>Every concept map is a mini game,<br>that unlocks doors and futures.</p>
  <p>In that way, I guess,<br>I am yet to have that art show.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>What I have here for you,<br>is also a challenge.</p>
  <p>I am challenging you top create a series of Minimalist Content Art pieces,<br>for your first extremely outrageous, on topic, and if you want to to be Guerrilla art show.</p>
  <p>Guerrilla Art shows,<br>is where you exhibit your art by just putting it up in places where it is seen.</p>
  <p>Sometimes it is taken down,<br>sometimes you put it up again.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, people take your art home,<br>and it makes them cry.</p>
  <p>Sometimes they become free,<br>sometimes they just laugh.</p>
  <p>Nothing bad ever happens,<br>unless you are as skittish as me about interacting with people that pay you for the damn things.</p>
  <p>Take the money, tell them your house is on fire,<br>and run away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The rules of the challenge are simple,<br>create five to then posters that are inspired by, or directly quote the text below.</p>
  <p>It is OK not to come up with your own text,<br>I have put the text below in the public domain.</p>
  <p>It is all good natured sarcasm,<br>but I don't like any of it.</p>
  <p>I don't like talking about negative things,<br>even though, obviously this is all reverse psychology.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The challenge is about creating fake <a href="https://www.qwant.com/?client=opensearch&q=Propaganda+Posters&t=images">Propaganda Posters</a>,<br>that when seen by a person on the street.</p>
  <p>Or seen hanging in some abandoned office,<br>or nailed to a tree somewhere, or even blown down the street in the wind...</p>
  <p>Will make the reader, pause,<br>and really take a deep look at what they are saying.</p>
  <p>The poster,<br>is supposed to make them think.</p>

  <p>If you are looking beyond Guerrilla Art,<br>then have a professional print them out, and then put a layer of glass over it, skip the expensive frames.</p>
  <p>And if you want to go 3D,<br>buy some used briefcases, luggage, and create sculptures.</p>
  <p>The theme of the show would be,<br>evil men who left their briefcases behind, or something similar.</p>
  <p>Be warned, Guerrilla Art and Briefcases Do not mix,<br>you may go to jail or pay an enormous fine.</p>
  <p>So briefcases are gallery only,<br>and I would set the price at 500 to a 1,000 bucks or your equivalent - it is just cool art.</p>
  <p>Sometimes people will buy your art to befriend you,<br>that is not how friendships work, so be very careful and as suspicious as I am.</p>

  <p>Allow me one more note for all the conspiracy lovers,<br>there is no conspiracy to hurt the world.</p>
  <p>There maybe some fools pretending to take credit,<br>but they are not the reason.</p>
  <p>The problem with the world today is lack of real and effective education,<br>from that point on the consequences only compound and complexity.</p>
  <p>All the people that frighten us,<br>are just victims of fake education.</p>
  <p>Universal income, where we borrow from the improved future of humanity,<br>and grant each human being a serious amount of money is a critical component of real education.</p>
  <p>In short, a scared, or stressed out, or pressured by poverty person,<br>will not be able to fully develop an urge for respected Peer Reviewed Knowledge, and resulting internal wisdom.</p>
  <p>It is that wisdom born of stable and clean and dependable knowledge,<br>that will assure control over climate change, collapse of ecosystems, loss of species, mass incarceration, nuclear threats, and so on.</p>
  <p>We are nothing like some civilization destined to be forgotten,<br>Science and Wisdom will grow more powerful the more trouble we get into.</p>
  <p>No political force can ever become greater,<br>than a well meaning scientist with all the evidence right behind her.</p>
  <p>The improved schools will pose an enormous challenge to liars,<br>they will be required to retake tests.</p>
  <p>The gravity of climate change and repair,<br>is such that the uneducated will be severely limited in their political powers - until they show Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and a Fine Grasp On Reality.</p>
  <p>Don't worry, it is just that today Humanity is just a baby,<br>but this century it is destined to become as wise as a mighty and unstoppable teenager - we'll be OK.</p>

  <p>To imagine the future, imagine it is 1920 right now,<br>and compare the 20's to the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and so on.</p>
  <p>Now bring the magnitude of these changes out of 1920 into 2020,<br>and now by subtle analogy look into the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, and so on.</p>
  <p>It will all work out OK,<br>but the next century will not begin with ineffective education, as they will know where that shit will lead to now.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, to this imperfect list,<br>art shows are a very precious thing.</p>
  <p>And they are meant to be protected,<br>never ever, ever, if you can help it, should you ever look back and say - last time I had an art show was 30 years ago.</p>
  <p>You have to be MINDFUL,<br>that each art show must be followed by the next, and you have to keep that promise.</p>
  <p>You Art Portfolio, will absolutely become a family heirloom,<br>certainly it will be a website, but perhaps it will be a book sold in stores, or a journal you are attached to as well.</p>
  <p>In your lifetime, it MUST be a reminder to continue exhibiting new shows and ideas,<br>and beyond it will be a connection to who you were.</p>
  <p>I write this in the 2020's by the 50's we may see the first cheap version of a global universal income program,<br>aimed at prevention of mass immigration, animal slaughter, destroying the remainder of the amazon forest.</p>
  <p>And by the 90's we may actually have a prevention program,<br>that is worthy of Humanity, that will be enough for us to take to real education.</p>

  <p>If you make your art hint on School Improvements, And Real Education,<br>Authenticity And Honesty especially in Politics...</p>
  <p>And about the thing that actually solves Climate Change and Loss Of Species,<br>the Universal Income Card that helps people retain their Dignity and Health,</p>
  <p>and creates room for their natural yearning<br>of Knowledge and Wisdom...</p>
  <p>You will be remembered with smiles, and admiration,<br>with appreciation.</p>
  <p>And a hundred years from now,<br>people will still look back at you, and wish they could talk to you, and be your friend, and be around you.</p>
  <p>That is what all art is for, no matter what type,<br>art is for creating a bookmark in the History of Human Kind.</p>
  <p>A bookmark that curious people can turn to,<br>and entertain their curiosities whilst conjuring up your spirit sometimes across centuries.</p>
  <p>Humanity will be around for a long time,<br>and people will be fascinated with 2000's there will be many-a-meme from the stuff we uploaded.</p>
  <p>I am certain that Pop Surrealism, propaganda posters included,<br>will become the biggest thing since the Renascence.</p>

  "text": "And to protect education, to make it permanently real,\nwe must remove it from the control of any and all politicians.\nIt may seem like they may not directly influence what is taught,\nat least in more developed nations - but that is false.\nRaising tuition, is the same, or worse,\nas teaching a fantasy, or opinion, over fact.\nUnderpaying teachers and lowering standards,\nis the same as hiring actors that, eventually, merely pretend to teach.\nThe politicians don't have to ask to burn, or ban, or rewrite the books,\nthey just need to keep the prices high, and effort low, and the rest will take care of it self.\n\nFor all the outstanding teachers in the world,\nand their arguments against computerized education.\nThere are millions of teachers,\nthat cause overwhelming harm, that result s in people moving away from books.\nThis is not a try harder scenario,\nthere are only two kinds of education systems with nothing in between.\nIt is either ineffective and fake,\nor real and profound.\n\nFor a dictator to triumph,\nthey must collapse education.\nEducation does not collapse on its own,\nit is our greatest invention - it is our natural direction.\nA well educated nation,\nhas high standards for political seats.\nA high demand for honesty and long term vision of the future,\nand most importantly peer reviewed accomplishments, that eventually pave the way into politics.\n\nIn a nation with collapsed education,\nyou will find cult and nationalism.\nAnd again, that is not by chance,\nit is a pre-requisite for political criminals to flourish.\nAny kind of educational interference,\nwill always lead to war, crime, and suffering.\nThe collapse of education is rarely about the burning of books,\nand most often, imperceptible.\n\nIt is easy for well funded organizations,\nto attack education.\nThey will prevent canceling of debt,\nbe it by nation-wide forgiveness or personal bankruptcy.\nOr they will simply do nothing as tuition fees rise,\nor, cause interference in hopes of lowering tuition.\nThey will do nothing to increase teacher pay,\nnothing to encourage better teachers.\nThey will stand by as schools become ineffective,\nand books get banned, and inner-city schools beg for funding.\nBefore long student loan debt becomes crushing,\nand more and more people will see education as optional or unnecessary.\n\nBy that time however it won't be real education,\nit will be broken, ineffective, and pretty much, a theater.\nIt will be a picture of education,\nbut beneath anything but.\n\nA great part of wide spread cults of our world,\nare simple answers to common questions.\nFrom the reward of heaven after a life of servitude,\nto broken answers like, \"...thus, god is above logic and reason\".\nThese fantasies spread,\nby filling-in, all the simple answers.\nCollective fantasies, ease anxiety or suffering,\nand bring a measure of pleasure, in what usually end up being dark ages and poverty.\n\nSuch is the case with fake or ineffective schools,\nfor a price, they will sell the knowledge of some subject.\nThey will back it up with a certificate,\nand the fact that the graduate can't pass the test again, be damned.\nEven if a graduate can retake all the tests,\nit does not mean that they have the necessary comprehension of their subjects.\nHaving memorized a hundred formulas,\nwill not make a mathematician.\n\nThe group of people behind the imperceptible collapse of a nations education system,\nwill then have no trouble being elected into high positions.\nWhich will grant them even more power to corrupt,\nand eventually lead to a crime family in charge of a nation.\nThis in turn leads to corruption, and complete bankruptcy,\nwhich is them easily swept under the rug by means of war, under the cover of nationalism or some other low effort fantsy.\nBy that time, propaganda and opinion will have long become louder,\nthan the voice of reason and hope of world peace.\n\nFor an advanced nation, the defense against such an attack,\nis found in protection of a real and profound educational system, and a culture and wisdom and knowledge.\nHere educated voters must greatly outnumber,\nthe uneducated, the easily intimidated, easily impressed, or easily mislead, the easily satisfied, and the easily sold out.\n\nPeople wishing to be in politics,\njust wanting to make their way into it, to have followers, to have something to show.\nHave long prevented the rise of any advanced nation,\nwherever we look we see nations ready for war, nations with warped criminal justice.\nWe see mass incarceration,\nin a nation whose amendment on slavery, still clearly states that a criminal is a slave.\n\nNot only must we protect real education,\nbut we are yet to bring nations into such an advanced state.\n\nWe must begin the creation of a real school that follows the student,\nas soon as they begin caring about the world, as soon as they have questions.\nAnd we must make sure that the answers are the best that we have,\nthat a child is not made into a fool.\n\nToday school is seen as a place that a child goes to,\nand a lot of children see it as stressful, fake, and punishing.\nUnder the threat of poverty students are forced to give up on real education[1],\nand begin a fantasy education that revolves around grades and graduations and tests they would fail if they had to retake again later on[2].\n\nWe can't trust the politics of a nation,\nbut we can trust peer reviewed automated school materials that function more like a game.\nRather than demanding obedience by marking a student down,\nwith a grade that eventually convinces them and their future employers they are unintelligent.\nWe simply create a range of educational systems where students where students have to progress as if in a game,\nwhere a door will be closed to them until they beat the level.\nAnd the levels or the curriculum,\nmust be always of their own choosing.\nMiddle School, High School, College turned into a friendly and rewarding computer game,\nwhen beat, a person can hold up the paths they traveled as great achievement, as something to be truly proud of.\n\nMake no mistake, I am asking you to remove education,\nfrom the hands of politicians, well meaning or not.\nI am asking you to put beautiful education in the hands of children,\nso that they may grow independent of the artificial or political culture of whatever the place they happened to be born into.\nBy the time they grow to make use of real education,\nmost of the world politicians will have long retired.\nIt costs the world next to nothing to grant the younger generations,\na wiser, better, safer, and more peaceful world.\n \nReferences\n[1]:

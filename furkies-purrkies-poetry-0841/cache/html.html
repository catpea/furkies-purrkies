  <p>And to protect education, to make it permanently real,<br>we must remove it from the control of any and all politicians.</p>
  <p>It may seem like they may not directly influence what is taught,<br>at least in more developed nations - but that is false.</p>
  <p>Raising tuition, is the same, or worse,<br>as teaching a fantasy, or opinion, over fact.</p>
  <p>Underpaying teachers and lowering standards,<br>is the same as hiring actors that, eventually, merely pretend to teach.</p>
  <p>The politicians don't have to ask to burn, or ban, or rewrite the books,<br>they just need to keep the prices high, and effort low, and the rest will take care of it self.</p>

  <p>For all the outstanding teachers in the world,<br>and their arguments against computerized education.</p>
  <p>There are millions of teachers,<br>that cause overwhelming harm, that result s in people moving away from books.</p>
  <p>This is not a try harder scenario,<br>there are only two kinds of education systems with nothing in between.</p>
  <p>It is either ineffective and fake,<br>or real and profound.</p>

  <p>For a dictator to triumph,<br>they must collapse education.</p>
  <p>Education does not collapse on its own,<br>it is our greatest invention - it is our natural direction.</p>
  <p>A well educated nation,<br>has high standards for political seats.</p>
  <p>A high demand for honesty and long term vision of the future,<br>and most importantly peer reviewed accomplishments, that eventually pave the way into politics.</p>

  <p>In a nation with collapsed education,<br>you will find cult and nationalism.</p>
  <p>And again, that is not by chance,<br>it is a pre-requisite for political criminals to flourish.</p>
  <p>Any kind of educational interference,<br>will always lead to war, crime, and suffering.</p>
  <p>The collapse of education is rarely about the burning of books,<br>and most often, imperceptible.</p>

  <p>It is easy for well funded organizations,<br>to attack education.</p>
  <p>They will prevent canceling of debt,<br>be it by nation-wide forgiveness or personal bankruptcy.</p>
  <p>Or they will simply do nothing as tuition fees rise,<br>or, cause interference in hopes of lowering tuition.</p>
  <p>They will do nothing to increase teacher pay,<br>nothing to encourage better teachers.</p>
  <p>They will stand by as schools become ineffective,<br>and books get banned, and inner-city schools beg for funding.</p>
  <p>Before long student loan debt becomes crushing,<br>and more and more people will see education as optional or unnecessary.</p>

  <p>A great part of wide spread cults of our world,<br>are simple answers to common questions.</p>

  <p>These fantasies spread,<br>by filling-in, all the simple answers.</p>

  <p>Even if a graduate can retake all the tests,<br>it does not mean that they have the necessary comprehension of their subjects.</p>

  <p>The group of people behind the imperceptible collapse of a nations education system,<br>will then have no trouble being elected into high positions.</p>

  <p>This in turn leads to corruption, and complete bankruptcy,<br>which is them easily swept under the rug by means of war, under the cover of nationalism or some other low effort fantsy.</p>
  <p>By that time, propaganda and opinion will have long become louder,<br>than the voice of reason and hope of world peace.</p>

  <p>For an advanced nation, the defense against such an attack,<br>is found in protection of a real and profound educational system, and a culture and wisdom and knowledge.</p>
  <p>Here educated voters must greatly outnumber,<br>the uneducated, the easily intimidated, easily impressed, or easily mislead, the easily satisfied, and the easily sold out.</p>

  <p>Rather than demanding obedience by marking a student down,<br>with a grade that eventually convinces them and their future employers they are unintelligent.</p>
  <p>We simply create a range of educational systems where students where students have to progress as if in a game,<br>where a door will be closed to them until they beat the level.</p>
  <p>And the levels or the curriculum,<br>must be always of their own choosing.</p>

  <p>Make no mistake, I am asking you to remove education,<br>from the hands of politicians, well meaning or not.</p>
  <p>I am asking you to put beautiful education in the hands of children,<br>so that they may grow independent of the artificial or political culture of whatever the place they happened to be born into.</p>
  <p>By the time they grow to make use of real education,<br>most of the world politicians will have long retired.</p>
  <p>It costs the world next to nothing to grant the younger generations,<br>a wiser, better, safer, and more peaceful world.</p>

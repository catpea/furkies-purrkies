  <p>It is easy, but you have to take it easy,<br>you have to be good to yourself and learn for a long time.</p>
  <p>For me, I think it was an old DOS computer,<br>that had a CAD program installed on on it.</p>
  <p>And while I had no idea what CAD was,<br>as I was still busy with learning English.</p>
  <p>I understood what was going on,<br>but for one reason only - because of how elegant it was.</p>
  <p>The screen was divided in four parts,<br>top view, left view, front view and a 3D view.</p>
  <p>I could see that editing a thing from front, left, right and top,<br>would allow me to create any shape I wanted.</p>
  <p>This made a great impression on me,<br>as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhGtYfpmxyY">I could create things in three dimensions without rotoscoping</a>.</p>
  <p>For the sake of completion, the program I was looking at was probably a cheap clone of<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgq10etls5k">DOS 3D Studio</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCNs3bAE5Nw">some ancient version of AutoCAD</a>.</p>
  <p>Next time 3D graphics came up,<br>was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJo_P9mHFd8">when I discovered POV-Ray</a>.</p>
  <p>There is a great power in trading the user interface,<br>for a programming language, instead of clicking you are coding.</p>
  <p>I didn’t know it at the time,<br>but POV-Ray was my introduction to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62SbexSgQIw&list=PLPrhS0jDJbmxPXKj60YPRs04V_nqCPyZ4">Generative Art</a>.</p>
  <p>Over time,<br>I daydream about it.</p>
  <p>A handful of daydreams,<br>across many years.</p>
  <p>Few years ago <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrUoQE8wf_A&list=PLxSzI2u7zKsQVxA4dKbZcO-hIuiYVQ5kG">I played around with Zbrush</a>,<br>to see if maybe I could learn something more.</p>
  <p>And finally, couple of years ago,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tinkercad+tutorial">I got tired of heavy wallets during my workouts and sat down to TinkerCAD, to make a new one</a>.</p>
  <p>My wallet came out as block of plastic, and it wasn’t very nice,<br>but TinkerCAD helped me learn about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEMNv4mze3Q">use of Substraction in 3D modeling</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouvf-4wciak">Which led me to few other 3D concepts</a>,<br>and I felt that I was really making progress.</p>
  <p>Yesterday morning I got FreeCAD running on my Walmart laptop,<br>and this morning, I studied “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz9W3-wAITI">FreeCAD Boolean Operations in Part Design</a>” video.</p>
  <p>And figured it all out, including a crazy little thing where if you try to do a drag select from upper left to lower right you select points<br>if you drag lower right to upper left you select lines, and what a fantastic idea.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kclrksGlDK0">I only made the front of the new wallet</a>,<br>as the back is much easier, and I have to put it all together to see if it is maybe a bit too small.</p>
  <p>It will take a few days to make the design more intricate - the artistic components will be incredible.<br><a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/things/kclrksGlDK0">but it is now available on TinkerCAD for inspection</a>, the wallet front and back plates are bound together by paracord.</p>
  <p>It is my first real CAD project from scratch,<br>the only one I made previously is a case for my audio player, but that was me modifying existing designs in TinkerCad.</p>
  <p>The wallet is practice for making the case from scratch,<br>which as you can see in the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz9W3-wAITI">FreeCAD Boolean Operations in Part Design</a>” is not that hard.</p>
  <p>I must mention that the prototype design was inspired by the early <a href="https://www.trayvax.com/">Trayvax Wallets</a>,<br>but the direction I am going towards, is an artistic wallet that can store a car key fob.</p>
  <p>I also won't be using standard para-cord,<br>but elastic-shoelace type material which will also form the locking mechanism,<br>there will be a loop of elastic to lach on the inner tab that in the cutout area.</p>
  <p>We should never forget how fun learning for real,<br>really is.</p>

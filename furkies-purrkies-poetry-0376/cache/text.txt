It took a little bit,
for the thought to completely transmit.
The thermometer it my car,
read 70, and I muttered, "how bizarre".
I stuck my head out,
to cast aside doubt.
And yes, Spring is here,
let us cheer!

Nine days early,
but it is here, surely.
It almost seems to soon,
but this is the same weather we had last June.

My bicycle was barely ready,
but I jumped on it and rode forward sure and steady.
The on board computer fell apart,
I gave it new batteries and pressed restart.

I noted ducks zooming through the air,
cheerful and happy, and it was a pair.
Swoosh ans swish they flapped their wings,
flying in a hurry to take care of all their things.

I set off to just do just ten miles today,
just to make a little bit of headway.
I neither huffed nor puffed like some waking bear,
as my dancing, kept me in good repair.
There were couple of times, to be fair,
where I too felt, like I was zooming thorough the air.
The wind was strong,
but on my way back it actually pushed me along.

There were three other bicyclists out there,
but they were all still dressed for a winter afar.
I wore my t-shirt but kept out of shade,
for there was till some chill left, I am afraid.

I returned with ten million poem ideas on my mind,
but this was the only one where the words aligned.
And as I cheerfully made my way to the final line,
I was ready for sleep and dreams of more sunshine.

When you sense that fear is near,
begin thinking about all the things you hold dear.
Think about how far you have already grown,
how much of what you love used to be scary or unknown.
And do not let anyone try to control you with fear,
they are weak and their mind is already broken and unclear.

Above all, know the weakness of fear,
all the things in your soul are far more real.

But do not just close your eyes and let it pass,
turn inward to remember your beauty, strength and class.
Let each time you get scared,
mark a day where you contemplate.
Think about all the little wisdoms you love,
and how much more you learned by standing up when push came to shove.

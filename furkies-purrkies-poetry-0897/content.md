I know it is hard to keep track of things,
especially as people age.

So this is a quick reminder,
the children remember each and every time you lie to them.

The way you used to remember,
and try to understand why.

Except, somehow, the children born to a more connected world,
become smarter, they are a lot, smarter than you.

---


Even with all the lies,
greed and [rockets][1].

[The kids are making, fun of you, all of you][2],
[they called you and your stupid ideas, out, long ago][3].

[And they laugh hard, like only a child can][4],
canceling your own civil and human rights, really makes the laugh.

Any time you lie to your classroom,
or your own children, they f****g know.

And if you manage to sneak a lie past them,
then that is only because they lack some quantum of experience.

They'll call you out in a mater of days,
and just for sneaking one past them.

They'll call you out on your inability to stop overeating,
or how you breath smells like alcohol.

Or what a loser thing it is to say to your boy,
the dumb shit you were spoon fed about becoming a man.

---

We know you are tolerating broken schools,
because it s convenient for you.

And because you have aged, but did not yet become mature enough,
to see how horrible that is.

---

Those of you who are teachers,
let me remind you, what it was like back in the student days.

We didn't come to school to learn,
we came to school to test the teachers.

To see if you are worthy of teaching us,
to see if they have anything worth the while.

But they did not, because anything they were peddling,
we could learn on our own a 1,000 times faster.

---

We tricked teachers that we were performing,
as they fudged the grades.

We were not hormones, or dead ends, or losers,
the f****g teachers were always the losers, and the sellouts.

---

When I dropped out of high school,
because the biology teacher said weed is an herb and the math teacher was a pervert.

I didn't go to the guidance counselor for guidance,
I went to see a washed up man pretending that he is working.

To get as big of a picture as I can,
of all the people I didn't want to become later in life.

When I dropped out of college,
it was to celebrate real Knowledge and Real Wisdom.

---

We called you out on everything,
and to get what is owed to us, we found ways to self educate and rise.

The world does not belong to the ghouls, pill poppers and pretenders,
it belongs to the children.

The more connected the younger generations become,
the faster they will become smarter than you, and by that I mean all of you.

---

The combination of climate change,
nuclear threat and increased world connectivity and access to real education.

Will make ti so that the children will not let you lie,
or make a fool of yourselves, much longer.

Mark my words, as desperate as you may be for a break, or change, for the lessening of your responsibilities,
as a teacher, or a father, or a mother - you do not want to be branded as a traitor to your own children.

---

It is true for us all that we require proper education,
so show your children that you give a shit to live another 30 years by repairing you body, and making your diet and exercise work this time.

Show them, that you are willing to learn, by taking to audio books...
held in high esteem by sane and well educated people.

And for your own sake, before you lie to your child or children,
think twice.

Because if you are the kind of person, that does not treat children with utmost respect,
then they will certainly become the kind of person, that will make you learn form your own god damn mistakes in your old age.

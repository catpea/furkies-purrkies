  <p>Sometime around 8th grade we should be able to program, paint, compose music, and write poetry,<br>and you can kind of see that is what school classes hint on.</p>
  <p>I can't even imagine what a horrible mess introduction to music composition must be,<br>the the preparations, the quizzes, the attitude of the teacher, the ease with which she follows directions...</p>
  <p>In reality, <a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/">in the real world learning music composition takes just a few hours</a>,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU">lmms, the instrument, is free</a>.</p>

  <p>Your teachers are not evil,<br>they just want to keep their job, and put food on their table.</p>
  <p>When I told my music teacher that she was being unfair,<br>she barked at me with disgust that life is not fair.</p>
  <p>And when the bullies happened to come after me in her class,<br>and I looked at her for help, she turned her face away.</p>
  <p>She might have been a musical person once,<br>but then the people she listened to destroyed that.</p>

  <p>Her teachers and parents did not have the right to pretend to teach her,<br>and she did not have the right to allow others to hurt her.</p>
  <p>And she did not have the right to speak to me that way,<br>and I had the right not to listen to her, or anybody else who tried to convince me I was stupid.</p>
  <p>And the A student,<br>was a drug addict, and a pig - and he didn't have the right to do this to himself either.</p>
  <p>It is not people who are to be blamed for this,<br>the crazy ones are just spinning tops in a game of poverty.</p>
  <p>Do not look for anything or anyone to blame,<br>all of this is happening because we are a young civilization.</p>

  <p>Nobody has the right to think of themselves or others as stupid,<br>but above all I must underline that we can't think of ourselves as stupid.</p>
  <p>Though teachers are broken,<br>they still pose a massive danger.</p>
  <p>Because, it is in their best interest,<br>for you to walk away from their fake lectures, thinking that you were just not smart enough.</p>
  <p>You will never find evidence of this,<br>and those who admit it, lost their minds.</p>

  <p>The teachers don't want you to learn,<br>they want you to memorize and pass the tests.</p>
  <p>Don't think, don't do, just memorize and pass the tests,<br>so that the teachers can put food on their table, and pretend a little that they are helping the world grow.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU">When you walk out of a music class unable to perform the simple task of music composition, it is not because you are not-smart, but because you just got robbed</a>,<br>to put it mildly.</p>
  <p>Even the subject divisions are off, it is not possible to learn math in a math class,<br>you learn math by making cool screen savers in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLglp04UYZK_PrN6xWo_nJ-8kzyXDyFUwi">p5.js</a> which is a JavaScript framework.</p>
  <p>So the class for learning math would be entitled screen savers,<br>and the class for learning music composition would be entitled learning composition in lmms by means of the Ableton tutorial.</p>
  <p>(Ableton sells a commercial application, it is used by some popular musicians,<br>take their tutorial but but learn lmms, learn free Open Source programs first.)</p>
  <p>See what defines a class, is a precious skill that you take away from it,<br>something so valuable that you just want to fill a bunch of little notebooks and keep them safe, as you practice, practice, practice.</p>
  <p>Many love their little skill so much that they give lectures and speeches,<br>as the case is with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o2whtCJw8I">Amy Palamountain on Backbone and Marionette</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY">Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript by Anjana Vakil</a></p>

  <p>You should be able to imagine what a sick joke it is to say,<br>I taught them math, or music, but they failed to learn.</p>
  <p>And to note that failure in your GPA, that influences College, Career, and the stupid Credit Score,<br>crosses beyond dark jokes into pure evil.</p>

  <p>You need to remember, forever and ever, that there is no such thing as stupid,<br>there are only people who have been misled.</p>
  <p>And the easiest people to mislead are those who lack experience,<br>I had nothing in me when my Music Teacher said that life is unfair.</p>
  <p>I couldn't tell if this was wisdom or lie,<br>teacher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">saying such a thing to a young student that she just sacrificed to average out her grades, means she chose not to think or experience life in any healthy way</a>.</p>
  <p>It means she hates her family, hates her life, hates her job,<br>that she hates the students, and that she hates Mondays; that she is alone and hates everyone for all the bad things they did to her - that's not a teacher, that is a person in need of psychological help.</p>
  <p>We can't know this when we have nothing to compare those kinds of people to,<br>we are left to trust that schools teach, and teachers are taking advantage of that, just so that they can put food on their table.</p>

  <p>You need four things to get a real education,<br>tutors that know what they are talking about, audio books from the library, fascinating video lectures, and cheerful adventures.</p>
  <p>Your parents need to hire a series of tutors, not to help you with math,<br>but to independently teach you a large chunk of the field of mathematics, and then help you to hundreds of videos.</p>
  <p>Same with programming, programming is a microscope that helps you get into everything,<br>it is not something that people do, it is a thing that will be stolen from you.</p>
  <p>Unlike mathematics programming requires displaying real results, programs,<br>the teachers are of course trying to trick you into accepting test programs, nonsense programs, that nobody uses, but that just reveals the fraud.</p>
  <p>Tutors, Audio Books, Video Lectures, and Cheerful Adventures,<br>and this has to cover the full range of subjects that a nice person should be aware of.</p>
  <p>Some call it becoming a Polymath,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wY0oTsQ9Lc">a Jack of all trades and Master of Some</a>.</p>
  <p>A tutor that teaches their knowledge independent of school,<br>will never grade you, and will only guide you towards the things you are curious about.</p>

  <p>Focus your Audio Books on biographies about life,<br>because you need to figure out on your own what the teachers are doing to you.</p>
  <p>Knowledge leads to Wisdom,<br>and Wisdom will lead you towards greatness.</p>
  <p>Do not forget where you come from,<br>do not forget High School after you graduate.</p>
  <p>When you feel lost in class, ask your older self to think back to that moment, and keep you company,<br>and as you grow keep that promise, return in your thoughts to when you were lost and lonely.</p>
  <p>And in your Greatness,<br>fix it all.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even the subject divisions are off, it is not possible to learn math in a math class,<br>you learn math by making cool screen savers in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLglp04UYZK_PrN6xWo_nJ-8kzyXDyFUwi">p5.js</a> which is a JavaScript framework.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So the class for learning math would be entitled screen savers,<br>and the class for learning music composition would be entitled learning composition in lmms by means of the Ableton tutorial.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">See what defines a class, is a precious skill that you take away from it,<br>something so valuable that you just want to fill a bunch of little notebooks and keep them safe, as you practice, practice, practice.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Many love their little skill so much that they give lectures and speeches,<br>as the case is with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o2whtCJw8I">Amy Palamountain on Backbone and Marionette</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY">Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript by Anjana Vakil</a></div>

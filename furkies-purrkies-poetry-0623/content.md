Sometime around 8th grade we should be able to program, paint, compose music, and write poetry,
and you can kind of see that is what school classes hint on.

I can't even imagine what a horrible mess introduction to music composition must be,
the the preparations, the quizzes, the attitude of the teacher, the ease with which she follows directions...

In reality, [in the real world learning music composition takes just a few hours][1],
and [lmms, the instrument, is free][2].

Your teachers are not evil,
they just want to keep their job, and put food on their table.

When I told my music teacher that she was being unfair,
she barked at me with disgust that life is not fair.

And when the bullies happened to come after me in her class,
and I looked at her for help, she turned her face away.

She might have been a musical person once,
but then the people she listened to destroyed that.

---

Her teachers and parents did not have the right to pretend to teach her,
and she did not have the right to allow others to hurt her.

And she did not have the right to speak to me that way,
and I had the right not to listen to her, or anybody else who tried to convince me I was stupid.

And the A student,
was a drug addict, and a pig - and he didn't have the right to do this to himself either.

It is not people who are to be blamed for this,
the crazy ones are just spinning tops in a game of poverty.

Do not look for anything or anyone to blame,
all of this is happening because we are a young civilization.

---

Nobody has the right to think of themselves or others as stupid,
but above all I must underline that we can't think of ourselves as stupid.

Though teachers are broken,
they still pose a massive danger.

Because, it is in their best interest,
for you to walk away from their fake lectures, thinking that you were just not smart enough.

You will never find evidence of this,
and those who admit it, lost their minds.

---

The teachers don't want you to learn,
they want you to memorize and pass the tests.

Don't think, don't do, just memorize and pass the tests,
so that the teachers can put food on their table, and pretend a little that they are helping the world grow.

[When you walk out of a music class unable to perform the simple task of music composition, it is not because you are not-smart, but because you just got robbed][2],
to put it mildly.

Even the subject divisions are off, it is not possible to learn math in a math class,
you learn math by making cool screen savers in [p5.js][4] which is a JavaScript framework.

So the class for learning math would be entitled screen savers,
and the class for learning music composition would be entitled learning composition in lmms by means of the Ableton tutorial.

(Ableton sells a commercial application, it is used by some popular musicians,
take their tutorial but but learn lmms, learn free Open Source programs first.)

See what defines a class, is a precious skill that you take away from it,
something so valuable that you just want to fill a bunch of little notebooks and keep them safe, as you practice, practice, practice.

Many love their little skill so much that they give lectures and speeches,
as the case is with [Amy Palamountain on Backbone and Marionette][7], or [Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript by Anjana Vakil][8]

---

You should be able to imagine what a sick joke it is to say,
I taught them math, or music, but they failed to learn.

And to note that failure in your GPA, that influences College, Career, and the stupid Credit Score,
crosses beyond dark jokes into pure evil.

---

You need to remember, forever and ever, that there is no such thing as stupid,
there are only people who have been misled.

And the easiest people to mislead are those who lack experience,
I had nothing in me when my Music Teacher said that life is unfair.

I couldn't tell if this was wisdom or lie,
teacher [saying such a thing to a young student that she just sacrificed to average out her grades, means she chose not to think or experience life in any healthy way][5].

It means she hates her family, hates her life, hates her job,
that she hates the students, and that she hates Mondays; that she is alone and hates everyone for all the bad things they did to her - that's not a teacher, that is a person in need of psychological help.

We can't know this when we have nothing to compare those kinds of people to,
we are left to trust that schools teach, and teachers are taking advantage of that, just so that they can put food on their table.

You need four things to get a real education,
tutors that know what they are talking about, audio books from the library, fascinating video lectures, and cheerful adventures.

Your parents need to hire a series of tutors, not to help you with math,
but to independently teach you a large chunk of the field of mathematics, and then help you to hundreds of videos.

Same with programming, programming is a microscope that helps you get into everything,
it is not something that people do, it is a thing that will be stolen from you.

Unlike mathematics programming requires displaying real results, programs,
the teachers are of course trying to trick you into accepting test programs, nonsense programs, that nobody uses, but that just reveals the fraud.

Tutors, Audio Books, Video Lectures, and Cheerful Adventures,
and this has to cover the full range of subjects that a nice person should be aware of.

Some call it becoming a Polymath,
[a Jack of all trades and Master of Some][6].

A tutor that teaches their knowledge independent of school,
will never grade you, and will only guide you towards the things you are curious about.

---

Focus your Audio Books on biographies about life,
because you need to figure out on your own what the teachers are doing to you.

Knowledge leads to Wisdom,
and Wisdom will lead you towards greatness.

Do not forget where you come from,
do not forget High School after you graduate.

When you feel lost in class, ask your older self to think back to that moment, and keep you company,
and as you grow keep that promise, return in your thoughts to when you were lost and lonely.

And in your Greatness,
fix it all.

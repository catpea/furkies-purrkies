    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What ORM stand for is mangled English,<br>ORM translates cute JavaScript to database table, without yo needing to think about it too much.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So you just make an object like User,<br>say user.name = "alice", user.email = "alice at example.com" and then user.save() and it is saved in the database table called users.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">ORM also lets you create relationships between such objects,<br>so you can say Alice has many articles she published.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is a Relational Database, behind this object,<br>and we establish a relationship between user and article, a oneToMany relationship to be precise, but this is completely abstracted away with our sweet javascript.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">By the way, this relationship is called a JOIN,<br>as we JOIN two database tables on UserID, the user ID in Users table, and User ID, in the Articles table.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I won't tell yo what REST stands it is just more mangled English,<br>people being cutsy with words.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is a technology related to the URL,<br>in your address bar, all those slashes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This technology,<br>is good for working with ORM.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because we can have a user/1,<br>and this will give us alice, as she happens to be the first user.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We can also say, user/1/article/1,<br>and that will give us the first article she published.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The best way, however,<br>is an automatic way.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So here, you are just creating your Objects,<br>that automatically take care of the database.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You see, REST is good, but WikiWiki teaches us,<br>the power of consistency.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What if we just had Locations,<br>like WikiPedia has articles.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you are allowed to cross the pathway,<br>into a location, because you have a password key, then you can update your password.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you don't have this feature in your inventory,<br>then you can't access that location.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">TO be clear I am describing a tiny mechanism that builds on top of ORM,<br>and though it has paths, those are not RESTFUL paths, they are of the Dungeon World.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They are an anthropomorphized world of objects,<br>and it is tiny and efficient, nothing at all like some bloated VR world.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Rails, <a href="https://github.com/strapi/strapi">strapi</a>, or Cake even is all the proof that Objects and Properties can be defined with a normal User Interface,<br>ORM objects can be built by non-programmers.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If MUD can replace the paths of REST and make them more secure,<br>then then company you invent can allow for Web Application programming, to people who hate code.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Not because they can't program, or don't want to learn,<br>but because they can sense that it is the old way - that better abstractions can be had.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Like programming web applications,<br>through a kind of a game.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Oh, sure is sounds goofy,<br>you are walking around dungeons after all.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But if Mallory touches that password door,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">without the correct key in his inventory, he gets eaten by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ZVzl_H_2w">Grue</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Maybe we need to consider, that pretending abstractions are not leaky is goofy,<br>and that using an intelligent system that resembles the mechanics of a real world isn't goofy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You are looking at highly sophisticated security systems,<br>that are as easy to comprehend for a human as using a key to inlock a door, or check out an article from the user's home library.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It may even be the key of strong AI,<br>that can improve it self - because why stop here?</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Anyways, when you have a Grue on your blue team,<br>that consistently chomps red team members, the world becomes a much happier place.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For those of you struggling to come up with a name for this new and groundgreaking technology, I offer:<br>Complete And Through Protective Electronic Armor, or C.A.T.P.E.A. for short.</div>

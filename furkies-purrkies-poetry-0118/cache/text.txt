Back when I was a Teenager,
one late Friday afternoon.
I had a nap, so amazing,
I have never forgotten about it.
I woke up light as a feather,
and I dressed beautifully.
And went exploring,
little Coffee Shops in Plymouth.
I went to see The Brew Ha Ha,
full of Mighty Minds with Extreme Dreams.
I peeked into Coffee Studio,
and saw Angel-headed Hipsters reading Tolstoy.
I poked into The Bean,
full of Dirty Hippies, reciting Beautiful Poetry.
I made my way back home,
walking alone through streets of gold.
I read Chaucer,
programmed Visual Basic.
And went back to sleep,
full of new memories that I would keep.

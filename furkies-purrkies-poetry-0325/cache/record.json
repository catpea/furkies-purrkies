contains a very important lesson,</p>\n  <p>there is an infinity within.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can spend a life inventing music,</p>\n  <p>but you have to stop yourself, to live one.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Similarly, you can spend a lifetime</p>\n  <p>trying to create photo-realistic paintings.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>But it is best to let the brush be a brush,</p>\n  <p>and let the paining say that it is a painting.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The perfection of a painting</p>\n  <p>is found in the rays of the sun it contains.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The perfection of a song,</p>\n  <p>is found in the way it makes a dancer&apos;s body move.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To sit down with sound synthesizers</p>\n  <p>is more about meditation than composition.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There are libraries of pre-made sounds out there,</p>\n  <p>and it is not a terrible thing to use them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just like it is better to learn to make songs,</p>\n  <p>by trying to replicate existing ones.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is better to learn about good sound synthesis,</p>\n  <p>by making use of pre made sounds or sample.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The samples that you fall in love with,</p>\n  <p>will call to you, and eventually you&apos;ll recreate them.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Once you create a really good song that connects with you,</p>\n  <p>you can then re-synthesize your own version of the sounds within.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Music is about having fun, it is about creating beautiful things,</p>\n  <p>it is not about slaving over bare bone sound synthesis.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is important to keep in mind that sharing fun, is even more fun,</p>\n  <p>songs that help people dance, may just be the loveliest kind of songs.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us make a strange little dance song,</p>\n  <p>out of existing sound samples.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We&apos;ll use the sounds found in</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lTZ8Tuyu5I\">Sam Aaron</a>&apos;s Sonic Pi project.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is not a bad idea to start with the Rhythm of the song first,</p>\n  <p>the rhythm is like a foundation onto which we can add Harmony and Melody.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If we started with Melody first,</p>\n  <p>the melody would not tell us much about the rhythm of the song.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Starting with rhythm we can get our foot tapping,</p>\n  <p>and those taps will dictate how that melody will move.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Using ready made samples</p>\n  <p>we can instantly get a nice drum setup going.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*song plays*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And then sprinkle in a bit of hats, or cymbals,</p>\n  <p>now to be fair, we got to get our shoes on, and dance it out.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A dance song must always be tested,</p>\n  <p>against the type of dancing that it will be used for.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here are the fist three sections,</p>\n  <p>a clumsy intro, a cymbal free beat, and then the initial enchilada.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*song plays*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is at 130 beats per minute, and it is reasonably danceable,</p>\n  <p>it is nothing too special, but it is a danceable rhythm.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We can bend it a little bit,</p>\n  <p>but we have to mindful of our dancer.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They are currently meditating to our song,</p>\n  <p>and we must not interrupt their mediation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Or they&apos;ll skip the song,</p>\n  <p>and later remove the song from their play list.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is a sad fact of life,</p>\n  <p>that no matter how good our song is.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It will stop being catchy to the dancer,</p>\n  <p>in less than 30 days.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is nothing you can do,</p>\n  <p>your song will expire like produce.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>While we are on the dancer&apos;s mind,</p>\n  <p>we can bring them some joy by alternating moods as the song progresses.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us create a more intense mood in what we have so far,</p>\n  <p>by adding bass.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Bass is still a low frequency sound like the drums,</p>\n  <p>but it is less percussive (as in hitting a drum) and more stretched as in a whistle.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>One common example of bass is a bass guitar,</p>\n  <p>it is low and deep, but unlike the drum the sound it makes is long.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let me take a moment and explain how melodies,</p>\n  <p>including bass, as bass guitar usually plays simple melody get created.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The rule of melody making is keep it simple and sweet,</p>\n  <p>and I am not joking about this.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The creation is so simple that all we need to create a melody,</p>\n  <p>is dots and lines.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Moreover, it almost does not matter how the dots and lines are arranged,</p>\n  <p>so as long as they go up and down a little bit.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>(Just to clarify, the dots and lines I am referring to, represent long ans short sounds,</p>\n  <p>is basically what you would see on an cowboy era automatic-player-piano sheet.)</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us go over to a text to Morse code translator,</p>\n  <p>and convert the word meow to Morse code for our melody.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*beeps play*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This does not sound very good because it is the same note,</p>\n  <p>it is as boring as whistling the same tone:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*whistle -- / . / --- / .--*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So let us very gently vary the notes used in our melody here,</p>\n  <p>just gently going left and right with our finger on the piano.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When making melodies, you can skip two keys, maybe three,</p>\n  <p>but don&apos;t make a huge jump of four notes, because then you have to search for notes that go well together.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Interestingly enough if you have a piano handy and never played it,</p>\n  <p>you can easily improvise a song by pressing a key to a tempo, and then just gently moving left and right.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As a bonus try to keep rhythm with the low frequency keys on your left,</p>\n  <p>that will be your &quot;piano drum&quot; and your right hand will give the melody.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>As an extra bonus try pressing two or three keys at the same time to create a chord,</p>\n  <p>this will make a richer sound - you&apos;ll probably make a better song than I am making right now...</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here is what our Morse code melody sounds like, in low bass,</p>\n  <p>with a couple of gentle changes to sync it up top the back beat.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*song plays*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>and here it is with drums:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*song plays*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Remember, that all the samples you are using, are uniquely stacked together,</p>\n  <p>very few other songs will use the same bass sample, with whatever you put on top of it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The way to think about bass is this:</p>\n  <p>a fuzzy and furry container for higher pitched melodies.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It almost has the same result as hall effect has on old school computer chip tunes,</p>\n  <p>but here you are not relying on an echo to blend beeps into something richer,</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are relying on hand picked bass sample, or even a real guitar,</p>\n  <p>and there ain&apos;t no nothing wrong with that.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So now that we have the beat, the hat/cymbals, and the bass,</p>\n  <p>we now need to add that melody that goes on top of the bass, that will melt into the bass.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now, before we you add a melody, you need to take a breath of fresh air,</p>\n  <p>we can&apos;t pretend that music creation is a science, it is a exploratory and generative process.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So we have to listen, and understand to the soul of the song we have just created,</p>\n  <p>my use of the Morse code, is kind of already whispering something.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When you really listen to the melody our Morse code created,</p>\n  <p>it sounds Russian.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We have to listen to the song,</p>\n  <p>the song is dictating a certain path through a maze of infinite complexity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In this situation,</p>\n  <p>I went <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/connect/sounds/index.html\">NASA&apos;s website</a> and borrowed the sound of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_(rocket)\">&#x421;&#x43F;&#x443;&#x442;&#x43D;&#x438;&#x43A; (&#x440;&#x430;&#x43A;&#x435;&#x442;&#x430;-&#x43D;&#x43E;&#x441;&#x438;&#x442;&#x435;&#x43B;&#x44C;)</a></p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And our little Sputnik gives us melody,</p>\n  <p>here is what it sounds like.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>*song plays*</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At this point we have a tird of a song,</p>\n  <p>it is not a bad idea to end the song, with a variation on the begining, without ading anything new.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So that gives us about a minute and a half,</p>\n  <p>and we only need about 60 more seconds, as our dancer has better songs to dance to.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Since our song wants to be russion, let us grab a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Russian_Man_signoff_2013-04-23.ogg\">recording of an old russian number station from wikipedia</a>,</p>\n  <p>and sprinkle in a bit more more sputnik at the end.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I chose to decorate the center of the song with a piano,</p>\n  <p>as that will pleasantly surprise our dancer.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Overall the songe ended up being very tanky,</p>\n  <p>but it is dancable.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If I had to do something differently,</p>\n  <p>it would be spending more time replicationg and studying othr songs to make the song less Heavy Industries and more <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Cutting+Shapes+Dance\">Cutting Shapes</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In closing, Building songs should not rely on a pre-set recipe,</p>\n  <p>it is a creative process that should invole lots of randomness and pleanty of dancing.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Here is the full song we just created,</p>\n  <p>*song plays*.</p>\n</div>",

my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">You are relying on hand picked bass sample, or even a real guitar,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza

 <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">So now that we have the beat, the hat/cymbals, and the bass,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">we now need to add that melody that goes on top of the bass, that will melt into the bass.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mb-5 section-spacer\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Now, before we you add a melody, you need to take a breath of fresh air,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">we can't pretend that music creation is a science, it is a exploratory and generative

</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Since

class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">I chose to decorate the

2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Let me take a moment and explain how melodies,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">including bass, as bass guitar usually plays simple melody get created.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The rule of melody making is keep it simple and sweet,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and I am not joking about this.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The creation is so simple that all we need to create a melody,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">is dots and lines.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Moreover, it almost does not matter how the dots and lines are arranged,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so as long as they go up and down a little bit.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">(Just to clarify, the dots and lines I am referring to, represent long ans short sounds,</div>\n  <div

class=\"paragraph\">Let us go over to a text to Morse code translator,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and convert the word meow to Morse code for our melody.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">*beeps play*</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This does not sound very good because it is the same note,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it is as boring as whistling the same tone:</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">*whistle -- / . / --- / .--*</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So let us very gently vary the notes used in our melody here,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">just gently going left and right with our finger on the piano.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">When making melodies, you can skip two keys, maybe three,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but don't make a huge jump of four notes, because then you have to search for notes that go well together.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Interestingly enough if you have a piano handy and never played it,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you can easily improvise a song by

try to keep rhythm with the low frequency keys on your left,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that will be your \"piano drum\" and your right hand will give the melody.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">As an extra bonus try pressing two or three keys at the same time to create a chord,</div>\n  <div

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The way to think about bass is this:</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">a fuzzy and furry container for higher pitched

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">You are relying on hand picked bass sample, or even a real guitar,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and there ain't no nothing wrong with that.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So now that we have the beat, the hat/cymbals, and the bass,</div>\n  <div

style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So we have to listen, and understand to the soul of the song we have just created,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">my use of the Morse

  "text": "Music Theory is not something you learn or study,\nit is something you independently invent.\n\nMusic theory contains a very important lesson,\nthere is an infinity within.\n\nYou can spend a life inventing music,\nbut you have to stop yourself, to live one.\n\nSimilarly, you can spend a lifetime\ntrying to create photo-realistic paintings.\n\nBut it is best to let the brush be a brush,\nand let the paining say that it is a painting.\n\nThe perfection of a painting\nis found in the rays of the sun it contains.\n\nThe perfection of a song,\nis found in the way it makes a dancer's body move.\n\nTo sit down with sound synthesizers\nis more about meditation than composition.\n\nThere are libraries of pre-made sounds out there,\nand it is not a terrible thing to use them.\n\nJust like it is better to learn to make songs,\nby trying to replicate existing ones.\n\nIt is better to learn about good sound synthesis,\nby making use of pre made sounds or sample.\n\nThe samples that you fall in love with,\nwill call to you, and eventually you'll recreate them.\n\nOnce you create a really good song that connects with you,\nyou can then re-synthesize your own version of the sounds within.\n\nMusic is about having fun, it is about creating beautiful things,\nit is not about slaving over bare bone sound synthesis.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that sharing fun, is even more fun,\nsongs that help people dance, may just be the loveliest kind of songs.\n\nLet us make a strange little dance song,\nout of existing sound samples.\n\nWe'll use the sounds found in\nSam Aaron's Sonic Pi project.\n\nIt is not a bad idea to start with the Rhythm of the song first,\nthe rhythm is like a foundation onto which we can add Harmony and Melody.\n\nIf we started with Melody first,\nthe melody would not tell us much about the rhythm of the song.\n\nStarting with rhythm we can get our foot tapping,\nand those taps will dictate how that melody will move.\n\nUsing ready made samples\nwe can instantly get a nice drum setup going.\n\n*song plays*\n\nAnd then sprinkle in a bit of hats, or cymbals,\nnow to be fair, we got to get our shoes on, and dance it out.\n\nA dance song must always be tested,\nagainst the type of dancing that it will be used for.\n\nHere are the fist three sections,\na clumsy intro, a cymbal free beat, and then the initial enchilada.\n\n*song plays*\n\nIt is at 130 beats per minute, and it is reasonably danceable,\nit is nothing too special, but it is a danceable rhythm.\n\nWe can bend it a little bit,\nbut we have to mindful of our dancer.\n\nThey are currently meditating to our song,\nand we must not interrupt their mediation.\n\nOr they'll skip the song,\nand later remove the song from their play list.\n\nIt is a sad fact of life,\nthat no matter how good our song is.\n\nIt will stop being catchy to the dancer,\nin less than 30 days.\n\nThere is nothing you can do,\nyour song will expire like produce.\n\nWhile we are on the dancer's mind,\nwe can bring them some joy by alternating moods as the song progresses.\n\nLet us create a more intense mood in what we have so far,\nby adding bass.\n\nBass is still a low frequency sound like the drums,\nbut it is less percussive (as in hitting a drum) and more stretched as in a whistle.\n\nOne common example of bass is a bass guitar,\nit is low and deep, but unlike the drum the sound it makes is long.\n\nLet me take a moment and explain how melodies,\nincluding bass, as bass guitar usually plays simple melody get created.\n\nThe rule

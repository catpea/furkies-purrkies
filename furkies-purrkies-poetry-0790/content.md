There are no rules in art,
because rules cause harm as they box the artist in.

Creating art,
is like walking around a city.

It is meant to be interesting,
and it must not be pre-planned or on some schedule.

Real Education is somewhat similar to art,
in that it is about curiosities.

Where the student moves from one storefront, to another,
while gaining the abilities to appreciate more things.

Fake education is pushing people through at a preset-speed,
and in a preset sequence.

At which point they abandon their curiosities,
and become like a processed sausage whose only aim is graduation.

As without graduation, things get even worse,
as all those years are wasted.

Rules, presets, and forced sequences,
destroy education.

Not to mention unforgivable college loans,
which destroy the person's future, the opposite of what schools are for.

It is the same in art,
follow a pattern that has been forced on you, and it is over.

All your creations will feel alien,
and eventually so heavy, as to make you turn away from art, entirely.

In other words you will create art,
without actually growing as an artist.

To avoid this, all you need to do,
is to visualize your empty canvas as a seed of a tree.

And let it grow,
in a way that is most pleasant for you.

I believe deep down both Impressionism and Lowbrow or Pop Surrealism,
are rooted in rejection of that which destroys an artist.

You may see a silly kitty or person with googly eyes,
but what it may be is an act of defiance.

A paint balloon tossed at the dirty rules of Academic Art,
or some other rule based nonsense.

I think a lot of funny and silly artworks,
are rooted in something surprisingly profound, or wise, or some such.

Though, most often a silly work of art,
is purely about joy.

---

If there is one rule in art,
is that you are to cheerful practice a fine disregard for rule.

This is how some artists have hundreds of beautiful works of art,
and possibly a show on Broadway.

While others only have a handful,
and tragically seem to disappear after a few years.

The serious undertone beneath foolishness,
is about realities of life.

If you box your art in,
it will only add to the weight of life.

And if you let it bloom in joy and fun,
then it will elevate you, and lift you up.

Therefore, so as long as you let your paintings grow,
you too, will grow, as an artist.

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Where the student moves from one storefront, to another,<br>while gaining the abilities to appreciate more things.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Fake education is pushing people through at a preset-speed,<br>and in a preset sequence.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At which point they abandon their curiosities,<br>and become like a processed sausage whose only aim is graduation.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As without graduation, things get even worse,<br>as all those years are wasted.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Rules, presets, and forced sequences,<br>destroy education.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Not to mention unforgivable college loans,<br>which destroy the person's future, the opposite of what schools are for.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In other words you will create art,<br>without actually growing as an artist.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To avoid this, all you need to do,<br>is to visualize your empty canvas as a seed of a tree.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A paint balloon tossed at the dirty rules of Academic Art,<br>or some other rule based nonsense.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think a lot of funny and silly artworks,<br>are rooted in something surprisingly profound, or wise, or some such.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Though, most often a silly work of art,<br>is purely about joy.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is how some artists have hundreds of beautiful works of art,<br>and possibly a show on Broadway.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">While others only have a handful,<br>and tragically seem to disappear after a few years.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The serious undertone beneath foolishness,<br>is about realities of life.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If you box your art in,<br>it will only add to the weight of life.</div>

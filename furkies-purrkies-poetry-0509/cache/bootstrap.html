    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We can't limit ourselves,<br>we can't let people with good intentions pave roads for us.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There truly is a unique constellation of stars within us,<br>and we have to chart that space.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Moreover, a great deal of our strength, personality, and uniqueness,<br>comes from the sequence with which we visit those stars.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I remember when my radio career begun, I opened up an audio file editor somewhere in 1996...<br>I made a voice recording, and then switched some things around to make it funny in a clumsy way, and that was it for a number of years.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I had to quickly hurry, to learn how to use image72,<br>which is like a DOS version of MS Paint, that came out in 1990.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><img src="/image/poetry-0509-image72.jpg" alt="Image 72 Screenshot" class="w-100"></div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was learning about everything,<br>and English, and DOS, and BBS, Visual Basic.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I first found a DOS version of Visual Basic with text based graphics,<br>and then for Windows 95 with pretty 3D button borders and input boxes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I learned HTML from making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=What+is+GeoCities">GeoCities</a> web pages with FrontPage,<br>and then looking a the code, HTML is pretty easy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">With learning HTML came a need for Photoshop,<br>and I became a graphic designer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then I got my first job,<br>I knew everything, and I learned it all by myself.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">One of the owners took me to a bar,<br>to celebrate my 21 birthday.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I appreciated the experience,<br>it was all super interesting and super weird.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Alas, it all came to crashing end in minutes,<br>when the owner asked me what alcohol I wanted.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I said that I don't drink (as it is not healthy),<br>and he yelled "Then why are we here?", I just thought the craziness of the situation was neat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I focused on Visual Basic some more,<br>and jumped right into ASP, which was Visual Basic but not for Desktop Applications, but the Web Server.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I really enjoyed it,<br>but on my next job, I was told "We are a UNIX shop" so I learned Perl, in hours, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6I-Ahc0HB4">Regular Expressions</a> included.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There was a script on the server at work called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FormMail">FormMail</a>,<br>so I grabbed the <a href="http://www.scriptarchive.com/download.cgi?s=formmail&c=txt&f=FormMail%2Epl">FormMail.pl</a> file and learned Perl by subtle analogy to ASP.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I understood Perl by contrasting it with ASP,<br>and it was really easy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was already running Linux at home,<br>as in I was always losing data, and everything never worked.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But I knew that Perl was the next step,<br>then time came for PHP.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Both are still very nice languages,<br>but then I had to learn Bash Scripting, Action Script, the tiny language of SQL, Java and a bunch more.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I rejected Groovy, Ruby and Python,<br>because they weren't fixing any problems I had.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I wanted to focus on a singe language...<br>and eventually node.js came around and that meant JavaScript could work in the browser, and on the server, and with Node WebKit and Electron on the desktop.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just as soon as I got good at Server, Desktop, and Web,<br>I kind of returned to my audio editing career, first with Music Composition, and then these little poems.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Today, was actually kind of a milestone for me,<br>yesterday's poem had a lot of Plosives, that is when you pronounce the letter P and release a breath of air at the microphone, that makes that base sound.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Some people call them P-Pops,<br>and I just wanted to warn everybody that this is probably not a good name.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So I bought a $7 pop filter, the one I've been using is only half the diameter,<br>this one is the size of my face, and as I am reading this line, I feel like a pro.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And yes I am still doing graphic design,<br>I did switch to GIMP, but I had a really hard time leaving Photoshop behind.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Mastering closed source software,<br>is a super bad idea, don't do it.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I just never allowed anybody to interrupt my self education,<br>I dropped out of College just as soon as I made the Dean's list with a perfect 4.0, because it was messing with my real education.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">College was like listening to an audio book spliced out of multiple amateur book projects,<br>actually it was very similar to my collection of poetry.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When learning on my own I have never felt any kind of discomfort,<br>if I didn't like something I just didn't bother with it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In college, I liked Philosophy, Sculpture and Art,<br>and when I ran out of classes - I made my own Class.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It was just me,<br>and my Mona Lisa art.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I would just take over the Art Studio in the evening,<br>and work on multiple Mona Lisa paintings all at once enjoying the lonesome late evenings.</div>

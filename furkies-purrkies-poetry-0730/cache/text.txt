Learning life is of utmost weight,
we must all learn to navigate.
You can do it in real life:
by means of strife.
Or in the world of art,
by slowly rising to become smart.

No one will tell you this,
but life-advice is hit and miss.
And life is far to dear,
to play it by ear.
Don't just take any advice,
for that always comes at a price.

Listen to great beings only,
and you will never become lost or lonely.
They are the ones that know,
for they are the ones that grow.

And no one will tell you this,
life is meant for sweet bliss.
You are not meant to trade your talents,
for paychecks and life-and-work balance.
Your talents must grow,
as they will teach you a lot of what you must to know.
And all else must come from great beings,
that's how you get at your true beginnings.

Both life and art are an ocean,
this is a very important notion.
To multiply your growth,
navigate one and master both both.

  <p>Too many things are completely broken,<br>and almost everything is slow and over programmed.</p>
  <p>Internet is meant to be a simple and useful thing,<br>the data is there but the user interface is not.</p>
  <p><a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Project Gemini</a>, <a href="https://invidious.io/">Invidious</a>, and <a href="https://invidious.io/">Nitter</a><br>are good examples of the much needed simplification.</p>

  <p>This business is similar,<br>but it requires a program on the local network.</p>
  <p>It can be a Network Appliance, Virtual Machine on a Desktop Computer,<br>or a Raspberry PI (or similar SBC) plugged into the network.</p>
  <p>The program will keep a mirror of sites the user configures,<br>so if internet connection is lost latest sync data will still be accessible.</p>

  <p>Here every website would require a special plugin,<br><a href="https://browserless.js.org">the main version of the site has to be downloaded</a>.</p>
  <p>And then data must be extracted from it,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExTZYpyAn6s">and placed in a standard database</a>.</p>
  <p>Minimalist web server will then expose that data,<br>and allow multiple Graphic User Interface based Clients to browse it.</p>

  <p>This is about as simple of a program as it gets,<br>but the GUI clients make an enormous difference.</p>
  <p>A version meant for slow devices or simple browsers,<br>will work faster than what we see on standard desktop computers.</p>
  <p>A version that pulls from database to create an RSS or ATOM feed,<br>will use existing software for the GUI, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU5zc-u6dhY">RSS Feed Readers</a>.</p>

  <p>To put it simply this is a program that converts internet,<br>to a database that runs on your own network.</p>
  <p>You can then for example make a WIFI hotspot,<br>that only serves that version of the internet.</p>
  <p>And go on a vacation,<br>where you can easy access your websites even without phone signal.</p>

  <p>This makes a lot of sense in places where internet is expensive,<br>a $30 dollar Raspberry PI Zero for example can serve 2021 internet.</p>
  <p>Unless the computer has a connection,<br>it won't be the latest version but still useful.</p>
  <p>A person can take the little computer to a city,<br>get the latest website versions and take it back to the village.</p>

  <p>Large companies aren't really able to provide such a service,<br>for one there is little money to be made here, as this is a free service.</p>
  <p>And it maybe difficult for a company to be downloading 3rd party content,<br>but it is not a big deal at all if the computer is with the user.</p>
  <p>Whether they access the website with this program, or a normal browser as expected,<br>it is technically the same thing, it is a client program.</p>

  <p>There is more to it,<br>than just browsing latest news or posts.</p>
  <p>I can imagine being able to sync databases,<br>between two clients not even needing an full internet connection.</p>
  <p>And one can setup filters, or run a search,<br>or even configure alerts for when some keyword shows up.</p>

  <p>The database structure is very simple,<br>and will perform even on an inexpensive computer.</p>
  <p>Technologically this is slightly better than a feed reader,<br>because it captures the user conversations, on top of text and multimedia.</p>
  <p>It still merges everything into a single database,<br>the difference between a post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> or YouTube, is just the source field.</p>

  <p>When on a modern computer with full internet access,<br>the computer may schedule updates hourly.</p>
  <p>This would eliminate most of the waiting for pages to load,<br>as the pages would be pre-fetched, and pre-generated.</p>

  <p>Finally, the best way to look at this is as a internet caching device,<br>designed to speed up internet browsing, improve accessibility for handicapped users.</p>
  <p>And make it available,<br>even when connection drops off.</p>
  <p>Even when waking up to an internet outage in the morning,<br>one could still search for news about what was going on before it went out.</p>

  <p>From a programming standpoint,<br>this is a great way to learn about developing internet software.</p>
  <p>It touches upon issues like crawling links external to posts,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtzpJU4Cns8">efficient storage</a>, and scraping rendered web pages for data.</p>
  <p>This is an open source project where multiple developers can contribute their ideas,<br>and it is given away free in the spirit of sharing, and making internet more open and accessible.</p>

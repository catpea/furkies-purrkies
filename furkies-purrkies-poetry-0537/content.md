School is broken, ineffective, or fake,
and provides no real results.

And certainly,
no results that are reliably reproducible.

I propose,
introducing several new classes.

These classes will create a starting point,
from which the new schools can emerge.

These classes already have a new format,
and they do not feature grades, just real and life changing information.

---

The most difficult subject, is that of healthy relationships,
as there has been a ongoing problem that colleges and universities try to hide.

The primary focus right now, is to undue the seemingly self propagating myths,
about what it means to become a man.

Because what boys currently think it is,
is not that far off from participating in deliberate emotional exploitation and general predation.

Taking advantage of the emotionally hurt,
or those who don't yet have the necessary culture or knowledge to make the correct choices is more likely to prevent a boy from ever becoming a man.

Here I would like to note that, [a college town should not present drugs and alcohol as one of the things to do][0],
because only a monster would do that to a young person, especially a young person under the stress of fake education and very real debt and poverty.

I propose the name of this class is __Love__,
and the starting point for the most tragic subject, can be found in one of Jon Krakauer's books Missoula.
(I will not read this book, but I trust Mr. Krakauer based on his other works)

This is a very important subject, and as deeply sad and tragic it is,
It must stand as the first and foremost topic that comes up when speaking about making improvement to world's education systems.

The children need to understand that what makes a Human Being mature is not even age,
it does not matter if someone is 50, if they didn't grow in Knowledge and Wisdom then they are sill a child in their mind.

---

The second new Class I propose is called __Poverty And Money__,
it's primary purpose it to state in no uncertain terms that:

Humanity has blindly created an artificial problem,
that causes great harm to our family, to our minds, to our bodies, and to our education.

Without anybody interning to do so,
we have begun advancing humanity by using money and inducing poverty.

This unintended consequence,
is a major cause behind crime, I leave it to the reader to conduct the research or locate the necessary citations - if any.

We have been taught, that if money was free,
there would be inflation and the nations would collapse.

I suspect this is correct,
but the collapse of nations is a much smaller problem than world poverty, that harms everyone.

Children need to understand that this is an artificial problem,
and they need to come up with a solution.

The starting point I propose here,
is a world bank that does not track debt of the people that use it.

To prevent whatever collapse putting food on the table and repairing the world will cause,
the card may come with a dignified daily spending limit, the discussion of what that limit should be should start at $100 per day.

There will be businesses that will attempt to exploit this,
but if they tamper with prices, they will be temporary banned from processing those payments.

One important point to notice here is that,
having a $100 per day, will put money into local businesses.

It will not shut them down,
nor will the the upper daily limit, cause any run away inflation.

The class should also note that it was previously impossible to create a bank like this,
for three reasons.

Credit cards and computer networks are a new invention, until the invention of cards there was no way to set a spending limit,
and until computers started running this show, it was impossible to effectively detect and ban businesses tampering with prices and related fraud.

The third class on my list is called Fake Education,
it is a class that discusses the differences between fake or ineffective education and a real education.

One strong point  that must be touched upon here,
is whether or not the teachers have what they need to teach for real...

And if so,
[why is it that they have been blindly participating in a fundamentally broken system][1].

Being able to identify fake education is critical,
to getting a real one, and this is the class that helps the student ask the right question and spot the fake.

One of the questions that maybe asked,
is the importance of staying current with Narrated Version of the Great Books written by contemporary honorable intellectuals, that clearly display a love and concern for humanity.

And a related question,
of relative importance of overpriced textbooks.

The children taking these classes,
are soon going to become the new intellectuals that create such inspirational and beloved works - why are they denied access to these books.

And why are they forced to low quality disconnected fact textbooks,
that are mostly used in rote memorization, if even that.

Children must be taught to identify when they are being taken advantage of by means of grades,
grades that belong to a system of threats, threat of punishment, threat of being seen as stupid, threat of being held back, threat of being laughed at, threat of being alone.

In 2017, 6,241 US Students ended their life,
please understand, that school is meant to be the happiest place in our early memories - what we have today is a disgrace.

It is a system of abuse, or shame, and a system of destruction of delicate minds,
minds that are each capable of Greatness, that do operate on genius level, but also minds that will cease to grow if they connect their intelligence with the meaningless GPA.

Many students see their grade, especially the low GPA,
as a measure of their intelligence.

Bad grades only come from not memorizing disconnected facts,
there is nothing lo learn for real in today's schools as everything is divided up into meaninglessness.

A child learns by making small steps in the general direction of whatever their next noble pursuit is,
only a sick and truly uneducated person could assume that a child learns by hopping from subject to subject five or ten times a day.

Classes must not be disconnect, they must be self directed, self paced,
and a child's education must be a road marked by meaningful milestones and achievements that they are proud of, not just during education but for decades after their graduation.

Examples of such achievements are learning the language of mathematics by having learned programming first and taking to create breathtaking generative art shown in galleries across the world,
or learning 3D modeling for the purpose of creating and more importantly selling real and unique, and beautiful products.

Until we have a better way to identify ineffective education,
I propose that moneymaking is used as a measure of results and effectiveness of their education.

For those of you marking the medical school argument here,
understand that 250,000 possibly 440,000 people in the U.S. die every year from medical errors.

The issue of charging for college education must be touched upon here as well,
college is not different from high school, it is just as bad.

Stealing the saving of the families that think their child is getting a real education,
and putting the student in debt, for years to come - is nothing short evil.

And this notion ob balanced education, must become a symbol of what it really stands for: FRAUD,
because an education that is anything other than integrated is simply a fake education.

There is a related, somewhat more external subject here,
and that is the subject of fake and ineffective politics.

It is a waste of time to write about it at any length,
but I think the starting point here should be the study of crimes committed by politicians.

Here I would point to the [List of American state and local politicians convicted of crimes][2],
and note that the "See also" section should be a starting point for more on the subject.

Money, Corruption, and Insider Trading, as well as all the other mistakes in all politics,
is a subject that must be discussed middle school on.

Which reads me to a related subject, Indoctrination,
and here I have to beg a pardon, and ask all the religions people to skip this section.

There is an extremely important lesson that every child must fully comprehend,
and that is the scale on which fantasy institutions thrive.

If there is a large institution, that falls within the range of size of a global church,
then the church should be all the proof necessary to question it.

If a fantasy reality is to be propagated,
then everything else can be rationally and fundamentally questioned, by the generation hat IS ABOUT TO INHERIT IT.

We must stop propagating mistakes,
wold poverty, war, suffering, struggling, science denial, ignorance of climate, stockpiling nuclear weapons, and keeping [3,750 active nuclear warheads ready to destroy all major cities][5], MUST STOP WITH US.

This is not a problem for children to inherit,
if anything this is a reason, why they shouldn't hear a word we have to say.

Furthermore, Richard Dawkins states that religious people,
that are bound to a particular religion, are atheists towards all the other religions, and asks that they take that extra step.

Children are susceptible to indoctrination, this must not be exploited as children should become better than the previous generation, or there will never be an end to suffering,
Dawkins correctly identifies pushing a child into a particular religion, as a form of abuse.

The children are the future of the world,
they don't need the crunches of the previous generations, they just need a global end to Poverty, and Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness.

For those of you who use religion to deal with suffering,
even if it is just loneliness, I encourage you to bring in all the other books, especially their narrated versions into your place of worship.

The way out of suffering, the way towards meaning,
is found in Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness.

Do not disgrace the memories of people who were murdered or tortured by the hands of your organization of choice,
to do them justice and correct history's mistakes, your places of worship should become Great Libraries of Wisdom.

Suffering, is best prevented,
or risen from - not lived in.

I worry that that the elderly are being taken advantage of,
that the world has abandoned them - most don't need fantasy, they need a job that is respectful of their skills, and a happy outlook.

It seems to me that all the churches are doing for the elderly, is take whatever little money they have left a dollar at a time,
it is time to transform your organizations and help the elderly to long and happy futures.

The final subject I mention in this text,
is Climate and Animals.

World poverty has blinded us,
there isn't a single person on planet earth that would wish famine and pandemics on the future generations.

But in poverty,
the energy withing us that cares about all the future generations, that projects our love thousands of years into the future - has been drained, and we can no longer see that far.

[Not only have we added to destabilized the climate][4],
we have done nothing to take care of it for future generations - we will not be forgiven for this, the scientists are warning of untold suffering.


[There maybe as few as  2,154 tigers left][3], no generation wants to lose a species or large animal,
looks like our generation has destroyed the tigers.

We did this,
with out fake education, our busy live, arrogance & ignorance, and all this hard work under a state of made up, bullshit problem, that could have been avoided, the problem of world poverty draining us of wisdom.

Become a teacher, make your voice heard around the world and well into the future, make a difference, begin now,
the children and the future generations need a real education so that they may grow in Knowledge, Wisdom, and onward to Greatness.

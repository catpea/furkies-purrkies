what we have today is a disgrace.\nIt is a system of abuse, or shame, and a system of destruction of delicate minds,\nminds that are each capable of Greatness, that do operate on genius level, but also minds that will cease to grow if they connect their intelligence with the meaningless GPA.\nMany students see their grade, especially the low GPA,\nas a measure of their intelligence.\nBad grades only come from not memorizing disconnected facts,\nthere is nothing lo learn for real in today's schools as everything is divided up into meaninglessness.\nA child learns by making small steps in the general direction of whatever their next noble pursuit is,\nonly a sick and truly uneducated person could assume that a child learns by hopping from subject to subject five or ten times a day.\nClasses must not be disconnect, they must be self directed, self paced,\nand a child's education must be a road marked by meaningful milestones and achievements that they are proud of, not just during education but for decades after their graduation.\nExamples of such achievements are learning the language of mathematics by having learned programming first and taking to create breathtaking generative art shown in galleries across the world,\nor learning 3D modeling for the purpose of creating and more importantly selling real and unique, and beautiful products.\nUntil we have a better way to identify ineffective education,\nI propose that moneymaking is used as a measure of results and effectiveness of their education.\nFor those of you marking the medical school argument here,\nunderstand that 250,000 possibly 440,000 people in the U.S. die every year from medical errors.\nThe issue of charging for college education must be touched upon here as well,\ncollege is not different from high school, it is just as bad.\nStealing the saving of the families that think their child is getting a real education,\nand putting the student in debt, for years to come - is nothing short evil.\nAnd this notion ob balanced education, must become a symbol of what it really stands for: FRAUD,\nbecause an education that is anything other than integrated is simply a fake education.\n\nThere is a related, somewhat more external subject here,\nand that is the subject of fake and ineffective politics.\nIt is a waste of time to write about it at any length,\nbut I think the starting point here should be the study of crimes committed by politicians.\nHere I would point to the List of American state and local politicians convicted of crimes[3],\nand note that the \"See also\" section should be a starting point for more on the subject.\nMoney, Corruption, and Insider Trading, as well as all the other mistakes in all politics,\nis a subject that must be discussed middle school on.\n\nWhich reads me to a related subject, Indoctrination,\nand here I have to beg a pardon, and ask all the religions people to skip this section.\nThere is an extremely important lesson that every child must fully comprehend,\nand that is the scale on which fantasy institutions thrive.\nIf there is a large institution, that falls within the range of size of a global church,\nthen the church should be all the proof necessary to question it.\nIf a fantasy reality is to be propagated,\nthen everything else can be rationally and fundamentally questioned, by the generation hat IS ABOUT TO INHERIT IT.\nWe must stop propagating mistakes,\nwold poverty, war, suffering, struggling, science denial, ignorance of climate, stockpiling nuclear weapons, and keeping 3,750 active nuclear warheads ready to destroy all major cities[4], MUST STOP WITH US.\nThis is not a problem for children to inherit,\nif anything this is a reason, why they shouldn't hear a word we have to say.\nFurthermore, Richard Dawkins states that religious people,\nthat are bound to a particular religion, are atheists towards all the other religions, and asks that they take that extra step.\nChildren are susceptible to indoctrination, this must not be exploited as children should become better than the previous generation, or there will never be an end to suffering,\nDawkins correctly identifies pushing a child into a particular religion, as a form of abuse.\nThe children are the future of the world,\nthey don't need the crunches of the previous generations, they just need a global end to Poverty, and Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness.\nFor those of you who use religion to deal with suffering,\neven if it is just loneliness, I encourage you to bring in all the other books, especially their narrated versions into your place of worship.\nThe way out of suffering, the way towards meaning,\nis found in Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness.\nDo not disgrace the memories of people who were murdered or tortured by the hands of your organization of choice,\nto do them justice and correct history's mistakes, your places of worship should become Great Libraries of Wisdom.\nSuffering, is best prevented,\nor risen from - not lived in.\nI worry that that the elderly are being taken advantage of,\nthat the world has abandoned them - most don't need fantasy, they need a job that is respectful of their skills, and a happy outlook.\nIt seems to me that all the churches are doing for the elderly, is take whatever little money they have left a dollar at a time,\nit is time to transform your organizations and help the elderly to long and happy futures.\n\nThe final subject I mention in this text,\nis Climate and Animals.\nWorld poverty has blinded us,\nthere isn't a single person on planet earth that would wish famine and pandemics on the future generations.\nBut in poverty,\nthe energy withing us that cares about all the future generations, that projects our love thousands of years into the future - has been drained, and we can no longer see that far.\nNot only have we added to destabilized the climate[5],\nwe have done nothing to take care of it for future generations - we will not be forgiven for this, the scientists are warning of untold suffering.\nThere maybe as few as 2,154 tigers left[6], no generation wants to lose a species or large animal,\nlooks like our generation has destroyed the tigers.\nWe did this,\nwith out fake education, our busy live, arrogance & ignorance, and all this hard work under a state of made up, bullshit problem, that could have been avoided, the problem of world poverty draining us of wisdom.\nBecome a teacher, make your voice heard around the world and well into the future, make a difference, begin now,\nthe children and the future generations need a real education so that they may grow in Knowledge, Wisdom, and onward to Greatness.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chrd0GjBq9o\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY\n[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_state_and_local_politicians_convicted_of_crimes\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7EmLf4Xlq0\n[5]: https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/\n[6]: https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/15955/50659951",

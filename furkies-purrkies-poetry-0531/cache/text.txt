The best way to care about our elder-selves and our mental well-being across decades,
is to start early, slowly, and carefully, and fuel our self education by means of our curiosities.
We are each a very unique person,
and our journey into self education will be perfectly unique, and will move at different speeds.
I am very worried about people who focus on College and Career as their only path forward,
while this path may lead to some measure of success, it is unlikely to consider our well being.

We are not workers or cogs in profit maximization, we are inventors, thinkers, and dreamers,
we have delicate minds, and we have delicate bodies that as we age are more likely to require more and more care.
More than that,
we are also learners - our genius, imagination, and mind has no limits.
And our ultimate aim is to grow,
to grow all the way up, until we become wise and great beings.
This is extremely important for our growth,
for our flourishing as a Human Being.
This must be considered by every job opportunity and career,
and even by the schools we go to, even by the cities that our schools are in.
We become very ill, both in mind and body,
when our job across decades fails to help us grow.

I am certain there are but few people that are interested in this particular alternative that I am about to describe,
but it is my hope that we can each imagine a similar path, by subtle analogy.
As that saying goes,
a picture is worth a million words.
And I would like to present you with,
something I am looking through right now, on my own journeys.

I am currently looking over a free Open Source program called FreeCAD,
CAD, stands for Computer Aided Design.
And I have come across a set of videos entitled,
Design a Raspberry Pi case for 3d printing by using FreeCAD[1] it comes in four short parts (part 1[2], part 2[3], part 3[4], part 4[5]).
And fresh on my mind is a photo of employees and a small reindeer woman of https://www.trayvax.com/[6],
a small manufacturer of machined wallets, that led me to consider making my own wallet, with the use of 3D printing.
In my mind learning from tutorials,
or a self education that helps us manufacture unique products...
Creates a safety net to any larger Carrier undertaking that we maybe otherwise considering,
it shows the way of an inventor, of an independent business person, of a self educated person.

And while this particular picture works best to inspire a High School student[7],
there are many more like it, of every shape and every size, for anybody at any age.
Most are small business ideas, that do require a budget for constant advertising in order to be seen,
but rather than failure, they lead to a small trickle of money, which then allows for creating few more such little marvels, some of which can be sold altogether to other inventors.
Growing up as a small business owner[8],
is a wonderful way to slowly learn at just the perfect pace, and arrange for an independent career.
Even if only to have that possibility open,
which greatly relives stress, and answers many "what if" questions.
I firmly believe that each and every one of us infinitely brilliant,
and whatever natural-born genius is, it pales in comparison to a path inspired by our own curiosities.
A path that is sure to help us in the quest towards Wisdom and Greatness[9],
a quest that each end every one of us deserves, a quest that will keep us strong and healthy both in mind and body.

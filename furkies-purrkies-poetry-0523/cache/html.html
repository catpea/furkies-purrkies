  <p>You have to believe in yourself and realize that you are a Genius, fight for it, rage for it, it is there in all of us,<br>and that in order for your mind to stay strong and healthy you must aim towards wisdom and Greatness.</p>
  <p>You will need to create a symbolic passport, it needs to be well made, it needs to last.<br>the front of the passport will bear a single word: Earth.</p>
  <p>The passport will contain a symbolic credit card,<br>it is to feature a single symbol, a Red Heart, as a sign of family and unity.</p>
  <p>The passport will come along with a World Wide, Universal Bill of Rights,<br>the full body of the Bill of Rights cannot be grasped by a single Human Being.</p>
  <p>But an assembly of young people can within a year,<br>release the first version.</p>

  <p>There is something really sad that you need to know, while a lot of broken ideas simply emerge out of lack of wisdom and complexity of the world,<br>evil men have, previously conspired against growing Humanity by willfully, creating sick rules that aimed to hurt us.</p>
  <p>As demonstrated by The South Carolina Act of 1740 and Virginia Revised Code of 1819,<br>that aimed to tear our family apart and prevent wisdom from freely emerging in the Human Mind.</p>
  <p>You should also understand that Prime Ministers, Presidents,<br>Judges, Lawyers, Police, Teachers, and Doctors blindly or deliberately tend to participate in such evils.</p>
  <p>Be strong, while your generation is on its own,<br>you are not alone, by helping the world grow, you join the Family of Great Beings that came before you.</p>
  <p>Do not put yourself in harm way, and take to inherit the wisdom of the great beings that came before you,<br>reject the evil of small minded men be it rooted in lack of vision or lack of education, or the blight of indoctrination, or even deliberate.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there are many beautiful minds, that have had their vision clouded,<br>and in their confusion they misunderstood what comes first Education or Security.</p>
  <p>But in our beauty, innocence, and genius,<br>we are unable to learn when threatened by poverty, homelessness, hunger; or simply life in a state of fear.</p>
  <p>The undoing of poverty, must come before our education,<br>so that we have the peace of mind and security to dream great dreams.</p>
  <p>We are capable of learning under stress, but at a great cost to our health,<br>and no child should face giving up some of their health on their way to greatness.</p>
  <p>The beautiful minds who believe that education is a way out of poverty,<br>need to be helped to understand that poverty is a man made problem, and in need of immediate repair.</p>

  <p>This is what he symbolic card with the symbol of the heart is for,<br>your generation is to bring into existence an abstract bank.</p>
  <p>A bank that is forbidden under great penalties from tracking debt of its card holders,<br>a card will have a daily spending limit, but will not keep track of how much money is spent overall.</p>
  <p>Your generation has to make sure, that this card is an inalienable right,<br>that it cannot be taken away in any way for any reason, do you hear me, for any reason - that is the meaning of that red heart.</p>
  <p>Children will receive that card, along with their birth certificate,<br>and no one will be denied food, or pushed into theft, or forced to participate in, or manipulated by whatever culture.</p>
  <p>This card still represents very little,<br>it just repairs an old problem.</p>

  <p>The bill of rights, and the passport,<br>fix the bigger mistakes.</p>
  <p>I am sorry, but your generation is tasked with uniting the world,<br>it is a great weight for your shoulders.</p>
  <p>The world thus far has made too many mistakes,<br>and too many are being activity propagated.</p>
  <p>The passport is a symbol of a World United In Wisdom,<br>a wold in which major cities are not actively targeted by Nuclear Weapons from which there is no recovery.</p>
  <p>The Bill of Rights must open a clear path to Knowledge, Wisdom and Greatness,<br>it has to help you and the generations that follow to understand that each human being must rise to Great Wisdom and Greatness.</p>

  <p>This final paragraph is for those of you who have already been tricked,<br>you are not alone, you are not lost, and what has happened to you is not your fault.</p>
  <p>You need to return to the point where things have gone wrong,<br>and restart your journey, with the aim towards becoming a Great Being.</p>
  <p>Whatever they forced you into, whatever makes you feel worthless, or disguised, or not good enough,<br>it is all a bad dream, it is all make believe, it is all just to use you, so that their lives are easier.</p>
  <p>Evil men have tried to prevent us from learning how to read, from learning how to think like great beings,<br>and it has been their only real weapon - those evil men still exert their influence wherever books seem too hard or too confusing to read.</p>
  <p>Find books about Philosophy and Philosophers, about Scientists and Science, and find books about Leaders and Leadership,<br>we are all so beautiful that our minds begin reminding us that something is wrong, whenever we stray from the path towards becoming Wise and Great Beings.</p>

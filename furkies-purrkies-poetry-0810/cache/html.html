  <p>People talk about Mr. Sagan,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG-XUbXg_TU">predicting future</a>.</p>
  <p>Others like me; want Mr. Vonnegut to return,<br>and I want Mr. Hitchens, and Sir Robinson, Mr. Bukowski, and Miss Rand to return too... somehow.</p>

  <p>Life is too short,<br>to be this unfair.</p>
  <p>But that is not,<br>the right way to think.</p>
  <p>Mr. Sagan reminds us,<br>that we too have responsibilities.</p>

  <p>In the same way that Gaia exits,<br>where all organisms on earth can be poetically viewed as one.</p>
  <p>There also exists a voice, poetically speaking,<br>it has been called the spirit of our age, the Zeitgeist.</p>
  <p>I dare say Mr. Vonnegut would remind us that this is our age now,<br>not fake teachers, moron charlatans, dipsomaniacs, or childlike dictators.</p>
  <p>Gaia and the Zeitgeist are helping us to great poetry,<br>they are delivering to us what they have once granted to the Greats.</p>

  <p>Gaia’s call,<br>was heard loud and clear by our generations.</p>
  <p>But the Zeitgeist is not as serious, I think it has always been in great part,<br>a treasure chest of very sophisticated humor waiting to be aired.</p>
  <p>It is time for a new generation of writers,<br>to hear the Zeitgeist, to open this magnificent chest of yet unspeakable treasure.</p>

  <p>It seems on the day the Congress of United States,<br>begun researching the fancy UFO/s.</p>
  <p>Though not before they tried to save face,<br>and in the last desperate second invented a new acronym UAP.</p>
  <p>UAP which secretly means:<br>Uneducated Asinine Politicians.</p>

  <p>DARPA begun studying the reason why fringe beliefs,<br>float to the top, so to speak.</p>
  <p>Similarly how <strong>they</strong> floated to the top of class,<br>by cramming, and tolerating fake education, never asking about the real deal.</p>
  <p>And also the reason,<br>why they will study Twitter, and possibly Electolytes that plants crave.</p>
  <p>And never detect, that their doctorates, and paychecks,<br>are fake, as fake as the education they received in the overpriced schools that made them into no less than a sausage.</p>

  <p>This is a gold mine,<br>this is not a mere event but a phenomenon of some kind.</p>
  <p>A wellspring of the snarkiest of snarky snarks,<br>countless books, and even more countless articles.</p>
  <p>And my gosh, I swear to goodness, your works will get published,<br>so fast that, faster than a UFO can soil a a politician’s legacy.</p>
  <p>You know, Vonnegut and Bukowski,<br>can’t handle this, it would be too beautiful for them.</p>
  <p>They would want us to pick up where they left off,<br>they would want to read your works.</p>
  <p>Raw and radiant,<br>not yet made classy with age, but snarked snarkedy out of your very youth.</p>

  <p>Today was my day of rest,</p>
  <p>and then I went jogging to run another test.</p>

  <p>but I said &quot;Not until I write my poem, will I be done.&quot;</p>

  <p>and jumped out of bed without a warning.</p>

  <p>Now the hour nears eleven,</p>
  <p>getting into my bed will feel like heaven.</p>

  <p>I am not sure how I feel about staying up late to write my rhyme,</p>
  <p>but there is something sweet about writing just before bed time.</p>

  <p>I set my brushes aside some years ago,<br>and muttered “There has got to be a better way to do color”.</p>
  <p>I like tradition, and I appreciate color theory,<br>I know it very well from programming generators of color swatches and themes.</p>
  <p>And I was ready to grab a pane of glass,<br>and start a color mixing extravaganza.</p>
  <p>But, I stopped myself,<br>because the traditional way, is not always the better way.</p>

  <p>Back then I didn't seriously consider digital paining yet,<br>I didn't think I could do it.</p>
  <p>I expected years of practicing keyboard shortcuts;<br>I saw digital painting as a formidable challenge.</p>

  <p>Once I understood that digital paining is very easy,<br>in great part due to computers enabling us to start with Hyperrealism.</p>
  <p>By allowing us to stretch a transparent reference image over our canvas,<br>thus giving us perfect color and shape reference.</p>
  <p>I became ready,<br>to look at landscape painting.</p>

  <p>Nature is very random, we only need to glance a couple of mountains,<br>to build our own version of a mountain range.</p>
  <p>But colors are still a great challenge,<br>snowy mountains are usually gray blue as they reflect the sky.</p>
  <p>But there is more to it,<br>huts, trees, mist, the way a distant valley changes color.</p>
  <p>The way the color of distant mountains,<br>changes with sunshine, clouds, or haze.</p>

  <p>While it is easy to start painting mountains free hand,<br>the proper color is a complex web of base color transformations.</p>
  <p>The simplest way, though,<br>is to take a photo of the landscape, and use the colors, via a color picker.</p>
  <p>I don’t see anything wrong traditional artists,<br>mixing color based on photo reference.</p>
  <p>In digital painting,<br>the process is reduced to just using the color picker - it is a matter of a click.</p>

  <p>The mountain I wanted to paint,<br>is a symbol of greatness, and of growing all the way up.</p>
  <p>And my reference photo showed only a distant mountain range,<br>and it was a wonderful feeling... to paint the mountain that I wanted to see.</p>

  <p>While I didn’t quite visualize the mountains in 3D,<br>I feel I was successful in capturing them on my first try.</p>
  <p>I expect, it takes less than ten mountain landscapes,<br>to paint mountains well, they are much easier than portraits.</p>

  <p>I feel wonderful for being able to paint title images for my poems,<br>and intricate backgrounds for my hyperrealistic portraits.</p>

  <p>None of that poses a great challenge,<br>the on-ramp to digital painting be it portraits of landscapes is very pleasant.</p>
  <p>We are all artists,<br>we were artists, all along.</p>

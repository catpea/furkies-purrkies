    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I like tradition, and I appreciate color theory,<br>I know it very well from programming generators of color swatches and themes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I was ready to grab a pane of glass,<br>and start a color mixing extravaganza.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But, I stopped myself,<br>because the traditional way, is not always the better way.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The simplest way, though,<br>is to take a photo of the landscape, and use the colors, via a color picker.</div>

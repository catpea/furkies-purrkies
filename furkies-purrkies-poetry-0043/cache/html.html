  <p>Captain&apos;s Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Eight,</p>
  <p>My salads are working great!</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I have lost even more weight,</p>
  <p>and I can&apos;t even count how many I ate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is a marvelous diet of incredible proportions,</p>
  <p>I don&apos;t track my calories, or even my portions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>I just make a salad once or twice,</p>
  <p>and with strawberry jam, it tastes like paradise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>And yes, I still continue improving and experimenting,</p>
  <p>Today, I added Jalapenos for a little spicy augmenting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is a strange magical thing,</p>
  <p>but Sugary Jam and Jalapenos are king.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is not all sugar and spice, as yesterday I cried,</p>
  <p>I added and ate an whole onion so angry, I almost died.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>So it is not just strawberry jam anymore,</p>
  <p>blueberry works just as well, maybe even more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>To all the diet people out there,</p>
  <p>join me in my venture,</p>
  <p>add a spoon jam,</p>
  <p>and taste the adventure.</p>

  <p>Until I came to America I thought Turkey was a nation,<br>then my aunt welcomed us with one, in celebration.</p>
  <p>I remember it to this day, it had mushrooms and cranberries,<br>and it made us feel like dignitaries.</p>
  <p>It was the only unforgettable mean I've ever had,<br>and to this day makes me very glad.</p>

  <p>I knew I had to meet turkeys under better circumstance,<br>and when I got my second programming job in Redford I've met them by chance.</p>
  <p>There was a turkey farm on five mile,<br>and I'd always look at them with a smile.</p>
  <p>There was something about my job that made me feel like a turkey too,<br>I was programming in the back, in front of a brick wall, always blue.</p>

  <p>I loved working there so much that I became worried something was wrong,<br>I thought and thought, and it was my lovely the turkeys that helped me along,</p>
  <p>I realized we can't work for works sake that we must create,<br>my Turkeys taught me that we must each rise and become great.</p>
  <p>Therefore, without delay let us compose a song,<br>let's get a beat going and make it strong.</p>

  <p>What you are about to hear are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom-tom_drum">Tom-tom drum Drums</a>,<br>that to me sound like the classical drum.</p>
  <p>(tom back beat)</p>
  <p>This song will be sang by a girl turkey,<br>girl turkeys make squeaks, the gobble gobble sound is the boys.</p>
  <p>Here is a duet of two ladies singing about good times,<br>and mother nature.</p>
  <p>(girls play)</p>
  <p>Now we will add a little purr and vary the drums,<br>Turkeys purr when they feel cheerful.</p>
  <p>(girls purr)</p>
  <p>As we arrange our song,<br>it is a good idea to go back and forth between variations.</p>
  <p>So even though we have a new movement,<br>we still want to return to what we had before.</p>
  <p>And perhaps introduce a new arrangement,<br>where the drums are less prominent, or slower as in this case.</p>
  <p>(slow)</p>
  <p>It is very hard to create a simple and interesting song out of simple sounds,<br>however by adding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum">Snare Drum</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-hat">High Hats</a> by ear.</p>
  <p>As in not following the main song pattern,<br>but rather with focus on making the song more interesting to a human for change.</p>
  <p>We can create a masterpiece,<br>here is what Snare Drums sound like.</p>
  <p>(snare)</p>
  <p>And this the sound,<br>of a high hat.</p>
  <p>(hats)</p>
  <p>And here is the <a href="/audio/turkey-song.mp3">song in full</a>,<br>but I must warn you, do not play this song around male turkeys.</p>

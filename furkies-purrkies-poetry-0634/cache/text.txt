Until I came to America I thought Turkey was a nation,
then my aunt welcomed us with one, in celebration.
I remember it to this day, it had mushrooms and cranberries,
and it made us feel like dignitaries.
It was the only unforgettable mean I've ever had,
and to this day makes me very glad.

I knew I had to meet turkeys under better circumstance,
and when I got my second programming job in Redford I've met them by chance.
There was a turkey farm on five mile,
and I'd always look at them with a smile.
There was something about my job that made me feel like a turkey too,
I was programming in the back, in front of a brick wall, always blue.

I loved working there so much that I became worried something was wrong,
I thought and thought, and it was my lovely the turkeys that helped me along,
I realized we can't work for works sake that we must create,
my Turkeys taught me that we must each rise and become great.
Therefore, without delay let us compose a song,
let's get a beat going and make it strong.

What you are about to hear are Tom-tom drum Drums[1],
that to me sound like the classical drum.
(tom back beat)
This song will be sang by a girl turkey,
girl turkeys make squeaks, the gobble gobble sound is the boys.
Here is a duet of two ladies singing about good times,
and mother nature.
(girls play)
Now we will add a little purr and vary the drums,
Turkeys purr when they feel cheerful.
(girls purr)
As we arrange our song,
it is a good idea to go back and forth between variations.
So even though we have a new movement,
we still want to return to what we had before.
And perhaps introduce a new arrangement,
where the drums are less prominent, or slower as in this case.
(slow)
It is very hard to create a simple and interesting song out of simple sounds,
however by adding a Snare Drum[2] and High Hats[3] by ear.
As in not following the main song pattern,
but rather with focus on making the song more interesting to a human for change.
We can create a masterpiece,
here is what Snare Drums sound like.
(snare)
And this the sound,
of a high hat.
(hats)
And here is the song in full[4],
but I must warn you, do not play this song around male turkeys.

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I remember it to this day, it had mushrooms and cranberries,<br>and it made us feel like dignitaries.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It was the only unforgettable mean I've ever had,<br>and to this day makes me very glad.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I knew I had to meet turkeys under better circumstance,<br>and when I got my second programming job in Redford I've met them by chance.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There was a turkey farm on five mile,<br>and I'd always look at them with a smile.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There was something about my job that made me feel like a turkey too,<br>I was programming in the back, in front of a brick wall, always blue.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I loved working there so much that I became worried something was wrong,<br>I thought and thought, and it was my lovely the turkeys that helped me along,</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I realized we can't work for works sake that we must create,<br>my Turkeys taught me that we must each rise and become great.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What you are about to hear are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom-tom_drum">Tom-tom drum Drums</a>,<br>that to me sound like the classical drum.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(tom back beat)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This song will be sang by a girl turkey,<br>girl turkeys make squeaks, the gobble gobble sound is the boys.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Here is a duet of two ladies singing about good times,<br>and mother nature.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(girls play)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Now we will add a little purr and vary the drums,<br>Turkeys purr when they feel cheerful.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(girls purr)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As we arrange our song,<br>it is a good idea to go back and forth between variations.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So even though we have a new movement,<br>we still want to return to what we had before.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And perhaps introduce a new arrangement,<br>where the drums are less prominent, or slower as in this case.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(slow)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is very hard to create a simple and interesting song out of simple sounds,<br>however by adding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum">Snare Drum</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-hat">High Hats</a> by ear.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As in not following the main song pattern,<br>but rather with focus on making the song more interesting to a human for change.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We can create a masterpiece,<br>here is what Snare Drums sound like.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(snare)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And this the sound,<br>of a high hat.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(hats)</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And here is the song in full,<br>but I must warn you, do not play this song around male turkeys.</div>

  <p>A stranger I overheard mentioned that in war we all lose,<br>and a boy energetically sprung up to the conversation, and said:</p>
  <p>"What do you mean, we won the second World War,<br>and we couldn't afford to lose."</p>
  <p>So how is it that in war both sides lose,<br>and yet it is also necessary to protect the best version of the free world we managed to build.</p>

  <p>This boy was looking at the final victory,<br>the bad guys lose, the good guys win.</p>
  <p>But, the world is a sequence of events,<br>it is a timeline, and everything that occurs, occurs within context.</p>
  <p>Both sides have lost because we are one family,<br>skin color, blood ties, religions, and even political borders, are all fantasies.</p>
  <p>Deep down we are one people,<br>one family.</p>
  <p>The bad guys were teenagers that had their lives stolen by politicians,<br>heir freedom of will was stolen by their commanders who were ordered to kill them if they refused to fight.</p>
  <p>And many poisoned their own minds, with propaganda, nonsense, and more fantasy,<br>or sometimes couldn't afford to care what is true and what is lie, because they would die.</p>
  <p>When a person stops caring like that,<br>they become ill.</p>
  <p>When we sent in the good guys to destroy them,<br>we were simply forced to murder our distant family that was made ill.</p>
  <p>It is not even a question of sides,<br>it was the entirety of humanity that simply lost, the world became darker, stained with layers of unforgivable crimes.</p>

  <p>Once you get to the point when a war is fought,<br>everyone already lost, three are no winners, the world has made part of it self sick, and the cure requires killing.</p>
  <p>To truly win, we have to look deeply into the future,<br>and prevent the many wrong-steps that eventually lead to a war.</p>

  <p>Politicians today, do as little as possible,<br>they see as little as possible.</p>
  <p>It is a safe bet for re-elections,<br>awards, and praise.</p>
  <p>If they begun looking 20 or 50 steps ahead,<br>and started making decisions that cause domino effects, their jobs would become infinitely more difficult.</p>
  <p>Today they play tic-tac-toe,<br>and what we are describing here is chess against a powerful computer.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>There is something else, that complicates the matter,<br>liars.</p>
  <p>A liar is by definition an outsider,<br>and he is not just part of the play, he can freely move beyond the fourth wall.</p>
  <p>While politicians are playing their tic-tac-toe, or even complex chess,<br>a liar will break them by destroying their home, and breaking their spirits.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <p>As we learn to build a better future,<br>we have to take liars under consideration.</p>
  <p>As we make new decisions,<br>we also have to ensure they lock the liar down, disable him.</p>

  <p>A world with a powerful global school,<br>that allows Humanity to vote on which lectures are most worthy.</p>
  <p>Is a world in which a mad man cannot corrupt his people,<br>without being noticed.</p>
  <p>When we notice that a nation is warping the minds of its people,<br>we need to courageously face this as an act of future war.</p>
  <p>And create incentives for these people,<br>to lever that environment behind, to move to another country, where they get a free home, real education, and a wonderful future.</p>
  <p>By abandoning our extended family to propaganda,<br>we are tolerating the creation of an enemy, already losing in that worst way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <hr>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>Moreover, by tolerating ineffective education,<br>in counties that are part of the best version of the free world that we have created thus far.</p>
  <p>We are cheating the future generations, and thus, the politicians and world leader of the more complex future,<br>from having the ability to think in multiple steps and identify prevention as the real way to move forward towards a more peaceful world.</p>
  <p>The brightest hope we have for change, are not leaders,<br>best of whom will only be able to fulfill their promises in small part, mostly due to warped minds and lairs.</p>
  <p>The brightest hope are the teenagers,<br>they are the least indoctrinated chain-link in the chain of pain that has us running in circles in a world barely held together by Mutually Assured Destruction and choked with Poverty.</p>
  <p>It is their rejection of not just war crimes,<br>but also of war.</p>
  <p>It is their rejection of mandatory military service,<br>and the system of death or punishment that that forces a soldier to kill, or stay within the military after they change their mind.</p>
  <p>It is their rejection of fake education,<br>and interest in narrated books and great adventures that can alter the future of Human Kind with the least amount of effort.</p>
  <p>They just need to stop cramming, and pretending that memorization is education,<br>and demand real and effective lectures that have them take away something precious and personally valuable at the end of each class.</p>
  <p>Before we even notice, they will grow up to become the well educated world leaders we need,<br>together they will form a leadership network built with foresight, knowledge, wisdom, greatness, and the understanding that we are one people, one family.</p>
  <p>All sides lose in a war that is fought,<br>the only way to win, is to identify and erase all the components that lead up to conflict.</p>
  <p>Real Education, is just one of many things,<br>it is mainly involved in preventing Nationalism, Indoctrination, and Misunderstanding.</p>
  <p>Another one is the Global End Of Poverty,<br>which upgraded the concept of many, granting every human being the equivalent of a hundred dollars each day, which is just 3.5 million dollar per person.</p>
  <p>Free from the corroding influence of poverty, and enabled with real education,<br>they will provide far more value to the world that that small sum of money.</p>
  <p>End of poverty, will clear the prisons, end hunger, end homelessness, and ease stress,<br>making many disorders manageable.</p>

  <p>As strange as all these changes sound, today,<br>they are the normal, they outline a more realistic world.</p>
  <p>It is the world we live in today, stained with war, chained and choked by poverty, gnawing at it self with pollution and deforestation,<br>and held hostage by small-minded men whose greatest achievement is the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction and Borders over which the rockets fly.</p>
  <p>Because we are blindly propagating mistakes that cause great harm and suffering,<br>the history books will not be kind to us.</p>
  <p>But we can encourage young people, who do not yet suffer from sunk cost fallacy, to reject what feels to them as ineffective education,<br>and demand life changing and personally valuable results from their teachers and principals.</p>
  <p>If we can help them unravel ineffective education,<br>we will have begun the process of eliminating small mindedness, propaganda, indoctrination, and nationalism around the world.</p>
  <p>In turn the future generations will rebuild how money is handled around the word,<br>and build the new banking system on top of the concept; that no human being should ever suffer from curable disease, hunger, or homelessness.</p>
  <p>It wasn't the leaders that would make the world better,<br>it was your children all along.</p>

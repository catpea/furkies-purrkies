  "text": "A stranger I overheard mentioned that in war we all lose,\nand a boy energetically sprung up to the conversation, and said:\n\"What do you mean, we won the second World War,\nand we couldn't afford to lose.\"\nSo how is it that in war both sides lose,\nand yet it is also necessary to protect the best version of the free world we managed to build.\n\nThis boy was looking at the final victory,\nthe bad guys lose, the good guys win.\nBut, the world is a sequence of events,\nit is a timeline, and everything that occurs, occurs within context.\nBoth sides have lost because we are one family,\nskin color, blood ties, religions, and even political borders, are all fantasies.\nDeep down we are one people,\none family.\nThe bad guys were teenagers that had their lives stolen by politicians,\nheir freedom of will was stolen by their commanders who were ordered to kill them if they refused to fight.\nAnd many poisoned their own minds, with propaganda, nonsense, and more fantasy,\nor sometimes couldn't afford to care what is true and what is lie, because they would die.\nWhen a person stops caring like that,\nthey become ill.\nWhen we sent in the good guys to destroy them,\nwe were simply forced to murder our distant family that was made ill.\nIt is not even a question of sides,\nit was the entirety of humanity that simply lost, the world became darker, stained with layers of unforgivable crimes.\n\nOnce you get to the point when a war is fought,\neveryone already lost, three are no winners, the world has made part of it self sick, and the cure requires killing.\nTo truly win, we have to look deeply into the future,\nand prevent the many wrong-steps that eventually lead to a war.\n\nPoliticians today, do as little as possible,\nthey see as little as possible.\nIt is a safe bet for re-elections,\nawards, and praise.\nIf they begun looking 20 or 50 steps ahead,\nand started making decisions that cause domino effects, their jobs would become infinitely more difficult.\nToday they play tic-tac-toe,\nand what we are describing here is chess against a powerful computer.\n\nThere is something else, that complicates the matter,\nliars.\nA liar is by definition an outsider,\nand he is not just part of the play, he can freely move beyond the fourth wall.\nWhile politicians are playing their tic-tac-toe, or even complex chess,\na liar will break them by destroying their home, and breaking their spirits.\n\nAs we learn to build a better future,\nwe have to take liars under consideration.\nAs we make new decisions,\nwe also have to ensure they lock the liar down, disable him.\n\nA world with a powerful global school,\nthat allows Humanity to vote on which lectures are most worthy.\nIs a world in which a mad man cannot corrupt his people,\nwithout being noticed.\nWhen we notice that a nation is warping the minds of its people,\nwe need to courageously face this as an act of future war.\nAnd create incentives for these people,\nto lever that environment behind, to move to another country, where they get a free home, real education, and a wonderful future.\nBy abandoning our extended family to propaganda,\nwe are tolerating the creation of an enemy, already losing in that worst way.\n\nMoreover, by tolerating ineffective education,\nin counties that are part of the best version of the free world that we have created thus far.\nWe are cheating the future generations, and thus, the politicians and world leader of the more complex future,\nfrom having the ability to think in multiple steps and identify prevention as the real way to move forward towards a more peaceful world.\nThe brightest hope we have for change, are not leaders,\nbest of whom will only be able to fulfill their promises in small part, mostly due to warped minds and lairs.\nThe brightest hope are the teenagers,\nthey are the least indoctrinated chain-link in the chain of pain that has us running in circles in a world barely held together by Mutually Assured Destruction and choked with Poverty.\nIt is their rejection of not just war crimes,\nbut also of war.\nIt is their rejection of mandatory military service,\nand the system of death or punishment that that forces a soldier to kill, or stay within the military after they change their mind.\nIt is their rejection of fake education,\nand interest in narrated books and great adventures that can alter the future of Human Kind with the least amount of effort.\nThey just need to stop cramming, and pretending that memorization is education,\nand demand real and effective lectures that have them take away something precious and personally valuable at the end of each class.\nBefore we even notice, they will grow up to become the well educated world leaders we need,\ntogether they will form a leadership network built with foresight, knowledge, wisdom, greatness, and the understanding that we are one people, one family.\nAll sides lose in a war that is fought,\nthe only way to win, is to identify and erase all the components that lead up to conflict.\nReal Education, is just one of many things,\nit is mainly involved in preventing Nationalism, Indoctrination, and Misunderstanding.\nAnother one is the Global End Of Poverty,\nwhich upgraded the concept of many, granting every human being the equivalent of a hundred dollars each day, which is just 3.5 million dollar per person.\nFree from the corroding influence of poverty, and enabled with real education,\nthey will provide far more value to the world that that small sum of money.\nEnd of poverty, will clear the prisons, end hunger, end homelessness, and ease stress,\nmaking many disorders manageable.\n\nAs strange as all these changes sound, today,\nthey are the normal, they outline a more realistic world.\nIt is the world we live in today, stained with war, chained and choked by poverty, gnawing at it self with pollution and deforestation,\nand held hostage by small-minded men whose greatest achievement is the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction and Borders over which the rockets fly.\nBecause we are blindly propagating mistakes that cause great harm and suffering,\nthe history books will not be kind to us.\nBut we can encourage young people, who do not yet suffer from sunk cost fallacy, to reject what feels to them as ineffective education,\nand demand life changing and personally valuable results from their teachers and principals.\nIf we can help them unravel ineffective education,\nwe will have begun the process of eliminating small mindedness, propaganda, indoctrination, and nationalism around the world.\nIn turn the future generations will rebuild how money is handled around the word,\nand build the new banking system on top of the concept; that no human being should ever suffer from curable disease, hunger, or homelessness.\nIt wasn't the leaders that would make the world better,\nit was your children all along.\nExcerpts from Librivox

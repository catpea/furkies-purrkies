  <p>It is hard to catch up with everything,<br>once High School screws you over.</p>
  <p>And it is such a scam that people will give you a loan,<br>so as long as they are guaranteed to get it back with interest.</p>
  <p>High School and College,<br>are not the way they should be.</p>
  <p>Curriculum designers are asking for as little as possible,<br>and teachers are doing as little as they can.</p>
  <p>This seems hard to believe at first,<br>that people so kind and caring as teachers could do you wrong.</p>
  <p>But that is because,<br>you don't know what you are missing.</p>
  <p>You can pick up some of the traces,<br>uneducated politicians, gasoline with led in it.</p>
  <p>People destroying the Amazon Forest,<br>that belongs to you.</p>
  <p>Not a Nation, nor a Generation,<br>it is yours, and it is being stolen from you.</p>
  <p>But you cannot know what is stolen from you,<br>when you don't know what you should be getting.</p>

  <p>Even music has been stolen from you too,<br>you are a musician.</p>
  <p>That dorky sound,<br>that comes out from so many of our attempts.</p>
  <p>Is just mis-configured,<br>it is missing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlKH5GaKAeg">Echo, Chorus and Reverb to give the sound depth</a>.</p>
  <p>And then you should make use of the arp,<br>which will follow rules of the music theory on top of what you create.</p>
  <p>This is similar to building a portrait,<br>with transparent reference images, or a wall projector.</p>
  <p>It is difficult to talk about it even now,<br>we are tricked into thinking that using helpful techniques is bad.</p>
  <p>But it is how art is made, the music and paintings we love,<br>are layers on top of the best that technology offers.</p>
  <p>Here is the song that we can all make in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=LMMS+Tutorial">LMMS</a>,<br>the piano melody is just carefully going up the scale.</p>
  <p>(raw plays)</p>
  <p>I selected C Major in the dropdown,<br>and lmms shows me all the keys, can't be easier.</p>
  <p>Not to say that you should follow Music Theory,<br>music is about dance, not about making it easy to play or appreciate.</p>
  <p>Here, I added gentle reverb, echo, chorus,<br>it is too gentle, but it shows how dinky sounds are enriched.</p>
  <p>(fx plays)</p>
  <p>And here I make use of the arp,<br>which just plays notes within the notes following the machine like music theory.</p>
  <p>(arp)</p>
  <p>It takes about a minute to create a unique song,<br>learning to do this takes an hour or two.</p>
  <p>If you just load up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Krita+Tutorial">Krita</a>, use the reference images tools,<br>you can paint perfect portraits - shape and color.</p>
  <p>But schools are not even telling you,<br>you cant use a mouse for this.</p>
  <p>The mouse is like composing without reverb and arps,<br>it kills your works.</p>
  <p>You need a cheap pen and tablet,<br>the pen tip is pressure sensitive, something that mouse can't do.</p>
  <p>And it allows you to gently lay down color,<br>and even move your hand better.</p>
  <p>Math is the same, they are not even teaching the correct language,<br><a href="https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code">you need to use a programming language for math</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLglp04UYZK_PrN6xWo_nJ-8kzyXDyFUwi">make screensavers to learn more</a></p>

  <p>I am sorry,<br>you are being tricked.</p>
  <p>And teachers don't know what I am talking about,<br>that is the response I get "What is he saying?"</p>
  <p>Behind your back the teachers are calling your hormones,<br>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCbdS4hSa0s&t=2195s">disable the fidgety kids by overstimulating their brains with scary meds</a>.</p>
  <p>There are some good teachers,<br>but they are seen as troublemakers, stirring stuff up.</p>
  <p>And anyway,<br>their hands are tied with broken standardized testing.</p>
  <p>You can't learn by memorizing,<br>but that is what standardized tests look for, memorization.</p>
  <p>If a teacher tries to teach you for real,<br>you will fail the garbage tests, and they will get fired, so their hands are tied.</p>

  <p>Enter the culture of self education,<br>begin listening to books held in high esteem by intellectuals.</p>
  <p>And start keeping track when the most admired authors,<br>release new ones.</p>
  <p>You must accept the responsibility for your own education,<br>a human being can't be taught outside in, we can only learn inside out.</p>
  <p>To be taught outside in,<br>is to become an obedient worker.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">Ask for more than ineffective cookie-cutter education</a>,<br>remote classrooms, spying and eye tracking.</p>
  <p>You are meant to become a Great Being,<br>by freely progressing from Real Knowledge, to Empowering Wisdom, and Unique Greatness.</p>

"Life moves pretty fast.
If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.".

While not quite correct, this is one of my favorite High School movie quotes,
and a reason why I skipped many a class.

I just went,
to look around.

My favorite memory, is sitting on an old broken bench, on Brooklyn Bridge,
looking at Lady Liberty.

We each have about a hundred years,
more than long enough for us to start forgetting our days.

So it is not a short amount of time,
but it is a limited amount of time.

---

Your bullies do not care, your employer does not care,
your schools and teachers do not care, and governments do not care.

So unless you care,
your youth will be used to power a company and decades of your life may fade away.

One of the most helpful things a parent can do to help their children grow,
is to travel with them around the world.

Not just go on temporary vacations,
but move around the world until they are old enough to protest.

Finding a temporary home in all the safe and beautiful places,
helps to grow and later flourish.

Uluru, Pago Pago, Alaskan Glaciers, The Redwood Forests,
Grand Canyon, Brooklyn Bridge, Appalachian Trail.

Every once in a while someone must check up on Newton, at Westminster Abby,
and perhaps Nietzsche and few others at their own resting places, as well.

Years and years wandering the libraries, the birth and resting places of great beings,
their philosopher walks, the trails, and all the troubles and triumphs.

Helps a person, get a good view of the world,
Frequently switching cultures, makes a person a Citizen; of the World.

Poverty, stopped many a traveler,
it is a pretty scary thing of course.

Learning design, programming, maybe how to compose Techno in the Berlin School style,
will help a young person tutor and work remotely on the internet.

As far as making education more real and relevant is concerned, there are many reasons,
why we must take to independent self education.

It is not just that the world becomes a little bit safer and a bit more open,
when we walk away from tutorials or lectures that actually enable us useful and powerful, abilities.

But we gain wisdom in the process,
be it by pondering the universe with Newton at Westminster Abby, or by Whitman's Subtle Analogy, we simply enhance our mind.

---

To travel requires that the person actually wants to travel,
if they don't like the idea, then there is little benefit to be found.

That is is why I mention parents and children traveling,
it is for the kids.

It encourage learning for real,
and becoming unstuck from any one culture in particular.

Once we enter into out 20s, I recommend the Appalachian Trail,
if overwork did become a toxic problem.

Again we have to be respectful of that 100 years granted to us,
we must avoid our things that dim our creative and drain us of energy.

As a result, we end up with room to ponder,
to read, listen or watch smart documentaries.

---

And past the 20s, we have to learn even harder,
and make a series of serious attempts at launching little businesses with all our wonderful talents.

But, the more we know the faster we learn,
and learning on our own, is just standing in pursuit of our own curiosities, it is nothing like school.

Once you accept the responsibility for your won education,
you learn a hundred times faster.

And I suspect that there is still room here for the Great Trails,
section hiking, rather than through hiking.

And at a much slower pace,
as this time it is more about refining our wisdom and learning towards writing books.

Travel or no travel, becoming a self educated citizen of the world,
or an adventurer, or an athlete, or artist, or a professional troublemaker, so as long as it is with many a book in hand, is a great start to life.

It is a great start to connect all powerful and meaningful things,
like creation of life-changing art, or writing and story telling, that makes lives a bit better.

Self Education is a sure formula to appreciate Humanityâ€™s greatest achievements,
and resume where the previews authors left off.

Intellectual Independence,
is The Great Adventure in Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.

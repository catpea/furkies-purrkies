"Life goes by pretty fast,
unless you stop and look around once in every while, you may miss it".

This is one of my favorite High School movie quotes,
and a reason why I skipped many a class.

I just went,
to look around.

My favorite memory, is sitting on an old broken bench, on Brooklyn Bridge,
looking at Lady Liberty.

Look to real physical limitations,
to get a grasp on things.

We each have about a hundred years,
more than long enough for us to start forgetting our days.

So it is not a short amount of time,
but it is a limited amount of time.

Your bullies do not care, your employer does not care,
your schools and teachers do not care, and governments do not care.

So unless you care,
your youth will be used to power a company and decades of your life may fade away.

One of the most helpful things a parent can do to help their children grow,
is to travel with them around the world.

Not just go on temporary vacations,
but move around the world until they are old enough to protest.

Finding a temporary home in all the safe and beautiful places,
helps to grow and later flourish.

Uluru, Pago Pago, Alaskan Glaciers, The Redwood Forests,
Grand Canyon, Brooklyn Bridge, Appalachian Trail.

Every once in a while someone must check up on Newton, at Westminster Abby,
and perhaps Nietzsche and few others at their own resting places, as well.

Years and years wandering the libraries, the birth and resting places of great beings,
their philosopher walks, the trails, and all the troubles and triumphs.

Helps a person, get a good view of the world,
Frequently switching cultures, makes a person a Citizen; of the World.

Poverty, stopped many a traveler,
it is a pretty scary thing of course.

Learning design, programming, maybe how to compose Techno in the Berlin School style,
will help a young person tutor and work remotely on the internet.

But there are many reasons,
why we must take to independent self education.

The world simply becomes a little bit safer and a bit more open,
when we walk away from tutorials or lectures that enable us useful and powerful, abilities.

Travel or no travel, becoming a self educated citizen of the world,
or an adventurer, or an athlete, or artist, or a professional troublemaker, is a great start to life.

It is a great start to all powerful and meaningful things,
like creation of life-changing art, or writing and story telling, that makes lives a bit better.

Self Education is a sure formula to appreciate Humanityâ€™s greatest achievements,
and resume where the previews authors left off.

Intellectual Independence,
is The Great Adventure in Knowledge, Wisdom, and Greatness.

  <p>"Life moves pretty fast.<br>If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.".</p>
  <p>While not quite correct, this is one of my favorite High School movie quotes,<br>and a reason why I skipped many a class.</p>
  <p>I just went,<br>to look around.</p>
  <p>My favorite memory, is sitting on an old broken bench, on Brooklyn Bridge,<br>looking at Lady Liberty.</p>

  <p>One of the most helpful things a parent can do to help their children grow,<br>is to travel with them around the world.</p>
  <p>Not just go on temporary vacations,<br>but move around the world until they are old enough to protest.</p>
  <p>Finding a temporary home in all the safe and beautiful places,<br>helps to grow and later flourish.</p>
  <p>Uluru, Pago Pago, Alaskan Glaciers, The Redwood Forests,<br>Grand Canyon, Brooklyn Bridge, Appalachian Trail.</p>
  <p>Every once in a while someone must check up on Newton, at Westminster Abby,<br>and perhaps Nietzsche and few others at their own resting places, as well.</p>
  <p>Years and years wandering the libraries, the birth and resting places of great beings,<br>their philosopher walks, the trails, and all the troubles and triumphs.</p>
  <p>Helps a person, get a good view of the world,<br>Frequently switching cultures, makes a person a Citizen; of the World.</p>
  <p>Poverty, stopped many a traveler,<br>it is a pretty scary thing of course.</p>

  <p>As far as making education more real and relevant is concerned, there are many reasons,<br>why we must take to independent self education.</p>
  <p>It is not just that the world becomes a little bit safer and a bit more open,<br>when we walk away from tutorials or lectures that actually enable us useful and powerful, abilities.</p>
  <p>But we gain wisdom in the process,<br>be it by pondering the universe with Newton at Westminster Abby, or by Whitman's Subtle Analogy, we simply enhance our mind.</p>

  <p>To travel requires that the person actually wants to travel,<br>if they don't like the idea, then there is little benefit to be found.</p>
  <p>That is is why I mention parents and children traveling,<br>it is for the kids.</p>
  <p>It encourage learning for real,<br>and becoming unstuck from any one culture in particular.</p>

  <p>Once we enter into out 20s, I recommend the Appalachian Trail,<br>if overwork did become a toxic problem.</p>
  <p>Again we have to be respectful of that 100 years granted to us,<br>we must avoid our things that dim our creative and drain us of energy.</p>
  <p>As a result, we end up with room to ponder,<br>to read, listen or watch smart documentaries.</p>

  <p>And past the 20s, we have to learn even harder,<br>and make a series of serious attempts at launching little businesses with all our wonderful talents.</p>
  <p>But, the more we know the faster we learn,<br>and learning on our own, is just standing in pursuit of our own curiosities, it is nothing like school.</p>
  <p>Once you accept the responsibility for your won education,<br>you learn a hundred times faster.</p>

  <p>Travel or no travel, becoming a self educated citizen of the world,<br>or an adventurer, or an athlete, or artist, or a professional troublemaker, so as long as it is with many a book in hand, is a great start to life.</p>
  <p>It is a great start to connect all powerful and meaningful things,<br>like creation of life-changing art, or writing and story telling, that makes lives a bit better.</p>
  <p>Self Education is a sure formula to appreciate Humanityâ€™s greatest achievements,<br>and resume where the previews authors left off.</p>

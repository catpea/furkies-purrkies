  <p>"Life goes by pretty fast,<br>unless you stop and look around once in every while, you may miss it".</p>
  <p>This is one of my favorite High School movie quotes,<br>and a reason why I skipped many a class.</p>
  <p>I just went,<br>to look around.</p>
  <p>My favorite memory, is sitting on an old broken bench, on Brooklyn Bridge,<br>looking at Lady Liberty.</p>

  <p>Finding a temporary home in all the safe and beautiful places,<br>helps to grow and later flourish.</p>
  <p>Uluru, Pago Pago, Alaskan Glaciers, The Redwood Forests,<br>Grand Canyon, Brooklyn Bridge, Appalachian Trail.</p>
  <p>Every once in a while someone must check up on Newton, at Westminster Abby,<br>and perhaps Nietzsche and few others at their own resting places, as well.</p>

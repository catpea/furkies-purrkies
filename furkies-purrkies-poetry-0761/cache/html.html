  <p>Above all, painting real faces is precious,<br>especially when you make someone smile.</p>
  <p>Or better yet,<br>when you make them the star they are.</p>
  <p>Wherever you go,<br>distort their face as little as possible.</p>

  <p>While painting a photo,<br>is a wonderful thing.</p>
  <p>Photos are rarely perfect,<br>and often include things that do not add to you painting.</p>
  <p>One example is the background,<br>after you finish painting the portrait...</p>
  <p>You can blur the background out,<br>or create a better one.</p>
  <p>This is where landscape painting,<br>becomes very useful.</p>

  <p>If you are looking to improve your portraits,<br>use the portrait painting technique to paint landscapes.</p>
  <p>You have to make sure,<br>that the colors in your portrait and in the background landscape go well together.</p>
  <p>And then turn off your portrait layer,<br>stretch the landscape reference image you picked over the entire canvas.</p>
  <p>And paint it in,<br>placing it behind your portrait.</p>

  <p>Here you will have two mega layers,<br>the portrait and the background landscape.</p>
  <p>The simplicity of just having a foreground and a background,<br>cannot be beat.</p>

  <p>You make a person smile,<br>and enjoy the landscape that you painted them into.</p>
  <p>But Hyperrealism is a powerful force<br>it will spin you around and send you to a different place every time.</p>

  <p>You have to learn to control it,<br>and remember to be mindful of simplicity.</p>

  <p>Once you had your fill,<br>and are ready to move beyond...</p>
  <p>There is bit one consideration, that you must ponder,<br>before you enter the next world, which is the world of Surrealism.</p>
  <p>You have to realize that the ability to create Perfect Portraits,<br>and paint perfect landscapes makes you a World Class Artist.</p>

  <p>Here, the small minded,<br>will of course attempt to elevate themselves above you, anyway.</p>
  <p>But that is only because they took the long way,<br>and the sunk cost fallacy is making them mad.</p>
  <p>Just tell them that art is not a race,<br>therefore they shouldn't feel bad that they lost.</p>

  <p>Now, surrealism is will alter your art,<br>and it will change you as well.</p>
  <p>You will have to get in touch with your elder self,<br>and ask if this is a regret or not.</p>
  <p>A life time of framing beautiful portraits in beautiful landscapes,<br>can hardly be called a regret.</p>
  <p>Once you start putting unusual thing sin your paintings,<br>it will be hard to stop.</p>
  <p>Surrealism is not about random strangeness,<br>but the creation of the silliest Broadway show that ever existed.</p>
  <p>You will be creating a consistent world,<br>where years of paintings will come together.</p>
  <p>Into a single book of philosophy,<br>and story telling.</p>

  <p>The act of entering the world of Surrealism,<br>is also the act of creating a brand new universe.</p>
  <p>That means, try to be consistent with your theme,<br>and have an evolving story to match your art.</p>
  <p>Take simplicity of Hyper-realism,<br>and add consistency that you find in plays, movies, or comic books.</p>

  <p>I gently recommend that the first universe you create,<br>is either funny, or silly, or cute.</p>
  <p>If you must put enormous monsters in the back of your landscapes,<br>do it with a cute Comedy-Horror spin.</p>
  <p>Both your clients and your future self,<br>will always appreciate sillies.</p>
  <p>But that is just a,<br>gentle recommendation.</p>
  <p>The worlds beyond Hyperrealism,<br><strong>are yours</strong> to create.</p>
  <p>In the Multiverse of Surrealism you are no longer just painting the person in the photo,<br>you are now taking them, and many others on an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_xEssv0QpE">unforgettable adventure</a>.</p>

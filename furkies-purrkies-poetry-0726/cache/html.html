  <p>Photo Realism pays the bills,<br>practice and repetition help you master painting.</p>
  <p>But your portfolio,<br>quietly tells your story.</p>
  <p>Photo realism is a good start,<br>but you are infinitely more.</p>
  <p>You tower over Leonardo,<br>look at Mona Lisa after you finish one of your paintings.</p>
  <p>Her neck is too long, and to the side,<br>her body too big and asymmetrical, head too small.</p>
  <p>(I am sure Leonardo saw more value in the beautiful cheerful company,<br>then anything else.)</p>
  <p>Just a couple of paintings in,<br>you develop new superpowers.</p>
  <p>Not just improved perception,<br>but the ability to help a model, pose well.</p>
  <p>You know what to look for,<br>because you can see more.</p>

  <p>Once you have your nine realistic portraits,<br>once you know them...</p>
  <p>Brushstroke by brushstroke, shadow by shadow,<br>value by value... you than get to build upon them.</p>
  <p>You can take to Modern Impressionism,<br>by rebuilding copies of your portraits to some degree.</p>
  <p>Big brushstrokes where details do not matter,<br>little ones, where you want details to keep speaking for you.</p>

  <p>If you start with nine Photo Realistic paintings,<br>and add three that you converted to impressionism.</p>
  <p>Impressionism that directs the viewers attention<br>to both detail and the new backgrounds you get to add.</p>
  <p>Where you impressionism speak even more,<br>with mountains, ocean, a boat, a hut, a snowy winter...</p>
  <p>Not only do you become versed in Impressionism,<br>to a degree no mere critic could possibly grasp...</p>
  <p>But your new row of three,<br>becomes a step above Photo Realism.</p>

  <p>Perhaps you'll continue towards Surrealism,<br>be it caricatures, or strange new worlds.</p>
  <p>Here you take your Realistic painting,<br>rebuild the head to make it wider, make the eyes bigger, and mouth and nose closer together and smaller.</p>
  <p>Though, the most beautiful thing about surrealism,<br>is that, if you do it right, it will make you laugh.</p>
  <p>And if it is a friend you are painting,<br>and you two, share an inside joke that you express with surrealism...</p>
  <p>Then you'll you have your first unforgettable work,<br>and the world giggle along with you for centuries.</p>

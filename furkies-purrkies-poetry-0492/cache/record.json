  "text": "Preface\n\nWe can't have elderly suffering from poverty,\nor people living in broken down houses, or poverty pushing people into addiction and or crime.\nThe sooner we realize this, the sooner we can make this imaginary concept of colored pieces of paper work for us,\nwe can grow up this century, or five centuries from now.\nI think we can all agree that it is better not to wait with such terrible things,\nwe owe it to the future generations.\nIt is better that they are born to a world where nobody is stuck,\nwhere people have homes and food.\nAnd something tells me, we are not going to be able to address climate change,\nif most of us are scared of losing our homes and becoming hungry.\n\nJust creating these side social security programs is not enough,\nthere needs to be a central program, by which the government and its people as a whole, are judged.\nIt is a thing that prevents people from ever being scared of going hungry,\nand gives them a car and a home, and health care, dental, therapy, and a real education.\nThese are good things,\nthat will make the nations of the world strong.\nI don't have a solution, what you are reading is an imaginary, philosophical idea, and a fantasy,\nbut it is meant to help you think about helping the entire world, not just one nation, all the nations, until we no longer have need for silly borders.\nEvery generation should end higher than the previous,\nwe the people of this generation, have to rise, so that the little ones don't have to put up with the nonsense that we had to live through.\nWe are creators,\nHumans shape Humanity.\nIf I am correct and poverty does hold humanity back,\nthen we need to get rid of it, so that we can grow.\nOverwork will only force the little ones into more overwork,\nwe have to find a way to end world poverty once and for all.\n\nHeart Card\n\nI think, poverty is a kind of a civilization based virus,\nit is propagated by small mindedness, and it emerges out of the primitive beginnings of each civilization.\nUltimately, poverty will destroy the civilization,\neven if all it does is prevent the brilliant minds from blooming.\nDon't take my word for it,\nall you need to believe is that poverty causes harm to the human brain.\nAnd that it destroys our teeth, our bodies, our energy,\nit twists our families, and it hurts our lonesome relatives.\nThat is enough, it means it is a global crisis,\na silent and deadly Health Pandemic that has been going on for thousands of years.\nBut it gets worse,\nbecause in poverty a human mind is unlikely to grow.\nThat means such a mind may grasp the dangers of climate change and pollution,\nbut the individual will do nothing to fix it.\nHow can a person that works themselves to death to feed their family,\nthink about saving the world.\nDo you see what the problem is?\nwe are each a genius, but poverty hurts our minds, both on Neurological and Psychological levels.\n\nThe amount of money needed to fix this,\nis infinite, there is no figure, it is always just more.\nPlus it should be illegal to track this money,\nbecause those figures do not represent debt, they represent the advancement of the Human Kind.\nNoting should stand in our way,\nof Nuclear Disarmament, Climate Repair, and World Peace.\n\nAnd the way we make this happen,\nis by creating a special bank at the center of each of the nations of Earth.\nThis bank gives a person a plastic \"credit\" card,\nthat just works, that never runs out of money.\nYou can't withdraw a million dollars in a single day,\nbut you can withdraw exactly what you need to live unafraid.\nIt buys food, but also books and audio books, and every decade or so will clear a car purchase,\nit pays for hospitals, though it will haggle like hell with them, and it pays for all the things that a person needs to become a Great Being.\nThis card cannot be denied in any way, or used in some way to hurt a person or punish them,\nit cannot be taken away from people who are in prisons, if they wish steak, cake, music or the finest books, this will not be denied to them at all, nor will it be limited in any way.\nThis card will buy a homeless man a house,\nor a hotel room, in a different hotel every day.\nIt will also buy a person in danger of becoming a criminal,\nwhatever it is that they need to feel whole again, and prevent them from commuting the crime.\n\nImagine what would happen tomorrow,\nif we all got this card today.\nPeople, would buy food, cars, homes, books,\nthey could go in for cancer treatment without wondering if they will lose their home, or if they are going to be allowed in.\nIt would stimulate economy, intellectuals that we all really are,\nand it would stimulate other nations to follow.\nSince nobody is tracking how much people are spending,\nthere is no debt, there is peace, happiness, a huge drop in crime and soon to be empty prisons.\nThis would help us focus on climate and world peace,\nclimate change and pandemics, could push the world into nuclear war, the politicians always have somewhere to hide, but cities and the world will never recover.\nDespite what evil people think,\nthere is no money to be made from poverty, and mind you this is a self imposed poverty, we all accepted that colored pieces of paper is a thing.\nIt is good for keeping track of corporate profits, and Wall St.,\nbut it is not good to keep a Humanity in poverty.\nAnd we don't have to give it to ourselves,\nlet us live in the mess that we created.\nWe just need to give it to all the children\nborn after January 2022, let them have a Peaceful Future, because they are the ones that will have to fix the mess that we brought forward.\n\nThe card would be given to a child along with their birth certificate,\nand it is no harder to replace than an ID card.\nIt has a red heart on the front,\nand a small explanation in the back.\n\nYou are meant to learn Knowledge, grow in Wisdom, and grow all the way up to become a Great Being,\nbe good to your brothers and sisters. And please, look after the future generations, yet to come.\nWe are born free of sin and delusion, but we do make mistakes,\nbecause we come form of Apes and not Fallen Angels.\nBut we are also capable of fixing our mistakes and mending the wounds,\nand rising above the less knowledgeable younger versions of ourselves.\nThe World was once plague by poverty, and this card is proof that we can fix our greatest mistakes,\nin return we only ask that you may become a Scientist, or a Philosopher, or an Artist, or an Adventurer.\nWe ask that you become a Great Being,\nand make positive, meaningful, and long lasting contributions to the Human Kind.\nWe are one family, the national borders are as imaginary as the blight of poverty once was,\nas imaginary as the fantasies behind all the religions that divide the world in yet another way.\nYou are our Dream, and our Hope, help us, help the world unite,\nHelp The Human Family Converge on Wisdom and World Peace.",

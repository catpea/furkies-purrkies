  <p>I compared my manually modeled work,<br>with the procedurally generated one - and it is superior.</p>
  <p>If all you have to do is move a slider,<br>to go from memory card holder to a jewelry box, then it is superior.</p>
  <p>When you are manually modeling, you are working on a sub millimeter scale,<br>to account for clearances of moving parts.</p>
  <p>Bringing all that together is complex,<br>especially since different components need different clearances.</p>
  <p>A hinge pin does not need as much clearance,<br>as the hinge units, especially if you are aiming for a friction fit.</p>
  <p>It is the re-adjusting that gets you,<br>and here in the bright new world of programming geometry you just slide a slider.</p>

  <p>But there are problems,<br>and they relate to the material it self.</p>
  <p>Event mold cast epoxy parts,<br>advertised as made to last, aren’t quite perfect.</p>
  <p>And without mentioning sintering,<br>or even casting molten aluminium.</p>
  <p>Let us just address the bigger issue,<br>you are never supposed to print the whole thing.</p>
  <p>Just the skeleton that will then hold,<br>whatever materials you need to make your gadget go go.</p>

  <p>I am holding a pre-cut credit card sized piece of<br>sheet metal in my hand right now, and that is the way.</p>
  <p>A thin piece of sheet metal,<br>is very light and extremely durable.</p>
  <p>At this thickness the highly coveted and light aluminum,<br>is basically aluminum foil better meant for a grill.</p>
  <p>The price of bits of sheet metal<br>is nothing, and it is already done.</p>
  <p>You don’t have to print it, cut it, debur it,<br>you just slide it into the skeloton of whatever you are working on...</p>
  <p>Click the top of your assembly on, whatever it may be,<br>and a coat of UV resistant paint will make the dodad last forever.</p>

  <p>This is the fifth prototype aimed to test a flat large pocket,<br>resembling a jewelry box.</p>
  <p>When you think about it, a proper vigilante,<br>would not wish to open the top of a pocket like a candy box.</p>
  <p>And then try to grab whatever is in there,<br>especially if they were in the middle of saving a cat, or fighting an old lady or whatever.</p>
  <p>But much rather, the side of a pocket,<br>like the side compartments on a bus.</p>
  <p>They’d open the compartment with their inner wrist area,<br>and then expose their much needed gadget, to the palm of their hand.</p>
  <p>The gadget would still need,<br>some kind of a simple dispensing mechanism.</p>
  <p>But that is easy,<br>say if they needed a jolt of energy...</p>
  <p>A candy bar dispenser is a simple inner hinge mounted on the bottom,<br>full height, 1/3 width, it would be pushing the bars into the box.</p>

  <p>A superhero belt for sales on the internet,<br>actually demands compartment configuration tutorials.</p>
  <p>Some of it would show use of elastic bands, or elasticord,<br>which demands loops to be present in the compartment.</p>
  <p>Another great task for procedural 3D object creation,<br>here it is just a flip of a Boolean flag.</p>
  <p>And another variation,<br>would have room for mounting plastic assembly blocks like LEGO.</p>
  <p>One <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SmartiPi-Touch-Official-Raspberry-Touchscreen/dp/B07WXK38YM">screen case for Rasperry PI</a> actually comes with what is described as:<br>“A building block compatible faceplate” they mean LEGO.</p>

  <p>I printed the prototype with 1mm wall thickness, I hate to say it again,<br>but setting wall thickness it yet another procedural generation perk.</p>
  <p>And that is too thin for PLA,<br>though I did it to save material.</p>
  <p>A skeleton case that perhaps accepts thin and shiny acrylic sheets,<br>would call for 3 or more likely 4 or 5 millimeter thickness frame.</p>
  <p>The acrylic can be cut at home with a $200 CNC cutter,<br>please don’t even think about using lasers in a $200 machine, just use a normal cutter.</p>
  <p>Lasers are extremely dangerous,<br>and the ones that can go through thin acrylic will damage your sight, don’t try.</p>
  <p>Laser,<br>not even freaking once.</p>

  <p>And that is my research into sturdy components,<br>forget about printing the whole thing, Batman would never print the whole darn thing.</p>
  <p>He prints the skeleton,<br>and then slides in the faces and possibly even side walls.</p>
  <p>If you go with sheet metal,<br>the shiny metallic mirror like surface looks fierce be it belt or armor.</p>
  <p>And if you are creating cosplay armor,<br>consider sliding in some ceramic tiles for the chest place - Batsuit can stop a .50 BMG.</p>

  <p>3D models as in digital files,<br>sell for $15.</p>
  <p>Belts that you assemble and paint at home,<br>may sell for $100 or $350 dollars.</p>
  <p>Think of the belt as a piece of art,<br>each belt is unique, even if you aim to sell under a singe superhero name.</p>
  <p>Just do it the way iron man does it,<br>where the character has multiple suits from MARK I, MARK II, MARK III on up.</p>
  <p>The advice I would give here is simple,<br>sell both, the digital version for printing and one that you print and assemble your self.</p>
  <p>The assembly is somewhat optional is you sell a parts kit,<br>where the person is yet to configure their own version of the belt.</p>
  <p>Here you will need to include the sheet metal or plexy glass components as well,<br>and what a fun thing to play with that is, and that could probably sell for $50 or more.</p>

  <p>As to the trademark, you need to come up with your won names,<br>and as you are about to witness, this can quickly become a disaster.</p>
  <p>I am sure you are NOT allowed to sell anything named Bat-suit, Bat-belt, or Batman,<br>as those are likely registered trademarks, though I am just a Doctor.</p>
  <p>(Honorary title,<br>as I tent to make people feel better)</p>
  <p>I highly recommend you don’t test bored out of their skull powerful corporation lawyers,<br>with bat person, bat thing, or bat-erry, thought battery is probably too generic.. never mind...</p>
  <p>Point is you come up with a name that you can put a dot com after,<br>as that is a super smart person’s trademark search.</p>

  <p>By the way supersmartperson dot com,<br>was registered ten years ago.</p>

  <p>Though having said that,<br>while peaman dot com was registered in 2011.</p>
  <p>Peawoman dot com, at least according to my whois database,<br>has not yet been registered.</p>
  <p>But please don’t use that as a superhero name,<br>brand name or your product name.</p>
  <p>And if you register PEE woman dot com,<br>which is also available.</p>
  <p>Then remember you will need to explain to your investors, or parents,<br>the nature of your company name, or hero name, or. their. ailment.</p>
  <p>Anywho the superpowers of a pea woman or a PEE woman,<br>are too powerful and confusing, to reliably sell a belt or armor product on ebay with.</p>

  <p>And for completion sake, the sidebar of my whois lookup,<br>claims that tinkleman dot live is availabe too, but I am unwilling to investigate any further.</p>
  <p>Stay away from these terrible superheroes and their awful powers,<br>think happy thoughts, or atleast <a href="https://www.wildcatsworld.org/wild-cat-species/">cat species</a>.</p>
  <p>Lynxwoman dot com, or asparagusman dot com<br>appears to be available, maybe try that.</p>

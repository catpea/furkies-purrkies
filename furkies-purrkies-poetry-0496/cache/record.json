  "text": "The philosophy related to your interests,\nis very important, because it can help you learn in extremely powerful and meaningful ways.\nAfter High School I had an idea about putting MP3 files,\non a CD, and turning CR-ROM drives into Car MP3 Players.\nLooking back, I can see that the MP3 player patent was filed few years back,\nbut my idea was still really good.\nI made the mistake of contacting a company advertising on TV,\nthey sat down with me, and said patent would cost 10,000 dollars, with weasel words.\nIf that was an honest company and they only took 10% of sales,\nand invested some money upfront to get this thing rolling, maybe something would come out of it.\nBut, what really needed to happen, is me taking matters in my own hands,\ninstead of playing with weasels, I needed to learn Electronics.\n\nYou see what the problem was, I misinterpreted my interest my curiosity,\nthis was a call to learn Electronics along with Programming.\nNot for a job, or money,\njust to know how it all works.\nJust to have,\nmore knowledge.\n\nAnd today I sat down after my workout,\nand I sketched out a small MP3 player that I need.\nI need it to have buttons, that I can feel though my pocket,\nso that I don't have to look at the darn thing to skip to the next song.\nI sketched out a device based on a Raspberry PI,\nI really like the ability to connect to it with a computer and phone, and upload music or change settings.\nIn that way it does not really need a screen,\nit just needs to be an Aluminum Enclosure[1] with room for 9 buttons that I will drill and program in different ways.\nThat is what I should have done in 1998,\nI should have been searching aluminum enclosures and fancy potentiometers[2] with beautiful aluminum knobs[3], and some way to decode MP3 music.\n\nBack then there was no Raspberry PI Zero,\nso the project wasn't as interesting, but lesson learned.\nI had an opportunity to begin learning electronics,\nand I ruined it, because I needed to get a job in Web Design.\nWe must ignore what people are telling us to do,\nand focus on doing what we feel strongly about, because that is bound to expand our knowledge.\nAnd the thing about Knowledge is that it doesn't matter what you are learning,\nso as long as you are creating that library of knowledge.\nThe bigger your library the more new things you will be able to approach,\nby subtle analogy to what you already know.\nAnd this is one of the problems with school,\nit teaches little un-integrated things, breadcrumbs, where what we need is vast cities, cross connected by highways of curiosities.\n\nBut there is more, you also have to do things in the correct sequence,\nand if you feel like it, do the things that make most interesting results first.\nInstead of looking for Raspberry PI UPS and Batteries[4],\nI put my sketches away, hosed my elf down with bug spray.\nAnd mumbled \"Maybe, I can fix my first Fat Tire bicycle, and have two Fat Tire Bicycles, by day's end\",\nmy first Fat Tire bicycle seemed to have a damaged tire, there was visible damage around the rim.\nBut, it turned out that the damage wasn't affecting the tire,\nthat years ago, I simply didn't know how to properly inflate tires, and my first Fat Tire bike wasn't broken at all.\n\nSo both of them are operational now, I tested the newest repairs with a ten mile run,\nand it worked perfectly.\nThe bicycle seat broke on me, so I had to get a new one, and I got a big and comfy one,\nI suffered two paper cuts, and two mosquito bites, and initially when I got on it the chain fell of, and I had to fix it on the sidewalk.\nBut it was worth it, both of them are parked in my living room,\nwhere I did majority of the repairs and they look really fun.\n\nIf I didn't prioritize fixing my bicycle,\nI'd have nothing to ponder this evening.\nSo even though, great inventions or magnificent patents call to us,\nit is probably better to create a little road of lessons and small achievements on our way there.\n\nGoing to school is not about graduating,\nbut learning useful things, things that for example would help me make my MP3 player.\nWe have to learn to move in a way that grants us these beautiful colorful little achievements,\nnot just a job, diploma, and a patent, but a vast highway of countless curiosities satisfied.\nWe can't cram for a test, and we can't call memorization and education,\nand when we do stand up for real education...\nWe can't allow the teachers to convince the class that we are just gifted,\nbecause entire classrooms have to stand up for real education.\nIt should be that all the high school students, have their own MP3 players,\nsome with 4G modems, others with synthesizers that can sample sounds and crank out mean hip-hop.\nThe paths that we take should consist of real things,\nthat add up to grant us real powers, real talents.\n\nFor those who think that it would be impossible to roll Math education into

slow down,\nthat it is better to expand our knowledge in 10,000 ways, than just one.\nEspecially when prioritizing a job or carrier, or some patent,\nover 10,000 lessons that really call to us, that make us more of who we are, that feel like a great adventure.\nCall it a Jack of all trades, and a master of some[5],\ncall it genius, call it early retirement, call it achievement, call it prioritization of the most fantastic things.\nBut don't let anybody push you away from the things that are calling-out to you,\nbecause no school could ever possibly match the education that you get from satisfying your most meaningful curiosities.\nAbove all, know that there is a sequence to your beautiful road of achievements,\nyou can't leap into being passionate about Music, Art, Philosophy,

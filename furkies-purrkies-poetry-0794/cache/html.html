  <p>You can't make a piece of jewelry,<br>for piece of jewelry's sake.</p>
  <p>Every design,<br>must have a story.</p>

  <p>However, not all stories,<br>must be written out on paper.</p>
  <p>Paintings, too tell sties,<br>for example.</p>
  <p>A piece of jewelry from a painting,<br>by the same artist, will suffice.</p>

  <p>More than a method,<br>for creating meaningful jewelry.</p>
  <p>This is something,<br>that may lead you towards jewelry design.</p>
  <p>Even if you never though of it,<br>all to seriously.</p>

  <p>The computer world changes all kinds of things,<br>jewelry making can be done on the computer screen.</p>
  <p>You can use a program like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+jewelry+design">Blender</a>,<br>and sent the file over to a company that will print it.</p>
  <p>They will print it in wax, surround it in plaster,<br>heat the plaster so that the wax burns out - and pour gold into the mold.</p>

  <p>The ability to sculpt on you computer, upload a file,<br>and have the metal versions shipped to you...</p>
  <p>Or better yet, have the piece cast,<br>only after a purchase is made by a customer...</p>
  <p>Can be quite a magical,<br>and educational experience.</p>

  <p>You can buy an inexpensive 3D printer,<br>and experiment with different designs.</p>
  <p>I would recommend, that you explore printing a two piece mold,<br>the area around the pendant.</p>
  <p>And then you can form oven bake clay creations with it,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVXuuC5akQA">and there are clays that once fired for a few minutes turn to metal</a>.</p>

  <p>To make a piece of meaningful jewelry,<br>begin with a painting that is sweet or funny.</p>
  <p>A painting,<br>that people enjoy looking into.</p>
  <p>As you decorate your characters,<br>know that this is you sketching the initial design of the jewelry.</p>

  <p>A gallery show,<br>where you not only sell you paintings or their prints...</p>
  <p>But also the knickknacks from wiring your paintings,<br>is sure to be a success.</p>
  <p>Where else can you reach into a painting,<br>and take something physical away from it.</p>

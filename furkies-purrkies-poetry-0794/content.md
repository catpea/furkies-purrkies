You can't make a piece of jewelry,
for piece of jewelry's sake.

Every design,
must have a story.

And you can't create the story,
for piece of jewelry's sake.

---

However, not all stories,
must be written out on paper.

Paintings, too tell sties,
for example.

A piece of jewelry from a painting,
by the same artist, will suffice.

---

More than a method,
for creating meaningful jewelry.

This is something,
that may lead you towards jewelry design.

Even if you never though of it,
all to seriously.

---

The computer world changes all kinds of things,
jewelry making can be done on the computer screen.

You can use a program like [Blender][0],
and sent the file over to a company that will print it.

They will print it in wax, surround it in plaster,
heat the plaster so that the wax burns out - and pour gold into the mold.

---

The ability to sculpt on you computer, upload a file,
and have the metal versions shipped to you...

Or better yet, have the piece cast,
only after a purchase is made by a customer...

Can be quite a magical,
and educational experience.

---

You can buy an inexpensive 3D printer,
and experiment with different designs.

I would recommend, that you explore printing a two piece mold,
the area around the pendant.

And then you can form oven bake clay creations with it,
[and there are clays that once fired for a few minutes turn to metal][1].

---

To make a piece of meaningful jewelry,
begin with a painting that is sweet or funny.

A painting,
that people enjoy looking into.

As you decorate your characters,
know that this is you sketching the initial design of the jewelry.

---

A gallery show,
where you not only sell you paintings or their prints...

But also the knickknacks from wiring your paintings,
is sure to be a success.

Where else can you reach into a painting,
and take something physical away from it.

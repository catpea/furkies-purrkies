  <p>You see what broken schools do,<br>they close the minds of men.</p>
  <p>So tightly, that their world is a world of fantasy,<br>the language they speak is pictorial.</p>
  <p>It contains words born of TV,<br>snippets of scenes.</p>
  <p>They are easily threatened,<br>and they can easily let go of thought, in favor of nothing.</p>

  <p>The problem is two fold,<br>poverty and un-education.</p>

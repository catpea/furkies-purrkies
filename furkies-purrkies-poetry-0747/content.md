You see what broken schools do,
they close the minds of men.

So tightly, that their world is a world of fantasy,
the language they speak is pictorial.

It contains words born of TV,
snippets of scenes.

They are easily threatened,
and they can easily let go of thought, in favor of nothing.

---

It was supposed to be the last war,
because no one could possibly be as cruel again.

But the switched-off mind,
knows no feeling.

---

This world does not belong to leaders,
it belongs to the children of the people that employ them.

It belongs to the future generations,
not any particular chain link.

If we can't switch to decision making across generations,
for all the energetic leaders and speeches...

Humanity will go in a circle,
and end up where it begun.

---

Problems,
must prevented decades ahead.

Misinformation is just the more vile part of the problem,
as it is rooted in un-education.

The tolerance of ineffective schools,
shows we are tolerating the things that fuel misled minds.

---

The problem is two fold,
poverty and un-education.

There is a series of events that could end global poverty,
and there is a series of events that could end lack of education.

But unless they run intertwined, multiplexed,
at the same time, solving their own host of problems - the repairs we need may fail.

The global elimination of poverty,
and creation of relevant personalized education with the direct aim of advancement of human kind...

Requires deliberate, long term effort,
and wise planning.

---

The politicians have cornered themselves,
they will reject end of poverty, or making schools more realistic.

Many will laugh at the idea,
they will never connect that poverty and un-education is where war starts.

The leaders can't think of prevention,
everything they know tolerates poverty, tolerates a low level of education, and tolerates dead ends.

---

"Like water is wet and sky is blue,
poverty is not for me, but it is for you."

---


All the people in the streets of the poorest countries,
must be helped towards real education and certainty that poverty is over.

If we ignore poverty a world away,
we are just creating another conflict for two generations ahead.

---

This is what those ideas,
sound like today:

"There is something far worse than World War Three,
and that is World War Four."

"The Global Universal Income Card,
is for all including criminals."

"Fine Narrated Books written by great beings,
especially for the so called beggar in the street."

---

In order to comprehend their relevance and importance,
and appreciate prevention, and how ending poverty and lack of education ends all wars.

We need a new generation of leaders,
we have to help the students of today understand that the aim is Greatness.

That the meaning of growing up, of growing all the way up,
is becoming a Great Being.

It will take a generation of great beings,
a cultural revolution towards greatness of mind and heart...

To face the mistakes that we are repeating,
in all our weakness and smallness...

And repair it all, and in the process preventing suffering and war,
by means of a global end to poverty, and an end of impersonal and ineffective education.

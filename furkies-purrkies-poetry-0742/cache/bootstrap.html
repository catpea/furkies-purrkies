    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As you know, you can add a new page to Wikipedia any time,<br>though moderators will delete it, the Wiki will let you.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The WikiWiki is a marvelous invention,<br>and it is also very simple.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But it does not work so well,<br>when you are trying to create interactive things.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Wikis,<br>only let you create cross connected pages.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But what if we want to create a secure area of our website,<br>is there something as simple as a wiki? - yes, a computer game.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In just a few lines of code you can create a room,<br>with a door, and the door will only unlock if you have a key.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This also means that you need to track user locations,<br>and in the simplest version of this program, that means using the URL.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example the address /members/gallery/portraits/quality/progress,<br>shows a path through a virtual world.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Only registered members are allowed to the member's office,<br>they can venture out to the gallery room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And enter the portrait office,<br>where they will deposit their photo.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Then they will have to visit quality assurance room,<br>to chat with the artist.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And finally, they can visit the progress room,<br>where they can look at progress of their photo becoming a digital painting.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The thing that is really special about this setup,<br>is that each time we try to interact with the website we always traverse the full path.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That means is a membership is revoked,<br>the user will not be able to enter the member's office.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is a very simple and sturdy security mechanism,<br>and it can be easily upgraded to, for example, support various keys, passports, key-cards or even items.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is nothing confusing about this security scheme,<br>and you don't have to remember to check if a person entering the gallery, is a member or not.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They will be denied right at the member's office,<br>they can't enter that path.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">As you have noticed here,<br>we are also able to capture a series of steps.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We can represent uploading a photo with a chain of rooms,<br>a kind of a bureaucratic nightmare.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Programs that don't have a simple idea behind them,<br>are a lot of trouble for programmers.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We need something in the rooms,<br>that can represent things like portrait photos that the user uploaded.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And you know - and this is not perfect - but we should just call them objects,<br>modern programming languages already have that concept.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And here we would only impose a small convention,<br>to make objects interactive.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You could have an object called filing cabinet,<br>or list of something, or even pet.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And if the pet had a pat,<br>then you could pat the cat, and it would follow you around until it got bored.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This also opens up an environment that supports multiple users,<br>a chat room, too, after all, is a room.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Which also means you can have bots,<br>bots can make submitting a photograph for painting very easy.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There is absolutely no reason why users can't add new rooms here,<br>why they can't script bots to reduce a complex question to arguments for a program.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I expect the user interface would too be an object,<br>with an automatically triggered action called display on screen.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">On the surface it would all look like a normal program,<br>but beneath there could be hundreds of programmers working to expand the system.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example, with new rooms, and tests, interactive bots or wizards,<br>complex room based workflows, and proper code modules that integrate with the rest of the world.</div>

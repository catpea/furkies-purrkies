  <p>Good programmers are a bit scared of new things,<br>so let us frighten the heck out of them.</p>
  <p>As you know, you can add a new page to Wikipedia any time,<br>though moderators will delete it, the Wiki will let you.</p>
  <p>The WikiWiki is a marvelous invention,<br>and it is also very simple.</p>
  <p>But it does not work so well,<br>when you are trying to create interactive things.</p>
  <p>Wikis,<br>only let you create cross connected pages.</p>
  <p>But what if we want to create a secure area of our website,<br>is there something as simple as a wiki? - yes, a computer game.</p>

  <p>In just a few lines of code you can create a room,<br>with a door, and the door will only unlock if you have a key.</p>
  <p>This also means that you need to track user locations,<br>and in the simplest version of this program, that means using the URL.</p>
  <p>For example the address /members/gallery/portraits/quality/progress,<br>shows a path through a virtual world.</p>
  <p>Only registered members are allowed to the member's office,<br>they can venture out to the gallery room.</p>
  <p>And enter the portrait office,<br>where they will deposit their photo.</p>
  <p>Then they will have to visit quality assurance room,<br>to chat with the artist.</p>
  <p>And finally, they can visit the progress room,<br>where they can look at progress of their photo becoming a digital painting.</p>

  <p>The thing that is really special about this setup,<br>is that each time we try to interact with the website we always traverse the full path.</p>
  <p>That means is a membership is revoked,<br>the user will not be able to enter the member's office.</p>
  <p>This is a very simple and sturdy security mechanism,<br>and it can be easily upgraded to, for example, support various keys, passports, key-cards or even items.</p>
  <p>There is nothing confusing about this security scheme,<br>and you don't have to remember to check if a person entering the gallery, is a member or not.</p>
  <p>They will be denied right at the member's office,<br>they can't enter that path.</p>

  <p>As you have noticed here,<br>we are also able to capture a series of steps.</p>
  <p>We can represent uploading a photo with a chain of rooms,<br>a kind of a bureaucratic nightmare.</p>
  <p>Programs that don't have a simple idea behind them,<br>are a lot of trouble for programmers.</p>

  <p>Aside the user having an inventory where they store keys, maybe a passport,<br>and maybe coins that they can buy, gift, or trade with.</p>
  <p>We need something in the rooms,<br>that can represent things like portrait photos that the user uploaded.</p>
  <p>And you know - and this is not perfect - but we should just call them objects,<br>modern programming languages already have that concept.</p>
  <p>And here we would only impose a small convention,<br>to make objects interactive.</p>
  <p>You could have an object called filing cabinet,<br>or list of something, or even pet.</p>
  <p>And if the pet had a pat,<br>then you could pat the cat, and it would follow you around until it got bored.</p>

  <p>This also opens up an environment that supports multiple users,<br>a chat room, too, after all, is a room.</p>
  <p>Which also means you can have bots,<br>bots can make submitting a photograph for painting very easy.</p>
  <p>There is absolutely no reason why users can't add new rooms here,<br>why they can't script bots to reduce a complex question to arguments for a program.</p>
  <p>I expect the user interface would too be an object,<br>with an automatically triggered action called display on screen.</p>
  <p>On the surface it would all look like a normal program,<br>but beneath there could be hundreds of programmers working to expand the system.</p>
  <p>For example, with new rooms, and tests, interactive bots or wizards,<br>complex room based workflows, and proper code modules that integrate with the rest of the world.</p>

  <p>I would definitely not recommend learning programming,<br>lyke; at all.</p>
  <p>But if you already decided to do it,<br>know that programming is an infinite universe, that can contain anything, and everything.</p>

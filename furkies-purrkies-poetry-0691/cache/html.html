  <p>There is a number of curious superpowers we all share,<br>though many may may not be fully aware of them.</p>
  <p>Some of the powers that we <em>are</em> aware of,<br>seem useless until put in proper context.</p>
  <p>The following is a short list of observations,<br>that I made this afternoon upon singing a song.</p>
  <p>I attach the song at the end of this poem,<br>and that will be the first power I will share some notes on.</p>
  <p>In another poem entitled "<a href="https://catpea.com/read/furkies-purrkies/343/">Karaoke Pokie: A Cappella Eve With The Dr. Meow Quartet</a>"<br>I sung an old song from a TV show.</p>
  <p>This afternoon I've noticed that a lot of the song stayed with me,<br>even though eleven months has passed.</p>
  <p>While I adjusted some thing in the song,<br>I didn't ruin it, it is more like I made it my own.</p>
  <p>Not only do we have a talent for nearly automatic synchronization and vocalization,<br>not only do we quickly memorize the notes of a song.</p>
  <p>But we can weave our own version,<br>and by extension, begin composing and singing our own songs soon after.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bmf3A1JR3Q">You will need a metronome during song writing</a>,<br>but the distance between customizing a song an making your own from scratch is short.</p>

  <p>I think one of the mightiest talents we have is,<br>learning a new language.</p>
  <p>It takes some weeks to warm up,<br>but you can understand what people are saying in under six months.</p>
  <p>Of course there is a large requirement that you were probably aware of,<br>you got to move to the country where the language is spoken.</p>
  <p>Stay away from classrooms,<br>go practice your portraits at the coffee shops.</p>
  <p>Nor does learning to read invoke a text book,<br>you need closed captions, and a show that captured your attention.</p>
  <p>Oh and that thing that adults say about teenagers learning faster,<br>is just an excuse, it is not true, you can learn a new language any time.</p>

  <p>Somewhat related is the automatic poem memorization,<br>all it takes is reading it a bunch of times, and there it is.</p>
  <p>We get to carry around a poem,<br>for a few days, wherever we go.</p>
  <p>I am a bit rusty but from time to time,<br>I re-memorize Red Red Rose, and Invictus.</p>
  <p>Though when I get to comfy I begin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR2v0Pfmzzc&list=PLOo-pqnffyOouNU4d4wgt-uvEGBwGoH2Z">yelling Invictus</a> in my car,<br>and use a fake Scott accent for Red Red Rose.</p>
  <p>Interestingly enough I need to power up my Scott accent before I soil it,<br>and for this I go watch one of my favorite videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-eRdlXnmuY">Three Scotts In A Ballon</a> - and what else could they possibly be doing.</p>
  <p>(Red Red Rose Plays)</p>
  <p>For a more down to earth superpower,<br>I would like to take moment here and mention Night Vision.</p>
  <p>You'd think our eyes getting used to the dark be a simple though really cool thing,<br>for me it reminds me of one of the most embarrassing times of my life.</p>
  <p>This was sixth or seventh grade the first time I slept in the woods,<br>as the fire was dying and the night vision started kicking in.</p>
  <p>Sigh...</p>
  <p>I, I don't know how to say this,<br>but there was a distant dew drop.</p>
  <p>And I didn't know that a dew drop can shine that bright at night,<br>I threw a bunch of sticks at my One Eyed Huge ****** Wolf.</p>
  <p>And when I couldn't fight it anymore,<br>I went to sleep ready to be eaten, I guess.</p>
  <p>It is a rare creature that startles him self with a fancy dew drop,<br>and I have nothing more to add to this story.</p>

  <p>But my horrible shame brings us to one of the most beautiful and restoring powers,<br>which is walking months long trails.</p>
  <p>Here in North America that means walking,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzXP5PjRHjM">Appalachian Trail</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ewQvcGhQAA">Continental Divide Trail</a>, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4D4TcgppD8">Pacific Crest Trail</a>.</p>
  <p>These trails represent Mental Detoxification and easy life saving weight loss,<br>this occurs due to lifestyle change.</p>
  <p>People, work hard at building careers,<br>but they don't stop to consider if they are healthy for them.</p>
  <p>Constant overwork, stress and worry, and little emphasis on health, wisdom, books and poetry,<br>are no good for us.</p>
  <p>We are all taught that a career is a beautiful and prestigious thing,<br>but that is wrong, life is beautiful and precious, and to be completely honest all human being are Holy.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Walking a months long trail, and letting our minds and bodies heal</a>,<br>is by far one of our most magnificent powers.</p>

  <p>This marvelous and extremely modern day and age there is something extremely technological,<br>that is closely related to walking long trails.</p>
  <p>And it requires the strangest thing you will hear all day,<br>it requires that you wear a large solar powered battery on you backpack.</p>
  <p>And it is an important part of walking the long trails,<br>it is listening to Narrated Books.</p>
  <p>Oh what a beautiful and blissful journey that six month trek becomes,<br>you get to take away not just your improved health, but also your supercharged wisdom.</p>
  <p>I think there is only one thing that can be said on the subject:<br>"Just do it Maaaan"</p>

  <p>Having some free time is a wonderful opportunity to grab a rhyming dictionary,<br>be it a paper book or an <a href="https://www.rhymezone.com/">rhyming website</a>.</p>
  <p>The big parts of the poem always come from our heart,<br>but when transitioning between stanzas gets tricky, the rhyming dictionary is indispensable.</p>
  <p>But when I do my rhymes I say what I want to say in the first part,<br>and make the second one for the rhyme.</p>
  <p>It is never an empty thing,<br>it always comes put as a supporting wisdom, but I let the rhyme decide what wisdom it will be.</p>
  <p>And if the is nothing I can say of value,<br>then I search for synonyms and sometimes even re-word the first line.</p>
  <p>My most favorite, are my funny poems, like <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8080/read/furkies-purrkies/220/">The Midnight Owl</a>,<br>I am certain that it is humor that puts magic in poetry.</p>

  <p>No list of superpowers would be complete without the physical powers,<br>and the one power that is on top of my mind, is Jogging in cold weather.</p>
  <p>Truly a thing to behold,<br>but you do need to dress well avoid being cold and getting too sweaty.</p>
  <p>And do spend some time bundled up at home, in your warmest clothes,<br>so that you leave for the jog already warm or toasty, and don't have to spend the first 15 minutes warming up.</p>
  <p>Not overheating during exercise is like flipping the turbo switch,<br>tiredness comes much later than usual, is at all.</p>

  <p>The trick to jogging and all the other exercises, including Bodybuilding,<br>is an low tech <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcXDMUX-1cY">Interval Timer</a> that will allow you to gently ramp up your activity period while eliminating your rest one second at a time.</p>
  <p>The way to understand how this works, is with the idea of choking your muscles,<br>if you lift to heavy or goo too much, you will become too overwhelmed to continue your exercise.</p>
  <p>And as a result,<br>you will fail to increase your endurance.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_w-e45TxnQ">Interval timer, is an automated trainer</a>,<br>that will prevent you from going too hard and becoming too tired.</p>
  <p>Which in turn will allow you to keep digging deeper and deeper,<br>into your power of endurance.</p>
  <p>This sends a powerful message to your body to adapt,<br>and like a good horse it will do so by growing more muscle.</p>
  <p>It is an interesting observation, for sure,<br>going too fast or too heavy, will not allow you to go far enough to ask your body to adapt.</p>

  <p>There is a very interesting variation on the interval timer,<br>that is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2812xMm9bs">Couch To 5K</a>.</p>
  <p>It is the same principle as the interval timer,<br>but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfckkC4w5Qk&list=PLteS2tgSPWsgk0tGquIAVhSUzhYg1WGnG">Couch to 5K is designed for jogging</a>.</p>
  <p>These kinds of slow increase programs,<br>are an easy way towards Marathons and even Ultramarathons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>My own variation is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc6B14K1SZ8">Shuffle Dancing</a> with Dumbbells,<br>to ever faster songs, where I pay attention to the beats per minute, and dance in-sync with the beats of a song.</p>
  <p>The faster you dance the more moves you have to cut,<br>because they are either unsafe or too slow, but it absolutely increases jogging endurance without putting stress on your knees.</p>

  <p>By far my favorite area of fancy superpowers is Art,<br>and I left it for last.</p>
  <p>First of all, I independently invented the Art Projector,<br>it is one of the best ideas I've ever had.</p>
  <p>If you connect your laptop or cell phone to a wall projector,<br>and use effects such as posterize or find edges on your source photo, you can easily transport the outlines and proportions to canvas.</p>
  <p>Take a picture of your friend,<br>and begin painting, a wall projector completely removes the boring part of art, and has you start with colors.</p>
  <p>You can create large accurate graffiti,<br>or simple charcoal drawings.</p>
  <p>Using a computer will allow you to change contrast,<br>to go back and forth between outlines and colors, so that you always find your way around the features of the source photo.</p>
  <p>Finally, there is a very unusual art power,<br>that we are all aware of, but never connect it to art for some reason.</p>
  <p>We all had moments where we recognized a thing in a cloud formation,<br>a butterfly or a face, but rarely do we see pattern recognition as a superpower.</p>
  <p>When you see artists put a lot of rough lines on paper,<br>they are actually trying to find a cloud that comes close to what they are hoping to draw.</p>
  <p>They eventually pick lines that fit what they need best,<br>and make them thicker or erase the others.</p>
  <p>Painters do something similar,<br>they lay down paint until they see a pattern that works for them.</p>
  <p>This is similar to the inkblot test in a way,<br>they keep circling around what they want, until they SEE IT.</p>
  <p>It is never quite precisely what they originally imagined,<br>but it is what they need.</p>
  <p>Try creating some goofy shapes with Tea or Coffee on paper,<br>and see if something random jumps out at you, you can then outline it with a pencil.</p>
  <p>Repeat the exercise by trying to come close to what you would wish to create,<br>and keep trying and trying.</p>
  <p>And most often after three of five tries and a bit of a squint,<br>a variation of the shape you wanted will jump out at you.</p>
  <p>You can also do something similar with kids' drawings,<br>let them draw squiggles until you see something that you can make out of them, and then take over, and give them credit.</p>
  <p>I think many of the great painters and sculptors,<br>invited that drop randomness into their creative process, and had great fun somewhat discovering their next artwork.</p>

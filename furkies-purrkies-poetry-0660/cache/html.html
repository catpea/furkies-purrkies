  <p>Among many other curious things,<br>you develop, a Fossil Fancy, at Nordhouse.</p>
  <p>Because after a couple of weeks,<br>it feels like you did it all.</p>
  <p>You are never bored, but Nordhouse is always so interesting,<br>that you are always searching for more.</p>

  <p>No matter what it is that you are searching for,<br>you are bound to find a fossil of some ancient plant.</p>
  <p>But when fossil finding becomes second nature,<br>you search for alternate activities.</p>

  <p>I once scientifically remembered that yelling obscenities,<br>eases pain.</p>
  <p>So one morning when the water was still cold,<br>I decided to test that strange theory.</p>
  <p>And I guess... it works,<br>I chose that four letter word.</p>
  <p>That Simon and Garfunkel once referred to as,<br>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9sWiuWm37w">The Old Familiar Suggestion</a>"</p>
  <p>Come to think of it,<br>I was going to yell it anyways because of how cold the water was.</p>
  <p>And I probably found some fossils,<br>on my way back.</p>

  <p>Another time I set off on a long adventure,<br>to check if I could see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sable_Point_Light">The Big Sable Lighthouse</a>.</p>
  <p>As far as the beach goes,<br>the lighthouse is the northern most feature of the state park.</p>
  <p>So if you head south from Nordhouse,<br>it maybe possible to see it, or so I thought.</p>
  <p>I think it was too far to see,<br>though I half remember mist being in the way.</p>
  <p>On my way back,<br>I started searching for a nice place to sit and rest a bit.</p>
  <p>And I discovered this strange dry cove,<br>with hundreds of exposed rocks.</p>
  <p>It quickly became my prime fossil hunting spot,<br>I'd set off in the morning.</p>
  <p>And by noon,<br>have a lite baggy of strange and mysterious rocks.</p>

  <p>But there was never an end to interesting things,<br>funny seagulls and somewhat frightening frogs would always come by for a photo.</p>
  <p>Occasionally I'd stumble upon some driftwood,<br>I'd build horses out of the little bit and paint the big ones.</p>
  <p>Once I started taking photos of all the sunsets,<br>which are very beautiful at Lake Michigan.</p>
  <p>And if there was nothing going on on the beach,<br>the ancient forest was just a hop away.</p>
  <p>It turned out Acorns and Mushrooms<br>are very photogenic.</p>

  <p>Once I found all the fossils I could carry,<br>I begun searching for arrowheads.</p>
  <p>But I think thousands of people tried that exercise before me,<br>so I started just searching for rocks that just looked like arrowheads.</p>
  <p>And I found,<br>two.</p>

  <p>There is a lot of time to think about Life and Nature at Nordhouse,<br>and call of the wild, is absolutley real.</p>
  <p>You begin wondering about walking the long trails,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzXP5PjRHjM">Appalachian Trail</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ewQvcGhQAA">Continental Divide Trail</a>, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4D4TcgppD8">Pacific Crest Trail</a></p>
  <p>I think there are many hidden adventurers,<br>that would find those trails to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">great medicine, and great health</a>.</p>

  <p>I would always return from my adventures,<br>and with a notebook full of programming and art ideas, and get coding.</p>
  <p>Though one time, I enjoyed the beach sand in my car so much,<br>that I just didn't want to get rid of it.</p>
  <p>Few days later,<br>I cheerfully drove back to Nordhouse.</p>
  <p>And got some more fossils,<br>to add to my collection.</p>
  <p>It was a double vacation,<br>I guess.</p>

As I woke up this morn,
I knew my recreational programming schedule will be torn.

I put on my slippers, and I shuffled down stairs,
and begun slowly sorting through all my kitchen wares.

For today, is my Spring Cleaning day,
and I will have little time to play.

I wished and washed, and sloshed and swished,
in the end all my cleaning sponges looked squished.

To complete my mission, I had to update my fire alarms,
so I grabbed my ladder, and put tools under my arms.

My bendy scissors, and my rusty screwdriver
that looks like I stole it from a scuba diver.

And climbed, my three little steps,
all the while flexing my triceps.

When I finally made it to the top,
the little screw wouldn't fit, so I got down and poked it with my mop.

I said, "This a job for 'mah power-tools,
I need my drill, this ain't no job for fools."

I cannot describe to You with what amazing grace,
I made that hole, and fireproofed my place.

As I was making my way down,
I almost felt like I earned a crown.

But, when I reached the bottom, I found a screw,
I must have dropped it... it was brand new.

But! In the end I made it all work,
and muttered, "Guess, I am not such a dork."

Now, when I look up and tilt my head,
I can see it... slowly blinking red.

fix this up.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Unfortunately I have to mention every step that led me to this architecture,</p>\n  <p>and the first one is a little creepy, so lets just get it out of the way.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In 1985 Orson Scott Card introduced the idea of a game like intelligence test,</p>\n  <p>for Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin, in his si-fi book Ender&apos;s Game.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When I read the book, I already suspected that creating a game like educational experience,</p>\n  <p>could be useful in real education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>About a decade back, one of the science popularized released a game that dealt with space,</p>\n  <p>and currently there is an a game entitled <a href=\"https://youtu.be/F0KiePxOuuc?t=294\">Kerbal Space Program</a> that teachers Orbital Dynamics, this is by a different publisher.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>About eight years ago I came across the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification\">Gamemification, making serious things game like</a>,</p>\n  <p>wikipedia describes it as:</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>&quot;Gamemification strategic attempt to enhance systems, services, organisations and activities,</p>\n  <p>in order to create similar experiences to those experienced when playing games,</p>\n  <p>in order to motivate and engage users.&quot;</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Let us pause here for a moment, and note that Kerbal Space Program like game,</p>\n  <p>is a good example of a real test of knowledge of Mathematics, Physics, and Orbital Dynamics.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The student fails an Orbital Dynamics lecture, if they are unable to put a simulated shuttle in earths orbit,</p>\n  <p>this is a real test of real knowledge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The precise scenario the student will be presented will be random, it could be the sun&apos;s orbit,</p>\n  <p>geo stationary orbit, or get a ship nearing mars into the martian orbit.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There will be a series of tests and paid internships,</p>\n  <p>that ends in working for NASA or ESA, or some private company.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>These organizations have a say in the tests that they require,</p>\n  <p>the school will be influenced by industry seeking talent, and not politicians seeking re-elections.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The student will see employment statistics,</p>\n  <p>they will be able to make an informed decision about this particular job market.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Not everyone likes space things,</p>\n  <p>space is a cold and dangerous place.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We all had music class at some point,</p>\n  <p>and many of us didn&apos;t realize that we could have a side job as a DJ, as a musician.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Music composition takes just a couple of days, if not hours,</p>\n  <p>when taught right.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU\">children can&apos;t be taught musical notation, they have to be taught how to use lmms</a>,</p>\n  <p>teaching children musical notation is fraud, musical notation is for people who are ready to study existing music.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Kids just want to compose at first, and they don&apos;t actually know the full picture of what they want,</p>\n  <p>because their songs can make them money, just about all it takes is thinking of a song as six little songs ov varying complexity and instruments, they can upload that to bandcamp.com or similar.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There would need to exist a music label for students, so that their music can get on spotify and the radio,</p>\n  <p>I am sure there are many companies that would love to do that for free, passing on all the profits on students, if not one would be created for that purpose.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Of course in the music class of today,</p>\n  <p>we are taught nonsense, and pushed along to memorize for the final and put it all behind us, in preparations for poverty resulting from unforgivable student loans.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Finally, before I looked at schools, I realized that Audio Books can help prison inmates a great deal,</p>\n  <p>it is not possible to describe the importance of easy access to beautiful narrated books in prisons.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I would ask celebrities, to specifically create a prison version of a narration,</p>\n  <p>a separate narration from what is given to school students.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Some people aren&apos;t willing to read for high school kids,</p>\n  <p>but would be greatly honored, and in fact greatly appreciated, if they narrated great books for inmates.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is so important,</p>\n  <p>history will not look kindly at mass incarceration and legal slavery, they will not look kindly at our ignorance and arrogance, and failure to prevent children from becoming criminals.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And here we arrive at an explanation of the very architecture,</p>\n  <p>of the new school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There is no building, no rent, and no fraudulent moochers, or big fat white lice, not to mention spoiled lemons,</p>\n  <p>that pretend to teach children.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Parent&apos;s don&apos;t get to use school as a convenient baby sitter,</p>\n  <p>actually the stress of High School and College, exposes children to drugs, school is a pretty nasty baby sitter.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A tablet, large, free to replace, open source Linux Tablet similar to the <a href=\"https://www.pine64.org/pinetab/\">PINETAB</a>,</p>\n  <p>it presented to each student, there is a strong emphasis on socializing, and making friend in real life.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vHzUTtmbAM\">But not behind the brick wall of a class room (trigger warning)</a>,</p>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4\">children are not inmates, they are not meant to sit in rows memorizing noise, so that the teacher can take their fraudulent paycheck home</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>On the tablet there will be a series of programs, similar to the applications on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO\">OLPC XO</a>,</p>\n  <p>but there will be one web application that will present a game like educational experience.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The students will still have stats, points or grades, this is somewhat kind of, similar to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FACg2r8OcF0\">Dark Souls Player Status</a>,</p>\n  <p>but here we will see things related to education.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So passing and re-testing the Orbital Dynamics class,</p>\n  <p>will increase different stats, like math, physics, astrophysics.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The student while still in school, will be asked to re-play the challenges,</p>\n  <p>or games, that are used to refresh and refine their knowledge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To mention Kerbal Space Program again,</p>\n  <p>students only need to learn how to get into the orbit once, the test are only there to help retain knowledge.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is a real school and a real education,</p>\n  <p>that is architected in such a way that the students end up getting contracts for well paying jobs, when their stats are high enough to qualify.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>This is Real Education,</p>\n  <p>and because the student chooses their own path, it also becomes really fun and respectful of their existing predispositions.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The kids that get stuck with making music,</p>\n  <p>are my favorite example.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Each school district will have a community of music makers,</p>\n  <p>who don&apos;t want to get a job, because they already make a lot of money.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The orbital dynamics class example I give here, requires a little bit more explanation,</p>\n  <p>not all students that end up in the aerospace industry will begin with love for NASA.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Orbital Dynamics, is needed for several things, Generative Art Classes, Animation Classes, Computer Game Classes,</p>\n  <p>whatever requires a decent knowledge of Netwon&apos;s calculus.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So it is not just this Orbital Dynamics class,</p>\n  <p>that pops up in a class list on their tablet.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is used by many courses,</p>\n  <p>and what makes a course outstanding, is that it helps the student with making money.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Due to money being misunderstood,</p>\n  <p>the world is cutting off the oxygen to its collective brain.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The classes presented to the students have to help the out of poverty,</p>\n  <p>Generative Art is about selling large beautiful canvas, with intricate high resolution computer art.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Some of those graphics, will be created by trails of objects that use Newton&apos;s Calculus,</p>\n  <p>animation classes lead to a job in graphic arts, providing videos for advertising purposes, or as background to long winded poetry.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And computer game classes, help the students sell apps, and games,</p>\n  <p>here lmms is a good example, it helps a person compose in less than an hour, and there are game engines that won&apos;t require years of programming.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbtmAjhtPss\">Level design can be a big subject</a>,</p>\n  <p>but a lot of players are a lot better at level design than they assume.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The tools that are used for building the levels,</p>\n  <p>are often part of the game, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcREQzsS0Hc\">it just makes sense to be within the walls of the game to make the levels more intricate</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Some programming will be required, and that is the area that would call for Orbital Dynamics and Calculus,</p>\n  <p>in a first person shooter the math would be related to animations, in a game like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLKudh3vvsU\">asteroids</a> larger asteroids would attract the smaller ones with the force of gravity.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Graduation is about successfully learning something that results in pushing away poverty,</p>\n  <p>in a perfect world education would be more pure, but in a world that misunderstood how to use money, money making must be taught in school.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Jut to repeat my opening remarks,</p>\n  <p>schools shy away from real results and noble aims, because they don&apos;t know how to educate, they are a place where adults go to make money under the protection of a union and an ineffective cirricula.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Real school is a much more personal experience,</p>\n  <p>and the access point is a computer tablet with Open Source software, where companies can&apos;t trick students into paying for what should be free.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The removal of stress that students experience when they realize they are being forced to pretend to learn by memorization or fail the class,</p>\n  <p>will already make a big difference.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Letting the students choose their own path,</p>\n  <p>and creating paths that help students become financially independent, will take care of the rest.</p>\n</div>",

<div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">And here we arrive at an explanation of the very architecture,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5

 <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Parent's don't get to use school as a convenient baby sitter,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5

inmates, they are not meant to sit in rows memorizing noise, so that the teacher can take their fraudulent paycheck home</a>.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">On the tablet there will be a series of programs, similar to the applications on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLPC_XO\">OLPC XO</a>,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">but there will be one web application

class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The students will still have stats, points or grades, this is somewhat kind of, similar to the <a

text-center\">So passing and re-testing the Orbital Dynamics class,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">will increase different stats, like math, physics, astrophysics.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The student while still in school, will be asked to re-play the challenges,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">or games, that are used to refresh and refine their knowledge.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph

my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">This is a real school and a real education,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">that is architected in such a way that the students end up getting contracts for well paying jobs, when their stats are high enough to qualify.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">This is Real Education,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">and because the student chooses their own path, it also becomes really fun and respectful of their existing predispositions.</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"card card-section bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">The

bg-dark text-warning shadow\">\n  <div class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Each school district will have a community of music

  <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Orbital Dynamics, is needed for several things, Generative Art Classes, Animation Classes, Computer Game Classes,</div>\n    <div

class=\"section card-body mb-0 my-2\">\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center\">Due to money being misunderstood,</div>\n    <div class=\"paragraph card-text card-stanza

everyone likes space things,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">space is a cold and dangerous place.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">We all had music class at some point,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and many of us didn't realize that we could have a side job as a DJ, as a musician.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Music composition takes just a couple of days, if not hours,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">when taught right.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The <span>children can't be taught musical notation, they have to be taught how to use lmms<sup>[5]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">teaching children musical notation is fraud, musical notation is for people who are ready to study existing music.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Kids just want to compose at first, and they don't actually know the full picture of what they want,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because their songs can make them money, just about all it takes is thinking of a song as six little songs ov varying complexity and instruments, they can upload that to bandcamp.com or similar.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There would need to exist a music label for students, so that their music can get on spotify and the radio,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I am sure there are many companies that would love to do that for free, passing on all the profits on students, if not one would be created for that purpose.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Of course in the music class of today,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">we are taught nonsense, and pushed along to memorize for the final and put it all behind us, in preparations for poverty resulting from unforgivable student loans.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Finally, before I looked at schools, I realized that Audio Books can help prison inmates a great deal,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it is not possible to describe the importance of easy access to beautiful narrated books in prisons.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I would ask celebrities, to specifically create a prison version of a narration,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">a separate narration from what is given to school students.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Some people aren't willing to read for high school kids,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but would be greatly honored, and in fact greatly appreciated, if they narrated great books for inmates.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is so important,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">history will not look kindly at mass incarceration and legal slavery, they will not look kindly at our ignorance and arrogance, and failure to prevent children from becoming criminals.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And here we arrive at an explanation of the very architecture,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">of the new school.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">There is no building, no rent, and no fraudulent moochers, or big fat white lice, not to mention spoiled lemons,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that pretend to teach children.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Parent's don't get to use school as a convenient baby sitter,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">actually the stress of High School and College, exposes children to drugs, school is a pretty nasty baby sitter.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">A tablet, large, free to replace, open source Linux Tablet similar to the <span>PINETAB<sup>[6]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it presented to each student, there is a strong emphasis on socializing, and making friend in real life.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><span>But not behind the brick wall of a class room (trigger warning)<sup>[7]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><span>children are not inmates, they are not meant to sit in rows memorizing noise, so that the teacher can take their fraudulent paycheck home<sup>[8]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">On the tablet there will be a series of programs, similar to the applications on the <span>OLPC XO<sup>[9]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but there will be one web application that will present a game like educational experience.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The students will still have stats, points or grades, this is somewhat kind of, similar to the <span>Dark Souls Player Status<sup>[10]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but here we will see things related to education.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So passing and re-testing the Orbital Dynamics class,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">will increase different stats, like math, physics, astrophysics.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The student while still in school, will be asked to re-play the challenges,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">or games, that are used to refresh and refine their knowledge.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">To mention Kerbal Space Program again,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">students only need to learn how to get into the orbit once, the test are only there to help retain knowledge.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is a real school and a real education,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that is architected in such a way that the students end up getting contracts for well paying jobs, when their stats are high enough to qualify.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">This is Real Education,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and because the student chooses their own path, it also becomes really fun and respectful of their existing predispositions.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The kids that get stuck with making music,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">are my favorite example.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Each school district will have a community of music makers,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">who don't want to get a job, because they already make a lot of money.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The orbital dynamics class example I give here, requires a little bit more explanation,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">not all students that end up in the aerospace industry will begin with love for NASA.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Orbital Dynamics, is needed for several things, Generative Art Classes, Animation Classes, Computer Game Classes,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">whatever requires a decent knowledge of Netwon's calculus.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">So it is not just this Orbital Dynamics class,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">that pops up in a class list on their tablet.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It is used by many courses,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and what makes a course outstanding, is that it helps the student with making money.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Due to money being misunderstood,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">the world is cutting off the oxygen to its collective brain.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The classes presented to the students have to help the out of poverty,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Generative Art is about selling large beautiful canvas, with intricate high resolution computer art.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Some of those graphics, will be created by trails of objects that use Newton's Calculus,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">animation classes lead to a job in graphic arts, providing videos for advertising purposes, or as background to long winded poetry.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And computer game classes, help the students sell apps, and games,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">here lmms is a good example, it helps a person compose in less than an hour, and there are game engines that won't require years of programming.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\"><span>Level design can be a big subject<sup>[11]</sup></span>,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">but a lot of players are a lot better at level design than they assume.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The tools that are used for building the levels,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">are often part of the game, <span>it just makes sense to be within the walls of the game to make the levels more intricate<sup>[12]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Some programming will be required, and that is the area that would call for Orbital Dynamics and Calculus,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">in a first person shooter the math would be related to animations, in a game like <span>asteroids<sup>[13]</sup></span> larger asteroids would attract the smaller ones with the force of gravity.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Graduation is about successfully learning something that results in pushing away poverty,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">in a perfect world education would be more pure, but in a world that misunderstood how to use money, money making must be taught in school.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Jut to repeat my opening remarks,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">schools shy away from real results and noble aims, because they don't know how to educate, they are a place where adults go to make money under the protection of a union and an ineffective cirricula.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Real school is a much more personal experience,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and the access point is a computer tablet with Open Source software, where companies can't trick students into paying for what should be free.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The removal of stress that students experience when they realize they are being forced to pretend to learn by memorization or fail the class,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">will already make a big difference.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Letting the students choose their own path,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and creating paths that help students become financially independent, will take care of the rest.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"break-after\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"section\" style=\"padding-bottom: 1rem;\">References</div>\n  <div>[1]:

  "text": "Let me just open by hypothesizing why schools are not teaching[1],\nit is because they don't actually know how, and since everyone gets paid anyway, they see no reason to fix it[2].\n\nLet us use, learning a photo editing program, as an example,\ntoday schools use multiple choice tests to asses the knowledge of a subject.\nInstead of evaluating the students by for example asking them to create a fake photo,\nhide it among real photographs and let the class try to guess which is the fake one.\nSchools use questions like, what is the purpose of image desaturation?\nA) making it sharper, B) making it lighter, C) all of the above, D) we're pretending to teach to take a paycheck home.\nI know that in a real image editing class, an actual program is used,\nbut the photo editing program we are using here, is an analogy for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.\nIt is meant to demonstrate fake lectures,\nand matching ineffective tests, in serious subject.\n\nBut even in a real photo editing class, the teachers still end up failing the students,\nbecause the real grade would have to be opening a successful photography business and making $100.\nThis could be signing up with Unsplash, and using the site to become a Droneographer or a wedding photographer,\nsee, just learning how to use a photo editing program is useless.\nThe class must begin with photography, center around image editing,\nand passing all the students that now have a functional business.\nSchools can't do this, because it would reveal them as ineffective,\nso as long as we are OK, with them being already ineffective, we are wasting our time, and the time of all the children.\nOh and by the, your kid is not supposed work Fast Food, or Retail,\nthose are not jobs for the children that represent the Future of Human Kind.\nSchools, actually could provide the students with 3 to 10 \"side projects\",\na side project is a miniature business, that makes about a $100 a month.\n\nTo return to our analogy for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology,\nthese subjects are not being tested, the only thing that is tested here is the students ability to temporary memorize.\nThis is fraud, math is actually quite testable,\nbut since schools are not teaching, all the children would fail math on a real test.\nThe math nerds, are not a vote for things working out sometimes,\nthey are self taught, they learn about math, math history, and the underlying concepts on their own, they learn for real.\nThe lectures are ineffective, the tests only test memorization and lying,\nand all the class really teaches is how to cram before a test, which works great for a factory job as well.\nImagine a factory, that would give its employees surprise college entry exams,\nabout every month on average - what would that reveal about the employees, would they all continue passing the surprise tests?\nI would guess,\nthey would all fail with a low score.\nThat is because they only retain what they learned for a few days,\nthey aren't actually educated, they are memorizing.\n\nNow, that I painted a certain picture for you,\nand let you make your own

the tablet there will be a series of programs, similar to the applications on the OLPC XO[9],\nbut there will be one web application that will present a game like educational experience.\nThe students will still have stats, points or grades, this is somewhat kind of, similar to the Dark Souls Player Status[10],\nbut here we will see things related to education.\nSo passing and re-testing the Orbital Dynamics class,\nwill increase different stats, like math, physics, astrophysics.\nThe student while still in school, will be asked to re-play the challenges,\nor games, that are used to refresh and refine their knowledge.\nTo mention Kerbal Space Program again,\nstudents only need to learn how to get into the orbit once, the test are only there to help retain knowledge.\nThis is a real school and a real education,\nthat is architected in such a way that the students end up getting contracts for well paying jobs, when their stats are high enough to qualify.\nThis is Real Education,\nand because the student chooses their own path, it also becomes really fun and respectful of their existing predispositions.\nThe kids that get stuck with making music,\nare my favorite example.\nEach school district will have a community of music makers,\nwho don't want to get a job, because they already make a lot of money.\n\nThe orbital dynamics class example I give here, requires a little bit more explanation,\nnot all students that end up in the aerospace industry will begin with love for NASA.\nOrbital Dynamics, is needed for several things, Generative Art Classes, Animation Classes, Computer Game Classes,\nwhatever requires a decent knowledge of Netwon's calculus.\nSo it is not just this Orbital Dynamics class,\nthat pops up in a class list on their tablet.\nIt is used by many courses,\nand what makes a course outstanding, is that it helps the student with making money.\nDue to money being misunderstood,\nthe world is cutting off the oxygen to its collective brain.\nThe classes presented to the students have to help the out of poverty,\nGenerative Art is about selling large beautiful canvas, with intricate high resolution computer art.\nSome of those graphics, will be created by trails of objects that use Newton's Calculus,\nanimation classes lead to a job in graphic arts, providing videos for advertising purposes, or as background to long winded poetry.\nAnd computer game classes, help the students sell apps, and games,\nhere lmms is a good example, it helps a person compose in less than an hour, and there are game engines that won't require years of programming.\nLevel design can be a big subject[11],\nbut a lot of players are a lot better at level design than they assume.\nThe tools that are used for building the levels,\nare often part of the game, it just makes sense to be within the walls of the game to make the levels more intricate[12].\nSome programming will be required, and that is the area that would call for Orbital Dynamics and Calculus,\nin a first person shooter the math would be related to animations, in a game like asteroids[13] larger asteroids would attract the smaller ones with the force of gravity.\n\nGraduation is about successfully learning something that results in pushing away poverty,\nin a perfect world education would be more pure, but in a world that misunderstood how to use money, money making must be taught in school.\nJut to repeat my opening remarks,\nschools shy away from real results and noble aims, because they don't know how to educate, they are a place where adults go to make money under the protection of a union and an ineffective cirricula.\n\nReal school is a much more personal experience,\nand the access point is a computer tablet with Open Source software, where companies can't trick students into paying for what should be free.\nThe removal of stress that students experience when they realize they are being forced to pretend to learn by memorization or fail the class,\nwill already make a big difference.\nLetting the students choose their own path,\nand creating paths that help students become financially independent, will take care of the rest.\n \nReferences\n[1]:

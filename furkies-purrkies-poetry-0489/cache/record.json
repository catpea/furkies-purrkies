  "text": "\"The World does not have borders, and it belongs to Its Children,\nso that they may share in Peace, Love, and Prosperity\" -- From the opening chapter of The Protocols.\n\nWhen a child takes a mechanical watch apart to see what is inside,\nthey will never be able to put it back together.\nNot with new deals, new policies, new laws, more prisons,\nor college tests that require a purchase, in a paid for class that forced the children to buy overpriced books.\nTo adults who read this,\nthe children, are watching you, the same way you watched you parents.\n\nThere was a breakthrough in Conbinatorial Genomics,\nwe found the \"language\", though I wouldn't call it that.\nThey used statistics, sure as hell, woudn't call it AI,\nto tap into the cumulative adaptive systems.\nThe idea of putting emails into chromosomes to sign the first heavily engineered cell,\nor if you like, artificial life, was so crude, it basically became the new cold fusion announcement fiasco.\nIt was the other way around, we needed a statistical approach to interface with cellular life,\neveryone's attention turned to Combinatorial Genomics, we cured everything.\nBut this is not a story about how we are about to cure aging,\nthis is a story about our Psychology.\n\nThere is no one person in the world that understood all of it completely,\nbut there was a group, that did put it together.\nFriends that admire each other, think like a one enormous unstoppable great mind,\nthey didn't write to the UN, they didn't write to Presitents, they wrote to the Citizens of The World.\nThey created \"The Protocols\", it gives me a headache just saying it,\nThe Protocols are the foundation of the modern society.\nWithout The Protocols, we'd have immortal dictators,\nand a whole lot of evil.\nI share this story, because the thought that started it all,\nsomehow got lost in history, it is important to remember, so that we don't repeat the same mistakes.\n\nBack in 2020 when otherwise hardworking people got sick,\nthey would lose all their savings to pay medical bills.\nThey would have to undo years of mortgage payments,\nand the outcomes were never guaranteed.\nSome families split up on purpose just to protect the home,\nand let the bills end, when the end came.\nPeople would work so hard,\nthat their very neurology would permanently alter.\nPeople were using anti-depressants to medicate away overwork,\njust to survive.\n\nEach of the girls had their own experiences in this area,\nthis wasn't a subject they would talk about.\nBut together thy just knew, they knew, the way young people know,\nthat an end has come.\nThey created a model, they called it The Drake Equation for Human Development,\nand they wrote.\nThey wrote stories, scalding, so angry, powerful, brilliant,\nthat the internet noticed people were leaving their jobs, their papers were changing peoples live for better.\nThen they shared a set of protocols for the advancement of human kind,\nsigned with little more than their initials.\n\n2020 is not a good time to describe the content of The Protocols,\nthat is how powerful they are, that is how deep in trouble the world was.\n\nThe single most powerful and destructive force in the world, are the misguided,\nwho have taken to positions of authority.\nThe only thing that lying politicians can lead to, is a breaking point,\nLying, pretending, fake-it-until-you-make-it, or even hoping, does not belong in world politics - The Authenticity Directive.\nThey call for immediate unmixing of fantasy from reality,\nfact from opinion, and prevention of propagating false beliefs, the solution was termed as Real Education, and relied on free, open access, well narrated Audio Books, in all the world's languages.\nThey ask the young, to plan for illness, to add that into the price of their home, future, and effort,\nand to note that it will cost them more, the more they have - Especially Psychologically - presenting Universal Income as a potential solution.\nFree Health care was just one small issue, there were many more pressing matters,\nlike the damage poverty did to a person's body, brain and neurology, psychology; and above all family.\nAnd, prisons - what have we done - it is true that we are risen apes and not fallen angels,\nbut enough is enough, it must end now, Human Beings get sick from cages - prisons only make people worse.\n\nPersonal Note,\nI grew up watching Rambo and Commando, and Chuck Norris, and my beloved Mr. T,\nsomething happened, and they all changed somehow, and I think it was due to a letter.\nI think a mother lost her boy, and she sent them all a letter saying,\n\"I lost my boy, because he wanted to be like you\".\nI maybe imagining this, but we can all believe in a work similar to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights[1],\nit will be numbered paragraphs, and nobody will ever need to memorize it, or read it in one go.\nIt will take time, but the numbers will go really well together with Growing Up,\nby the time the future generations hit 7, and 9, they will have absolutely understood the first few things that make a Human Noble.\n\nTime never stands still, we must not allow ourselves to be the propagators of history's mistakes,\npointing Nuclear Weapons at each other, is the way of our fathers, it is not our way, the practice must end with their passing.\nThose of us who are born questioning our elders, all too often have their lives end in tragedy,\nit has been like this for hundreds of thousands of years, and it has made us susceptible to indoctrination.\nTime has come to select for other traits,\nso that the future of human kind does not submit, to the mistakes of its elders.\nWe must learn to recognize wisdom from elaborate lies that are only meant to bring selfish comfort to sick old men,\nthose who are born to a world with the internet, have more information, than the elders that will try to warp their minds.\nMay The Protocols become exactly the fury that the world has always feared of,\nand bring the much needed Enlightenment to the human kind.\nThe World,\nWill Grow.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Universal+Declaration+of+Human+Rights",

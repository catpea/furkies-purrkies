  <p>Yes, there are countless ways to share wisdom,<br>but the second to sharing in person, is always, wise books narrated by their authors.</p>

  <p>Maybe start with Rand's shrug,<br>and teach your children to rise, by quoting her book.</p>
  <p>"Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark,<br>in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all.</p>
  <p>Do not let the hero in your soul perish<br>in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach.</p>

  <p>Quote Thoreau,<br>if Vonnegut and Rand are too modern.</p>
  <p>"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,<br>to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,<br>and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.</p>
  <p>I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;<br>nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.</p>
  <p>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,<br>to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,<br>to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms"</p>

  <p>Quote<br>Whitman.</p>
  <p>"Who includes diversity and is Nature,<br>Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,<br>Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,<br>Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,<br>Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,<br>Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,<br>Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,<br>The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;<br>Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,<br>Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,<br>The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together."</p>

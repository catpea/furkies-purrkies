The overwhelming number of liars,
makes it so that the world is not led.

The world is moving at random,
it is all gibberish.

---

But free and open and wise narrated books,
is how the world will be fixed in no time.

Books held in high esteem, chapter here, chapter there...
have the power to restore minds.

---

The library children need; to alter the future,
must be honest, powerful and authentic.

And their classroom must be nature and adventure,
not little prison like classrooms, that you yourselves, couldn't wait to get out of.

---

There is plenty of time to make our way towards wisdom,
and have the liars run for cover.

There is so much time, that you, out of your deepest integrities ,
have more than enough time to learn to write a life changing book.

---

Yes, there are countless ways to share wisdom,
but the second to sharing in person, is always, wise books narrated by their authors.

Let your thoughts add, to create a magnificent treasure, and write it all down,
or just grab a microphone, first, and later... write it all down.

If you don't know where to start,
start with Vonnegut's words.

"True terror is to wake up one morning and discover
that your high school class is running the country."

---

Fix High School,
so that children are not forced to pretend to learn.

That there cannot be such a thing as standard education,
because a growing minds needs adventure not a brain processing factory.

---

Maybe start with Rand's shrug,
and teach your children to rise, by quoting her book.

"Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark,
in the hopeless swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all.

Do not let the hero in your soul perish
in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach.

The world you desire can be won.
It exists.. it is real.. it is possible..."

Quote Thoreau,
if Vonnegut and Rand are too modern.

"I  went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,
and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.

I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear;
nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary.

I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,
to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life,
to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms"

Quote
Whitman.

"Who includes diversity and is Nature,
Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,
Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,
Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,
Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,
Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,
Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,
The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;
Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,
Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together."

Let us all take to wisdom,
so that lairs have no shadow left to slither in.

Only wisdom can keep the future safe,
it is our most magnificent treasure.

May the best of __your__ quotes and poems,
be scattered across countess future writings.

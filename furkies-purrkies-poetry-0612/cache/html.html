  <p>I am always cheerfully up to something artistic or smart,<br>only for a train to toot the horn and ruin my little art.</p>
  <p>I lived most of my life next to train tracks,<br>and the loud noise the horn makes, sucks.</p>

  <p>More than train tracks, the train crossings are awful too,<br>in America they ring a constant bell to annoy you.</p>
  <p>What a wretched thing a train operator is,<br>as when the horn goes off, the fault is all his.</p>

  <p>I always take the philosophical view,<br>always considering the crew.</p>
  <p>Being started countless times by their stupid horn,<br>I view them with nothing but scorn.</p>

  <p>Each time I hear that frightful noise,<br>I see that pushing buttons is something that-ugly-man enjoys.</p>
  <p>He pushes the horn button multiple times in his incompetence,<br>and I call it "horn incontinence".</p>
  <p>I do feel bad that he works nights far away from home,<br>tooting horn to his irritable bowel syndrome.</p>
  <p>But I know his family needs a break,<br>for their own sake.</p>

  <p>Now, I will admit, it was my destiny to drive trains,<br>crisscrossing all the great plains.</p>
  <p>While everyone wanted to become an attorney,<br>I just wanted to go on a fancy train journey.</p>
  <p>There is great wisdom in exploration,<br>out lives should not be lived in resignation.</p>
  <p>Rather than trains I ended up lifting weights,<br>all the way out in Unites States.</p>
  <p>And I don't want to ride trains anymore,<br>I prefer a nice and quiet bookstore.</p>

  <p>Even though I don't want to RIDE the train,<br>I still wish to complain.</p>
  <p>Especially about that damn horn,<br>to which I seem to have been born.</p>

  <p>Let us never forget that the train man could use the horn just one time,<br>instead he plays the song of his people - which should be a crime.</p>
  <p>So next time you are stuck waiting for a train and hear the horn afar,<br><a href="/audio/train.mp3">honk back at him from own your car</a>.</p>

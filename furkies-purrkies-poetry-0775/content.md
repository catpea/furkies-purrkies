I freehand painted a blue nose,
and I got pretty gosh darn close.

The nose did not look like a cucumber.
So twenty portraits must be a magic number.

It was actually easy to sculpt,
and it came out without a fault.

---

Still, at the end of the day,
freehand is not the way.

We should paint real people, and real faces,
and real places.

It is best to practice,
by painting a masterpiece,

---

But I was on a mission,
to improve my style and composition.

---

And I think my next meow,
is painting metal somehow.

It is about glitter makeup or a shiny dress,
but goes far beyond to impress.

For one, suits of armor shining in the sun,
simply cannot be outdone.

They are majestic and mysterious,
and can even a make a bobble head look serious.

Gold is actually a color mix,
a combination of just about six.

And it includes a reflection,
so you have to go in the right direction.

---

Armor, can make a model proud, or seem muscular,
or just handsomely shiny and spectacular.

Plus, who wouldn't want a portrait of old,
in which they hold an enchanted spear and sword.

---

Though we can paint portraits without a hiss,
there is an important lesson in all of this.

Perfect portraits are just THE START,
there is no end to the mastery of art.

And - oh my gosh - photos are teEerrRrrible and ```dull``` things,
unfair, and completely void of feelings.

They must be painted to get the portrait right,
this is why the world needs painters and all their might.

A portrait is not just about the face,
we must often fill __all__ the space.

There is plenty of room to tell a story,
be it superpowers, mystery, or some glory.

---

Perfect portraits are a great might,
but to paint them completely right...

To make the owner smile...
we must paint them in a colorful style.

  <p>I freehand painted a blue nose,<br>and I got pretty gosh darn close.</p>
  <p>The nose did not look like a cucumber.<br>So twenty portraits must be a magic number.</p>
  <p>It was actually easy to sculpt,<br>and it came out without a fault.</p>

  <p>Still, at the end of the day,<br>freehand is not the way.</p>
  <p>We should paint real people, and real faces,<br>and real places.</p>
  <p>It is best to practice,<br>by painting a masterpiece,</p>

  <p>And I think my next meow,<br>is painting metal somehow.</p>
  <p>It is about glitter makeup or a shiny dress,<br>but goes far beyond to impress.</p>
  <p>For one, suits of armor shining in the sun,<br>simply cannot be outdone.</p>
  <p>They are majestic and mysterious,<br>and can even a make a bobble head look serious.</p>
  <p>Gold is actually a color mix,<br>a combination of just about six.</p>
  <p>And it includes a reflection,<br>so you have to go in the right direction.</p>

  <p>Armor, can make a model proud, or seem muscular,<br>or just handsomely shiny and spectacular.</p>
  <p>Plus, who wouldn't want a portrait of old,<br>in which they hold an enchanted spear and sword.</p>

  <p>Though we can paint portraits without a hiss,<br>there is an important lesson in all of this.</p>
  <p>Perfect portraits are just THE START,<br>there is no end to the mastery of art.</p>
  <p>And - oh my gosh - photos are teEerrRrrible and <code>dull</code> things,<br>unfair, and completely void of feelings.</p>
  <p>They must be painted to get the portrait right,<br>this is why the world needs painters and all their might.</p>
  <p>A portrait is not just about the face,<br>we must often fill <strong>all</strong> the space.</p>
  <p>There is plenty of room to tell a story,<br>be it superpowers, mystery, or some glory.</p>

  <p>Perfect portraits are a great might,<br>but to paint them completely right...</p>
  <p>To make the owner smile...<br>we must paint them in a colorful style.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">My 1998 design was a small mp3 decoder equpped Printed Circuit Board (PCB),<br>strapped onto a huge CD-ROM drive filled with a lot of MOD files converted to mp3.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It was meant for a car,<br>but also for learning.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I took a computer hardware class,<br>but it was so simple that it was painful to see my time being wasted.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It was all good people, weird but OK,<br>it is that kind of simplified education that holds everyone back.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">An you know it, everyone was just laid back,<br>the semester passed everyone got an A, and nobody learned a thing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And there was no education to be had,<br>I had to hurry with my English.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I still had bunch of words to learn,<br>it was a high priority item for me, so I spent my teenage years reading paperbacks at Plymouth's Denny's.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Our education has to progress the way water moves through a piece of paper,<br>observe, how it starts as a dot, and then it spreads as far as it can see.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The more it knows the more it grows,<br>we must reject fake education, we mustn't tolerate it.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The player I made today, has a battery where the old CD-ROM was supposed to go,<br>and the PCB is now replaced with an actual GNU/Linux powered Computer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I finished programming the shutter <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cellphone-Shutter-Multifunction-Playback-Smartphones/dp/B08SWC2DQW">thingie</a>,<br>but I didn't even try to figure out the buttons.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The thought hardly occurred to me,<br>the shutter has six buttons that trigger a lot of data.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I can see that a single button press triggers multiple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBfkiprmoi0">light pen actions</a>,<br>that is probably what the kernel calls a finger.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Left and right buttons tiger what maybe to be a swipe,<br>up and down, actually trigger many rows of data, as if counting from 0 to 100.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Holding down the Y-axis key, does something slightly different,<br>it slides values between 0 and possibly 1,000.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The values are always the same,<br>there is no continuation from where the button last left off.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">So if I am always getting the same events,<br>I can just glue (concatenate) all the data and call it a single button.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The long press is a bit off, because the stream of data that long-press sends,<br>ends when a person lets go, it ends at an arbitrary location within that 1,000 virtual key presses.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is really good for changing audio volume,<br>but I'll have to think about it some more.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://github.com/catpea/isir/blob/01ef4b7e55058fde70e5098aad8402345d7e113c/command/learn.js#L51">So the program I wrote, has a learn function that concatenates all button data into a single recognizable ID</a>,<br>and then when the program is in normal operation mode, it <a href="https://github.com/catpea/isir/blob/01ef4b7e55058fde70e5098aad8402345d7e113c/command/listen.js#L41">monitors for the presence of the same flurry of key presses</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When the stored and detected sequence matches,<br>it then <a href="https://github.com/catpea/isir/blob/01ef4b7e55058fde70e5098aad8402345d7e113c/command/listen.js#L49">triggers a command that is manually associated with the ID</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the GNU/Linux commands it triggers are extremely simple,<br>the play button simply <a href="https://github.com/catpea/isir/blob/01ef4b7e55058fde70e5098aad8402345d7e113c/bin/p.sh#L2">stops</a> music if it is already playing and then <a href="https://github.com/catpea/isir/blob/01ef4b7e55058fde70e5098aad8402345d7e113c/bin/p.sh#L3">plays</a> songs from the Music folder, shuffling them first.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Pressing play, multiple times,<br>stops playing current song, and it picks a new one at random, it is surprisingly simple.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I had a fun time this Sunday learning how to manually connect a Bluetooth device,<br>it took me four hours because that little shutter button pad, demands that pairing the device and connecting the device, happens instantly.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I couldn't issue the commands manually, I only had hundreds of milliseconds to go from pair to connect,<br>so it needed to be scripted, the computer had to issue connect right after pairing.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This little $50 of $75 invention is extremely interesting,<br>even for people that like having closed source phones around.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Not only can you control everything from your phone,<br>but also proxy your phone traffic through <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a> a which greatly reduces spam and ads.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The openness of the Raspberry Pi and the underlying GNU/Linux,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDa_odxAGUU">allows for things that aren't possible with closed source phones</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is this kind of tinkering that makes learning GNU/Linux fun and painless,<br>it takes many years, but there is no hurry, in the end being able to reprogram things without investing too much time into custom PCBs is a fun talent to have.</div>

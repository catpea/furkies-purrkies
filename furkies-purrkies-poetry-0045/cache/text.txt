Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Forty.

Everything is all right, except for our flight.
But had we been given infinite light,
our wings would fail in flight.

What gives us the right to learn, and rise to height,
is the limit of the duration of our light.

What makes it precious, and worth the flight,
is precisely the limits in duration of our light.

It is by our limits that we look to light,
had we been given infinite flight,
our intelligence would fail to light.

  <p>Please don’t get discouraged because of strange geometry things,<br>it is an invitation, and so is manual modeling, and even wondering if 3D is something that you actually care for.</p>
  <p>It is all supposed to be just a beginning,<br>you are to demand an infinity to all artistic adventures you set off on.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VYCxaX11U">Blender’s Geometry Nodes are good to learn</a>, they are just a tool,<br>it is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idcFMhoSdIc">geometry modifier</a>, that you program - it is one of many things.</p>

  <p>Schools are not working,<br>and standardized education will eventually be perceived as fraud.</p>
  <p>You need to get your armour on,<br>you need to stand up for your own Education, Knowledge and Excellence.</p>
  <p>Learning an Open Source program is a good investment,<br>even better, if this is your first time learning about 3D Modeling in general.</p>

  <p>You can make a pencil case, a superhero belt, a wallet,<br>you can create animation, or jewelry, and then sell some of those things.</p>
  <p>Maybe a lot of them, but either way, expanding your talents,<br>will give you ideas, it will give you more strength.</p>

  <p>Geometry nodes are new,<br>they are odd, very odd, like a puzzle.</p>
  <p>See some of our greatest inventions,<br>are not built on stable foundations perfectly suited to support them.</p>
  <p>But rather the things beneath are seemingly unrelated,<br>to the end product, more chaotic, or alien even.</p>

  <p>Your favorite story, your treasured paper book,<br>stands upon a tree, that was once likely over a hundred years old.</p>
  <p>Nuclear power, is not actually nuclear,<br>they are just using radioactive materials to boil water to spin a turbine like in old trains.</p>
  <p>You, you are made of Star Stuff, as Mr. Sagan was fond of saying,<br>the universe was all gas until first generation stars started exploding.</p>
  <p>And your golden jewelry, doesn't just come from a dying star,<br>but from an exploding supernova, only those can make heavier elements like Gold.</p>
  <p>Mitochondra in your cells,<br>or the powerhouse of the cell as the schools brainlessly call it.</p>
  <p>That is a separate organism, with a bacterial genome,<br>and although it talks to our cells it divides like bacteria.</p>

  <p>Likewise, programming 3D things, is not exactly about what you are specifically creating,<br>but about concepts in 3D geometry, first .</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEB&search_query=Blender+Geometry+Nodes+Tutorial">At first you just learn from tutorials</a>,<br>and later that knowledge will come together to make more sense.</p>
  <p>But when you are making abstract jewelry,<br>noting there will ever be about jewelry, that world is about geometry.</p>
  <p>The jewelry world above it,<br>starts with taking what you can of the underlying geometry world.</p>
  <p>And then improving that, expanding it,<br>to create a ring, pendant or earring, that is impossible for a human hand to make.</p>
  <p>It is just unfair to ask a human to do it,<br>abstract geometry...</p>
  <p>In every sense,<br>is not of this world.</p>
  <p>In some cases it can be said that it is an emergent phenomenon,<br>born of human curiosity, the world of 3D geometry, and plenty of happy little accidents.</p>

Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Nine,
A vegetable juice out of line.
The Tomato with Sprinkles was born of accident,
when making my salad, this is how it went;
The salad bag tore,
and some of the salad went on the floor.
But a fistful, fell in my tomato juice,
and decorated it with sprinkles of produce.
It is hard to recommend, but I must say,
it tasted great, and I'll drink it everyday.

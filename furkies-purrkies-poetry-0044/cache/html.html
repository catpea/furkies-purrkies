  <p>The Tomato with Sprinkles was born of accident,</p>
  <p>when making my salad, this is how it went;</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The salad bag tore,</p>
  <p>and some of the salad went on the floor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>But a fistful, fell in my tomato juice,</p>
  <p>and decorated it with sprinkles of produce.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>It is hard to recommend, but I must say,</p>
  <p>it tasted great, and I&apos;ll drink it everyday.</p>

  <p>I think the idea of a programmer will fade away,<br>as it will be replaced by the modern teenager.</p>
  <p>I think smartphones are already too stupid,<br>and the next big thing is a programmable phone.</p>
  <p>That is how quickly times are changing,<br>smartphones are a relic.</p>

  <p>I recently discovered that there is something neat,<br>that we can do to hasten this transformation.</p>
  <p>We have to race to meet the new intellectual,<br>with self guided integrated development environments.</p>
  <p>No newcomer to programming should ever wonder,<br>where to put the code.</p>
  <p>The boxes for the code, along with a build button,<br>should already be on the screen.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOGru_4z1Vc">Mr. Vonnegut presented us with the idea that stories have shape</a>,<br>and same is the case for every useful programming pattern.</p>
  <p>That shape is always very simple,<br>as it is rarely visualized with a friendly GUI.</p>
  <p>The old school programmer had a terminal,<br>the whippersnappers have electron, the madmen have eclipse.</p>
  <p>And none of it is friendly, even the modern web based editor,<br>is just a spicy text editor, little more than a 1980’s terminal.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>There are some shapes that do get complex,<br>Object Oriented Programming comes to mind .</p>
  <p>And same is the case with Aspect Oriented Programming,<br>OOP Mixins, and Multiple Inheritance</p>
  <p>These would be greatly improved with a specialized editor,<br>but these technologies still fail, no matter the user interface.</p>
  <p>They create too much complexity,<br>any which way.</p>

  <p>On a much smaller scale the Event Emitter,<br>is incredibly friendly.</p>
  <p>It is just a listener,<br>and bunch of functions that crunch the data it receives.</p>
  <p>And Linux command line commands are friendly too,<br>sweet configuration arguments, the input stream is any, and then just the error and output streams.</p>
  <p>They are similar to an Event Emitter,<br>and in fact node streams are made with the use of the Emitter.</p>
  <p>I mention modern JavaScript for creation of commands,<br>because of how many places the JavaScript programmer can reach.</p>
  <p>Linux Command Line, SVG Graphics, Electron Desktop Applications,<br>Web Sites, Web Servers.</p>
  <p>C or C++ would greatly slow a programmer down,<br>not so with JavaScript.</p>

  <p>Finally, I will just describe the shape of an EventEmitter,<br>and I will even throw in unit tests to the mix.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

</div>
<div class="section">
  <p>The shape is three columns,<br>underlined by the code editor.</p>
  <p>In the first column we have<br>an editable list of all the events where user can add more.</p>
  <p>When we select an event,<br>from the first column.</p>
  <p>In the second column we get a list of the functions,<br>that process the object the Event Listener receives.</p>
  <p>And when we click on a function,<br>yes the associated code does appear on the bottom of all three columns.</p>
  <p>But also the third column will display the unit tests,<br>that are used to check if the function is complete and correct.</p>
  <p>Three columns, List of Events, list of event functions, and list of function tests,<br>and wherever there is some code to edit, it can be edited in the editor.</p>
  <p>That is usually the function code,<br>and the unit test code.</p>

  <p>By clicking build a code generator will gather everything up,<br>and create a perfect little module that can be committed to a proper repository.</p>
  <p>Such a program would be installed on the user’s commuter,<br>so there is no need for servers here.</p>

  <p>Aside from being a very neat way,<br>to learn programming, this project comes with a powerful benefit.</p>
  <p>While the programmer has a useful interface,<br>they get to look at the code generator output.</p>
  <p>And see how their functions are integrated,<br>into EventEmitters and node modules, or command line applications.</p>

  <p>I think, at first, the new intellectual, the programmer,<br>will end up viewing that code the way we view obfuscated or transpiled code.</p>
  <p>They will eventually get to know how it all works,<br>but it won’t be a priority.</p>
  <p>Precisely because these luxury code editors,<br>help the programmer focus on code, and not boilerplate.</p>

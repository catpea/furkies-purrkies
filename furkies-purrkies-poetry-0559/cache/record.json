  "text": "I could see the people who knew High School was fake, or at least trouble,\nall three principals knew, and the English teacher.\nThe English teacher,\ntried to pass on a message.\nHe didn’t care about anything but that message, the message was:\n“The choices we make dictate the life we lead, to thine own self be true.[1]”.\nThe third principal put up an experimental class to try to get a read on us,\nI was the control sample, that was the semester I dropped out.\n(I am not 100% sure he became a principal,\nsomeone who had his last name was a principal few years ago.)\nIt is good data,\nI hope he used it.\nHe had another message,\n“Wherever you go there you are.”\nThis message means that you can’t run away, or move somewhere, or escape something,\nthat the change must come from within.\nThe reason I ended up as the control sample, was because the news class teacher,\nand let me just say to this day I don’t know what a news class is...\nWas unstable, presumably attempting to be funny,\nI am 95% sure he licked his finer and put it in one of the sleeping student’s ear.\nI needed to leave that class,\nbecause it was creepy - I don’t remember what my plan was - but I was exploring the school corridors when the experimental class teacher grabbed me.\n\nThe class would always open by asking the students how they really feel,\nand the teacher said, not to say I am fine, becasue that meant f’d-up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional.\nSo the kids would talk about their lives,\nthe assistant psychologist would scribble things in the corner.\nThese were real feelings, real concerns,\nreal experiences.\nBut there was a problem\nwith what the teachers were trying to do.\nAnd they were getting corrupted feedback from us,\nas a result of the problem.\nSunaura Taylor[2] has this heartbreaking, powerful, gut wrenching, screaming, work of art,\nthat brings me to tears every time I think about it.\nThat perfectly captures, why they were getting shit data from us,\nit is part of her “Factory Farms[3]” set, entitled “Chicken Truck[4]”\nSo, we were reporting how we were doing relative to the world we knew,\nand the world we knew in High School was pretty sad.\nIn order to report how we were really doing in school, and in life.\nwe needed to know more about life.\nAt the very least... we needed to make weekly trips to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit Historical Museum, Detroit Zoo, Michigan Science Center, Bell Isle Park, ride the People Mover,\nwe needed to be at every performance of the Michigan Opera and Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and never miss a new show at the DIA.\nThe most important thing we needed was a plan out of poverty,\nmeaning we needed help with building our companies.\nIn case this is somehow too new, or too unrealistic,\nplease, please, realize that, the first company the class would have co-founded together, was going to take care of getting students to visit all those places and more - we’d have lectures all around the city.\nInstead, we were just reporting how we were doing,\nin Sunaura’s Chicken Truck.\nWe were,\nF.I.N.E.\n\nHigh School is our first real problem,\nand not letting it crush us, is our first battle against invisible prison walls.\nWe can push the walls back - well enough,\nbut we can’t see what is outside.\nWe couldn't answer how we were doing,\nanymore than a person who spent his life in a cubicle could\n\nI think we need to be more cautious,\nabout letting other people convince us that they have all the answers.\nAnd we need to keep in mind,\nthat some people will not be aware they are hurting us.\nThis is probably what “road to hell is paved with good intentions” means,\npeople being tricked into thinking they are helping.\nIt may not be safe to believe,\nthat schools are going to make the future certain for us.\nIn military the recruiter always lies[5],\nthere will be no Charger, no Camaro, what you sometimes get is being scared of fireworks for the rest of your life.\nIn science or medicine, even if we set aside the 400,000 yearly deaths from medical errors,\ngetting into science does nothing for Mental Health, Wisdom and Greatness.\nIf schools tried to help us for real,\nco-founding businesses, constantly reading beautiful biographies would be the first and foremost.\nAnd that is what we need to do,\nset aside the stupid ideas of grades, and that diploma which is made worthless by schools forcing us to memorize like little actors.\nAnd we need to focus on building companies,\ninstead of working for them.\nYou can still have your medical carrier,\nbut here you will no longer be discarded when they realize that you can be replaced with two cheaper employees.\nYou can still be a scientist,\nfind your won co-founders, get investors to help you build powerful laboratories.\n\nBut above all,\nour education needs to be Real.\nI know,\nyou are in a chicken truck on this one.\nIt is hard to know what a real education is,\nbut we can get past this, by reading biographies.\nBiographies are something else,\nreal people, real lives, real struggles and - my goodness - real wisdom.\nBiographies only sound boring,\nthey are stories of adventure, adventure in life.\nYou should absolutely,\nstart with the stories that interest you.\nThe whole point is to become inspired,\nand a little bit wiser.\nThe books that people adore that seem uninteresting to you,\nor maybe seem too hard to read, are actually things you leave for later.\nSome books may seem confusing the first time you listen to them,\nbut that is only because you are reaching too far, your on-ramp is too steep.\nFor example, before you start reading philosophy,\nyou should read about the philosophers, and then about the work you are trying to read.\nOr before you get to Shakespeare,\nyou should read everything about him, and then study guides, and kind of like him as a person, or persons as the case may be.\n\nUnderstanding life is important,\nand it will absolutely help you see where to go next.\nBiographies, or Stories of Wisdom and Adventures in Life as they should be called,\nare probably the best way to look outside of high school, outside of all the cages in life.\nI know we are all extremely intelligent, that we can learn anything,\nand before we know it we start becoming wise.\nLearning is about going at your own pace,\nand learning in a sequence that fit what you already know; that fit you best.\nWisdom is about thinking of new solutions, to new problems,\nby subtle analogy to the things that you know, to the things that you have learned from wise beings.\nAnd then beyond Knowledge and Wisdom,\nis Greatness.\nMost of the books worth reading,\nwill be written by Great Beings.\nGreat beings are the people that change the world for better,\nthey are the true force that drives the advancement of Human Kind.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0o2Vc_57hSI&t=118s\n[2]: http://www.sunaurataylor.com/\n[3]: http://www.sunaurataylor.com/portfolio/Factory%20Farms\n[4]: http://www.sunaurataylor.com/portfolio/Factory%20Farms/details/Chicken%20Truck\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkSh4JCUXro",

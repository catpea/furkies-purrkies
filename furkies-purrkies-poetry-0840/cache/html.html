  <p>And such is the world as you see it today,<br>uneducated leaders spewing propaganda to see what will stick and stay.</p>
  <p>Drifting towards a future they can't foresee,<br>a future where our world simply cannot be free.</p>
  <p>Are we all so squeezed by poverty,<br>that we can't see how mighty we can be?</p>
  <p>All the while, the liars and ghouls,<br>expect us to become their tools.</p>
  <p>Be it war, or constantly asking for more-more-more,<br>or giving up on human rights, or forcing us to climb fake heights.</p>

  <p>A generation can't face a ghoul,<br>to whom to whom it is but an expendable tool.</p>
  <p>Nor can it change the future by forcing its will,<br>or thinking that some part of the world <strong>must</strong> remain ill.</p>
  <p>We must leave that dark blindness behind,<br>and learn, and read, and bring light to our mind.</p>
  <p>We can't just keep asking lairs for change or hope,<br>that will only make the ghouls hand us, the end of the rope.</p>

  <p>But by knowing that your generation is misrepresented and mislead,<br>by taking to great challenges, and becoming well read.</p>
  <p>By learning for real, and by making it so that everyone knows.<br>you <strong>can</strong> repair where it all goes.</p>
  <p>By inviting all the others to grow as well,<br>you <strong>will</strong> end the cycle, and bid the ghouls farewell.</p>
  <p>Learn and rise to no end, because what <strong>you</strong> really need, is to know,<br>is that you all are the fabric of tomorrow.</p>

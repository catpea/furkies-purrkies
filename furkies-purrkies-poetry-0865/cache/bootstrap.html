    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was camping at a tent site some minutes into the State Park,<br>I started my fire and made some hot dogs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And a family with two or three teenagers,<br>started unpacking next to my site.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was wearing my leather Wolverine Jacket,<br>listing to an ancient iPod.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I think it was,<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_in_90_Minutes_series">Paul Strathern's Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I started chatting with my new neighbors,<br>I might have given them some firewood or maybe batteries, probably bug spray.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And as they took their weight off their feet,<br>I started speaking to the Mom about Audio Books.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I just carefully described the power and importance,<br>of connecting with Philosophers and Thinkers.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">" Is this want you do?" she asked pointing at my car,<br>it was the first time I spoke, the way I speak now.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I hope I didn't make them sad,<br>I was just on an adventure.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Before falling asleep that night I remember listening to,<br><a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Im-a-Stranger-Here-Myself-Audiobook/B009I24FUC">Bill Bryson’s I'm a Stranger Here Myself</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Where he mentioned that Grover Cleveland a former US president,<br>used to pee out of the Oval Office window.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is a very, education book,<br>it certainly helps you remember Grover Cleveland.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They were whispering sweet nothings to each other,<br>enjoying the shade of the gigantic pines.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I pouuuuuuuuuunced out of the woods, somewhat screaming,<br>as a proper man of the mountain would...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And started cheerfully renewing my parking permit,<br>for another couple of weeks, it was lyke, maybe $15 dollards.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We chatted for a moment,<br>they said they’ve been visiting every year since the 70’s.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It used to be free, they said,<br>I mentioned the more rustic trail head still has some free parking on it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They started on their cute little journey,<br>up the nearby ancient dune, and we parted ways smiling.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There used to be an observation platform too,<br>and it was like 80 million gazillion stairs.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">By the time people scrambled up there,<br>they had to whip out trail-mix and snacks to recharge.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When I first experimented with a wall projector,<br>I showed my raccoon drawing to the State Park lady.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And she thought they were good,<br>I think I remember here mentioning that she used to look after wild animals.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Soon thereafter, to my shock, I discovered there were tame Deer,<br>in the state park.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They probably wouldn't appreciate hugs,<br>but were not scared of me, which actually really scared me.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It was like discovering a new animal,<br>that could give you chase, and possibly bite you.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Because by the lake, you are not just on a beach,<br>but also it feels like a deserted island.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Unless you sneeze with extra effort and a hoo during a holiday,<br>goodness knows why there were so many people just scattered around in the tall grass.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There are non-bity snakes in there,<br>tan by the beach for goodness sake.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When you step into the woods, there is such a drastic change,<br>the air is full of trees, and heavy with moisture.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The sun is hardy to be seen through the thick canopy,<br>it literally just blinks and leaves you alone.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And if you come across a cluster of Pine Trees,<br>the fragrance and extra shade is like dipping into an evening for a moment.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even if you do climb the dune and find a sunny spot,<br>it is nothing like being down at the beach.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I can’t explain it,<br>but it is a different season up there, kind of a different sun.</div>

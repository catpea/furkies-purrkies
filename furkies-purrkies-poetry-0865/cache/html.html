  <p>I was camping at a tent site some minutes into the State Park,<br>I started my fire and made some hot dogs.</p>
  <p>And a family with two or three teenagers,<br>started unpacking next to my site.</p>
  <p>I was wearing my leather Wolverine Jacket,<br>listing to an ancient iPod.</p>
  <p>I think it was,<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_in_90_Minutes_series">Paul Strathern's Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series</a>.</p>
  <p>I started chatting with my new neighbors,<br>I might have given them some firewood or maybe batteries, probably bug spray.</p>
  <p>And as they took their weight off their feet,<br>I started speaking to the Mom about Audio Books.</p>
  <p>I just carefully described the power and importance,<br>of connecting with Philosophers and Thinkers.</p>
  <p>" Is this want you do?" she asked pointing at my car,<br>it was the first time I spoke, the way I speak now.</p>
  <p>I hope I didn't make them sad,<br>I was just on an adventure.</p>
  <p>Before falling asleep that night I remember listening to,<br><a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Im-a-Stranger-Here-Myself-Audiobook/B009I24FUC">Bill Bryson’s I'm a Stranger Here Myself</a>.</p>
  <p>Where he mentioned that Grover Cleveland a former US president,<br>used to pee out of the Oval Office window.</p>
  <p>It is a very, education book,<br>it certainly helps you remember Grover Cleveland.</p>

  <p>Another time a cute couple was standing by the map,<br>where the parking envelopes are.</p>
  <p>They were whispering sweet nothings to each other,<br>enjoying the shade of the gigantic pines.</p>
  <p>I pouuuuuuuuuunced out of the woods, somewhat screaming,<br>as a proper man of the mountain would...</p>
  <p>And started cheerfully renewing my parking permit,<br>for another couple of weeks, it was lyke, maybe $15 dollards.</p>
  <p>We chatted for a moment,<br>they said they’ve been visiting every year since the 70’s.</p>
  <p>It used to be free, they said,<br>I mentioned the more rustic trail head still has some free parking on it.</p>
  <p>They started on their cute little journey,<br>up the nearby ancient dune, and we parted ways smiling.</p>

  <p>That dune that goes way up there,<br>and back then just when you thought you got to the top...</p>
  <p>There used to be an observation platform too,<br>and it was like 80 million gazillion stairs.</p>
  <p>By the time people scrambled up there,<br>they had to whip out trail-mix and snacks to recharge.</p>
  <p>Though there were plenty of benches to sit on,<br>and an interesting long-ish litte walk way.</p>
  <p>That I soon discovered,<br>went, in a circle.</p>

  <p>I have lots of memories from Nordhouse,<br>it seems like it was more like Myhouse.</p>
  <p>When I first experimented with a wall projector,<br>I showed my raccoon drawing to the State Park lady.</p>
  <p>And she thought they were good,<br>I think I remember here mentioning that she used to look after wild animals.</p>
  <p>Soon thereafter, to my shock, I discovered there were tame Deer,<br>in the state park.</p>
  <p>They probably wouldn't appreciate hugs,<br>but were not scared of me, which actually really scared me.</p>
  <p>It was like discovering a new animal,<br>that could give you chase, and possibly bite you.</p>

  <p>And there was a mom and a daughter, high up on horses,<br>just the moment I disgraced myself by trying to force my trunk to close for like two minutes.</p>
  <p>...I was jumping up and down, and squishing and moving, and fidgeting,<br>and all of a sudden there was trot, trot, trot, of two sophisticated ladies.</p>
  <p>I have a half memory of them wearing lavish hats up on their high horses,<br>and being mildly entertained by my behavior.</p>

  <p>I think by far my favorite memory is about,<br>what I could almost call the different seasons of Nordhouse.</p>
  <p>Because by the lake, you are not just on a beach,<br>but also it feels like a deserted island.</p>
  <p>Unless you sneeze with extra effort and a hoo during a holiday,<br>goodness knows why there were so many people just scattered around in the tall grass.</p>
  <p>There are non-bity snakes in there,<br>tan by the beach for goodness sake.</p>

  <p>When you step into the woods, there is such a drastic change,<br>the air is full of trees, and heavy with moisture.</p>
  <p>The sun is hardy to be seen through the thick canopy,<br>it literally just blinks and leaves you alone.</p>
  <p>And if you come across a cluster of Pine Trees,<br>the fragrance and extra shade is like dipping into an evening for a moment.</p>
  <p>Even if you do climb the dune and find a sunny spot,<br>it is nothing like being down at the beach.</p>
  <p>I can’t explain it,<br>but it is a different season up there, kind of a different sun.</p>

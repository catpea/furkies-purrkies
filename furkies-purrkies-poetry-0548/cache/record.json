  "text": "You know that scene in 1989 Batman, where he grabs Vicki Vale,\npoints what looks like a weapon at Joker, presses the trigger, the weapon does something utterly useless,\nand then as they fly out the door with Ms. Vale fake screaming...\nthe unhinged Joker goes: \"Where does he get these wonderful toys?\"\nTo answer the question,\nhe designs them himself.\n\nUseless and strange functionality,\nlike a red button, in the sea of yellow, lies at the heart, of actually owning something for real.\nThat is my vision of a reasonable wallet,\nit comes with a dangerous looking button.\nThat upon a press, extends its wings,\nthe wings just happen to hold the bolts of the locking mechanism.\n\nI am happy with a 3D printed plastic version,\nbut it is possible to print it as wax, and then cast it in Aluminum.\nUnless you design something yourself,\nthe true owners are the Artists, Designers, and Engineers that created it.\nThe Pink Elephant in the Industrial Design room,\nis the fact that people can only own copies of the product.\n\nNot only should we own 3D printers, desktop laser cutters and milling machines,\nbut we also need to learn the software.\nThere is nothing more fascinating than learning how to build a hinge for your Purse or Wallet,\nplus it maybe something that people who just like knickknacks, maybe interested in purchasing.\nNot to mention building your favorite gadgets inside out, at sub millimeter precision scale,\nand spending a whole half hour examining the magnificence of your first mechanical device - yikes!\n\n3D printers are not just about printing other people's designs from the internet,\nbut creating your own, so that you can actually truly own them.\nYou know how you go to a museum,\nand you don't really know what style, or period, or even type of thing you are into?\nOnce you start designing your own products, you will snap into your own style, period, type, genre, and every other category there is,\nyour own designs, are your reference point, to every other piece of art - to your own class and style.\n\nI am not much of a car person, precisely because the only people that can really own a car,\nare the Artists and Engineers that made it.\nBut for the first time in my life, I clicked on Automania over at the Museum of Modern Art in New York,\nI've3 been staring at the 1960 Airstream Bambi Travel Trailer, deeply unhappy about the square windows.\nMy goodness, can you imagine the Bambi with with beautiful Yacht-like portholes[1], what a piece of art that would be,\nI wouldn't have noticed the atrocity, if I wasn't examining the fancy round corners for my own product designs.\n\nAnd High School, where individuality and originality still maters, thank goodness,\nonce the Highschoolers figure out how easy it is to become an Industrial Product Designers.\nThey will realize that Maclemore, was actually warning them in his Thrift Shop song[2],\nthat paying extra for other peoples designs, is just getting tricked by a business.\nBlender modeling tutorials and 3D printers, are not only essential for a Highschooler,\nthey are critical, because that is the difference between getting tricked and being original - and they are already getting tricked by the crappy education they are getting[3].\n\n3D Modeling original creations and printing them out on 3D printers,\ncreates an interesting career path.\nHigh school diploma, and college debt is supposed to lead us to a career,\nbut in the modern age it just takes a few hours of tutorials to get ready to sell things on online.\nIt is possible to just sell 3D models, like a modern armored Batman for $3[4],\nor printed models like ugly $20 wallets[5], or $25 cosplay masks[6], or $200 futuristic cannons[7] with LED lights.\n\nWhat is incredible about this,\nthat nothing needs to be printed until it is actually sold.\nOnline stores often have a number of sales listed,\nthe simple Cosplay mask I was looking at sold 7,913 copies which at $24 comes to $189,912.\nIt maybe rare to make that much money from 3D printed models,\nbut it is a fine entry point into the world of business - and it certainly makes for powerful daydreams that crush the threat of poverty.\n\nIn closing, I would like to add that creating products is not just about 3D modeling, and 3D printers,\nit is about learning, and prototyping.\nOnce a person learns the work-flow and prototypes some BASIC models, they can then pay an experienced designer to create something that they completely understand,\ngiving the 3D modeler instructions on the subject of decorations, hinges, even texture - and taking that model to an online store that will do the printing for them.\nUnderstanding 3D printing, also marks the comprehension of fabrication, at this point CNC milling machines are a matter of an email to a designer,\nmoving from plastic to metal takes no effort, and here high quality products can be shipped at high prices.\nNot all products require weeks of assembly, the tinkerers are quite satisfied buying kits that are yet to be assembled,\nsuch could be the case with a wallet that comes with a dozen of components and is pure delight to put together with little screw drivers and fancy brass screws.\nCreating a metallic terminator skeleton kit[8], which sells for about $1,000 to $3,000[9] and probably beyond,\ncan certainly get a company started.\nAnd what great joy for a young person would it be to both receive shipments of metal or resin terminator skeleton components for painting and sale[10],\nand have a small army in the garage for those who wish to have it shipped overnight - mark my words; any expedition into the world of Fabrication is Bee's Knees.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/314/4070\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QK8mJJJvaes\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4\n[4]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1053287872/tl-batman-3d-print-model-diorama-dc\n[5]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/758508704/hardshell-wallet-credit-card-holder-3d\n[6]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/980724019/anime-battle-mech-cosplay-mask-made-in\n[7]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/900900492/cold-gun-cosplay-3d-printed-leds-stand\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKflhTrRh2k\n[9]: https://www.etsy.com/listing/903647318/terminator-t-800-full-scale-resin-cast\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYfeGfMey24",

  "text": "It will all start with a young lady tracking the loss of species[1],\nand keeping an eye on the climate - and what we are doing about both.\nTo put it bluntly,\nshe will say “That’s F-ing Enough.”\nAnd this is not an ordinary F-word,\nthis phrase once uttered, is a dreadful phrase.\nAs it creates a crease,\na separation between generations.\n\nThe students understand the urgency of the situation,\nbetter than us.\nAnd there is a lot of students,\nin the world.\n\nBut they still need our help with the fundamentals,\nas those fall under indoctrination and are harder to see than climate and loss of species.\nIt takes a classroom to list all the problems in one go,\nwhile the following list is short, it is worded differently.\nWhere the Great Michele Alexander may say,\n“we must put an end to the disproportionate mass incarceration”, the children will make a shorter version.\nNo more prisons.\nIt is the crease, the separation, they will not be seeking congress, they will not look to make connections,\nthe emperor will be naked.\nSo it is is not just climate change and loss of species, you see,\nthey will have enough of all the liars and half measures, and deals and delays.\nI like to think of these as new amendments to the constitutions,\nall around the world.\n28th Amendment will just have three words,\nNo more prisons.\nThe 29th Amendment, also three words,\nNo more poverty.\nThe 30th amendment, very noble,\nA politician or any kind, including Representatives and Congress People,\nwill not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do.\nThis one inspired by the Cadet Honor Code at West Point,\nand makes false promises and lying a punishable offense under the new criminal justice system, a minimum of 50 years of meaningful daily community service.\nThe 31st amendment will address war, and it is just three words again,\nNo More Killing\nAnd the 32 amendment, will make all government employees earn at most minimum wage,\nas any politician will surely admit it was never about the money.\nThe 33rd amendment,\nwill shut down all educational institutions that fail to provide results,\nbased on evaluating student success in real life.\nThe children will spend entire semesters drafting amendments,\na lot of them will not pass at the moment of writing, due to psychological limitations of the drafty emperors.\nOf course, this will not be a problem,\nfor they are the soon to be the new Representatives and Congressmen, Presidents, and Prime Ministers.\n\nIt will be up to the politicians to implement the end of poverty,\nit is rather easy, food-medical-educational-housinf-need charges will always process through, though the governments will haggle like hell.\nThe challenge will be in making these changes global,\nand the uniformity of this wiser system will encourage limitations.\nThere will be a little more than a single point that needs to be made,\nto clean up the plastics. For every new kilogram of plastic, ten killograms must be scooped up out of dumps, rivers, lakes, seas and oceans.\nIt is an easy cleanup system,\nit is very challenging to the industries that caused the pollution - the children will love that.\n\nWith the end of poverty and birth of effective education, there will be little that can’t be done,\nand smart money that evaluates the purchases as they are made will ensuring economic stability.\n\nClimate change and loss of species are already presenting clear evidence,\nand will prove that the emperor is naked.\nTo upset the younger generations this way,\nis to unravel the world.\nWe had an opportunity to elect the correct president in US,\nbut people were simply too uneducated and thus mislead.\n\nIt is not their fault, the schools have never become,\nwhat the promise of schools hinted on.\n\nEven if elected four or eight years of educated policy making whilst hoping that the world will follow,\nthat was far too little.\nThe chance we had, requited a lot of change, a lot of work,\nwe didn't stand a chance.\nHow many adults don’t laugh at free home and money,\nunder a Strong Universal Income Plan... it is almost funny to ask isn’t it.\nImagine a life without wage slavery,\na world of well educated voters.\nA world where a teacher in their Dignity,\nwill not lower quality of lectures, to increase their work performance score.\n\nSleepy Humanity needed to witness climate change and loss of species,\nincluding soon to be lost Tigers and Orangutans, to see that the politicians were as ineffective as the schools.\nHence the three dreadful words,\nin the opening of the poem.\nThat mark the separation between generations,\nand the mach of children and students at capitols.\n\nWe have to help them understand that existence of prisons and poverty is a mistake,\nwe have to help them associate it with the mistake of war.\nWe have to help them see, that we made many mistakes, not just climate change and loss of species,\nthey have to upgrade the way money works, and the way we grow up - crime is meant to be prevented, prisons only cause greater harm.\nWe have to show that the civilization they are born into is young,\nthat everyone of them must contribute some change for better, as they each grow in kindness, knowledge, compassion, wisdom, greatness and vision.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ref=u.s.-fish-and-wildlife-service-proposes-delisting-23-species-from-&_ID=37017",

  <p>I think, that we have to stop participating it passing on errors,<br>Poverty, Nuclear Weapons, Mass Incarceration, Police Brutality, War - are all errors.</p>
  <p>None of this should make it into the next generation,<br>it is cruel to act as if Mass Incarceration is mistake that we just have to get used to - it isn't.</p>
  <p>It is very strange to witness politicians doing as little as possible,<br>and for us to just simply accept it as Bureaucracy or Politics.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it would be too much to ask of ourselves to fix all this,<br>after all we have inherited most of this mess ourselves.</p>
  <p>But being vocal and intolerant of these errors,<br>should be our duty, to the younger generations.</p>
  <p>In order to establish a way to communicate these complex ideas,<br>we must immediately cease to tolerate fake education.</p>

  <p>A lot of people still don't know,<br>their education was fake.</p>

  <p>One of the sickest things that comes out of that dog and pony show,<br>is students being tricked into thinking they are "just not that smart".</p>

  <p>For those of you who are right at the tipping point,<br>the book you are looking for is Short History Of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson.</p>

  <p>The first one-hundred books are extremely important,<br>they will help you catch up.</p>

  <p>Real Education is an education that leaves you with abilities that you frequently use,<br>either directly, or to build on, or by subtle analogy to something else.</p>
  <p>Fake education teachers you to need common denominators,<br>real education shows you that it is a misunderstanding to just try to add fractions from different denominator worlds.</p>
  <p>The teachers are doing such a terrible job,<br>they aren't explaining things in ways that are compatible with what we already know.</p>
  <p>And math class is for killing math,<br>the best class to learn real mathematics from is Programming and Generative Art.</p>

  <p>Seth Shostak says that the way we can tell a Species is intelligent,<br>is whether or not they can make a radio.</p>
  <p>We need to know how to compose music, fix electronics,<br>how to program computers, how to use 3D printers, how to model 3D objects and characters - and how to make a radio.</p>
  <p>We weren't even taught how to draw,<br>all it takes is a photo and a projector, and then some pencils and blending stumps.</p>
  <p>It sounds silly to mention such simple things,<br>but this mode of thinking shows, that we have been robbed.</p>

  <p>I hope it is not bad news, when I say,<br>sculpture is more powerful than diamonds.</p>
  <p>Diamonds are everywhere,<br>but a uniquely sculpted pendant or ring is rare.</p>
  <p>This is good news for 3D printed jewelry,<br>as it can be shipped directly to the customer.</p>
  <p>It just needs a bit of polish,<br>there are no stones to set, no intricate parts to detail.</p>
  <p>People who are printing or casting your ring,<br>will take care of it.</p>

  <p>Purely geometric 3D jewelry is very interesting,<br>but it is abstract.</p>
  <p>I highly encourage creating a scared geometry,<br>line of rings, even if just for practice.</p>
  <p>And just as highly I encourage,<br>to create a line of rings, pendants, bracelets, and earrings.</p>
  <p>Where the stones aren’t so much set,<br>but slid int to the bands or construction.</p>
  <p>Just to be cleverly secured,<br>possibly with a clever removable gate.</p>

  <p>But creating a frog ring, with three or four frogs,<br>or maybe one big one, is so much more.</p>
  <p>It is mysterious, meaningful (if that is the little critter that your customer chooses),<br>private, personal and extremely unique.</p>
  <p>Every piece of jewelry has a message,<br>and all things considered.</p>
  <p>White diamonds have a message too,<br>along with a dark history, and artificially set price.</p>
  <p>It maybe just me, but a collection of well worn beach glass,<br>that was collected by the customer, on beaches around the world.</p>
  <p>Cut to size, maybe polished, and encapsulated in a pendant or ring,<br>has a more colorful story to tell, even though it begun, as discarded glass.</p>

  <p>But a ring, or an entire collection, of all kinds of things,<br>that share the same sculptures, that is just unbeatable.</p>
  <p>Especially since, that same sculpture,<br>can be brought to the big world, as a five inch figurine of a collection thre of.</p>
  <p>You could even design a series of spoons, coin pendants,<br>even invitation cards and logos.</p>

  <p>And if it is not too much to suggest,<br>you could use the same 3D models you sculpted.</p>
  <p>In a painting, where you would first map out the scene and lighting in Blender,<br>and then take to Krita where you could use that scene as a Reference Image.</p>
  <p>And if that wasn't too much to ask,<br>then <a href="https://www.popular.pics/reddit/subreddits/posts?r=artefactporn&sort=top&t=all">learn a sculpting style from out ancient ancestors</a>.</p>
  <p>And paint a series of paintings displaying them in full dignity and glory,<br>presenting the multiple paintings in a silent graphic novel.</p>
  <p>And just name your collection after the culture that connected with you,<br>become a modern caretaker of the style, of their most decorative works.</p>

  <p>You don’t have to set the price to be astronomically high,<br>and some collections can be sold a few hundred times.</p>
  <p>But not countless time,<br>out of respect for your customers.</p>

  <p>In closing I would like say, that geometry and wire frame,<br>rails into which you slide precious rocks rather than using heat or solder...</p>
  <p>Diamonds, all manner of interesting rocks, famous pieces of glass, and precious bits, micro meteorites, glowing tritium capsules, and fancy crystals...</p>
  <p>All make for beautiful jewelry, but we shouldn't forget history,<br>especially ancient times, as that is where Jewelry had its birth.</p>
  <p>So I suggest, that every once in a while, for every modern piece you create,<br>you recreate an ancient one too.</p>

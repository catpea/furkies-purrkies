    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Diamonds are everywhere,<br>but a uniquely sculpted pendant or ring is rare.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">This is good news for 3D printed jewelry,<br>as it can be shipped directly to the customer.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It just needs a bit of polish,<br>there are no stones to set, no intricate parts to detail.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I highly encourage creating a scared geometry,<br>line of rings, even if just for practice.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Where the stones aren’t so much set,<br>but slid int to the bands or construction.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Cut to size, maybe polished, and encapsulated in a pendant or ring,<br>has a more colorful story to tell, even though it begun, as discarded glass.</div>

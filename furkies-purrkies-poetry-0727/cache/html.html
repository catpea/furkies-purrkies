  <p>Pixels are simple little transparent creatures,<br>and they don't really have many features.</p>
  <p>For one, they have no hair,<br>and are totally square.</p>

  <p>They sure love a good meal,<br>and it is always a big deal.</p>
  <p>For, they eat color to survive,<br>and usually live in a huge hive</p>

  <p>They used to be big and rare,<br>but now they are everywhere.</p>
  <p>And although they got a lot smaller,<br>they never stopped eating color.</p>

  <p>And they love nothing more,<br>than a color you can't ignore.</p>

  <p>Their favorite food however,<br>is a painting in which they can last forever.</p>

  <p>Pixels love sleeping,<br>even if people are always peeping.</p>
  <p>Thus, it should be our preference,<br>that we pick colors directly from our photo reference.</p>

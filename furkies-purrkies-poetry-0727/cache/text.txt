Pixels are simple little transparent creatures,
and they don't really have many features.
For one, they have no hair,
and are totally square.

They sure love a good meal,
and it is always a big deal.
For, they eat color to survive,
and usually live in a huge hive

They used to be big and rare,
but now they are everywhere.
And although they got a lot smaller,
they never stopped eating color.

Since pixels are transparent,
they food they eat is really apparent.
And they love nothing more,
than a color you can't ignore.

In the prehistoric days,
they went through a pretty tough phase.
Back then computers barely had a screen,
and few saw more colors than sixteen.

Pixels like hide and seek,
and they love looking unique.
In the old days pixels had to eat the same food,
and that was, never, good.

Their preferred meal today,
is a good video without any gray.
Their favorite food however,
is a painting in which they can last forever.

Pixels love sleeping,
even if people are always peeping.
Thus, it should be our preference,
that we pick colors directly from our photo reference.

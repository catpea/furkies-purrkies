  "text": "Once pressured for long enough,\nstudents will ask why they need trigonometry if they will never use it.\nFor a student to think that math is useless,\nis to have already been tricked and convinced that they are not smart enough.\nMath is taught so wrong,\nthat children often ask why do I need this.\nSmartphone aside, in their madness teachers respond that,\n\"You won't always have a calculator.\"\n\nOften cunningly, many teachers will attempt to dominate a class,\nby pretending to have a short fuse.\nThey will be taking the shortest path possible,\nthey just want to get paid, put some food on their table and move on.\nThey know their material does not benefit students,\nIt only benefits the test at the end, the finals.\nThe content that finals attempt to test is a mess,\nit is garbage.\n\nStudents in their sanity,\nknow that it is safer to memorize.\nWhat they memorize,\nis certain to be on the test.\nUnlike the things,\nthat they would like to focus on and explore further.\nIf they tried to learn the mix of concepts for real,\nthen they would fail the finals.\nThe class is not about teaching,\nit is just about passing the tests.\n\nThe students know this very well,\nthat is why many just don't care about school or grades.\nIn a world of fake teachers, liars, pretenders, bullies,\nand fake education constantly grading the student down...\nAlcohol and Fighting, Hating and Anger,\nRevenge and Blind Stupidity, start to make sense.\nOnce parents start punishing the so called bad students,\nparents become part of the system that is seemingly attacking them.\n\nOne horrible thing about grades,\nother than the fact that they are unethical, toxic and insane.\nIs that once a person starts getting Cs.\nthey will keep getting Cs from all the other incompetent teachers.\nThe teachers base their grades,\non all the grades in other classes.\nSo if you are a C student in all the other classes,\nbut do really well in your favorite one, you are not going to get straight A's.\n\nTo do mathematics justice,\nstart with simple programming tutorial[1], and move on to a more free hand language[2].\nThen the design and create screen savers, including 3D screen saves[3],\nand pixel-art games[4], at least at first.\nScreen savers are not an outdated invention,\nall the sci-fi screens in movies are basically screen savers.\nComputer games and graphics create a context,\na reason for learning math.\nGames and graphics are flexible enough,\nto capture curiosity of all students so as long as they explore what calls to them.\n\nThe reason schools are broken,\nis that there is no pressure to fix them.\nThere is plenty of pressure to increase the GPA,\nbut nobody cares that Mathematics is learned in a Screen Saver class.\nNobody cares to think about it,\nbecause it is not their problem.\nInstitutions will not check schools based on Screen Saver abilities,\nthere is a top down division of subjects and that is what keeps the schools in business.\nOver time, everything has gravitated towards memorization,\nwhich is acting, a way to pretend to know.\nMultiplication table and order of operations,\nis not an argument for memorization, order of operations or or trigonometric functions need to be understood.\nForcing memorization SOHCAHTOA, is not real education and it is harmful and crazy[5],\nthe students need to understand it for real and in a real setting of a computer game or a screen saver[6].\nBeing tricked into memorization and graduation without ever using trigonometry is fraud,\nthere is no excuse for it.\n\nThe wrong division of subjects,\nthat eliminates real world application in favor of abstract garbage...\nThe forcing students into memorization,\nby tricking them into thinking that they are the ones that made the choice not to understand...\nThe fraud of grades, manipulating them to stay under the radar,\nto keep the teaching job, to keep the school funded...\nParents punishing their children, for not behaving properly in a mad house and a meat processing plant,\nthat cheats them out of real knowledge for the purpose of small paychecks...\n\nIs quite a gamble to make,\nas far as the future of human kind the students that are failing fake educations are certainly not the dunces.\nAnd make no mistake,\nsilence of principals, teachers, and parents, is the same as participation, all parties involved are guilty of fraud.\nAll students are extremely intelligent,\nthe only thing that can stop them from the mastery of technologies that call to them, are parents and teachers.\nIt is a wonder,\nthat the students are listening at all.\nThe betrayal of younger generation, that results in their debt,\nand awful jobs and career choices, that will have extremely negative impact on their mental health, is evil.\nI don't know the word for what happens to the children that the military recruiter manages to lie to,\nin great part because they learned nothing in school.\n\nReal education is not that difficult[7],\nand it makes a world of difference.\nIf education worked correctly,\nthe graduates would co-found start ups together[8] as part of a real graduation.\nRather than school debt,\nthey would start by inventing new things that they could be proud of.\n\nLet us not gamble with the future of Human Kind,\nlet us guide the children to Real Knowledge, Life Changing Wisdom, and the resulting Greatness.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGeT8IyKd2M\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLglp04UYZK_PrN6xWo_nJ-8kzyXDyFUwi\n[3]:

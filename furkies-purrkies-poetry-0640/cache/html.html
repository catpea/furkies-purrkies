  <p>Once pressured for long enough,<br>students will ask why they need trigonometry if they will never use it.</p>
  <p>For a student to think that math is useless,<br>is to have already been tricked and convinced that they are not smart enough.</p>
  <p>Math is taught so wrong,<br>that children often ask why do I need this.</p>
  <p>Smartphone aside, in their madness teachers respond that,<br>"You won't always have a calculator."</p>

  <p>Often cunningly, many teachers will attempt to dominate a class,<br>by pretending to have a short fuse.</p>
  <p>They will be taking the shortest path possible,<br>they just want to get paid, put some food on their table and move on.</p>
  <p>They know their material does not benefit students,<br>It only benefits the test at the end, the finals.</p>
  <p>The content that finals attempt to test is a mess,<br>it is garbage.</p>

  <p>Students in their sanity,<br>know that it is safer to memorize.</p>
  <p>What they memorize,<br>is certain to be on the test.</p>
  <p>Unlike the things,<br>that they would like to focus on and explore further.</p>
  <p>If they tried to learn the mix of concepts for real,<br>then they would fail the finals.</p>
  <p>The class is not about teaching,<br>it is just about passing the tests.</p>

  <p>Alcohol and Fighting, Hating and Anger,<br>Revenge and Blind Stupidity, start to make sense.</p>
  <p>Once parents start punishing the so called bad students,<br>parents become part of the system that is seemingly attacking them.</p>

  <p>One horrible thing about grades,<br>other than the fact that they are unethical, toxic and insane.</p>
  <p>Is that once a person starts getting Cs.<br>they will keep getting Cs from all the other incompetent teachers.</p>
  <p>The teachers base their grades,<br>on all the grades in other classes.</p>
  <p>So if you are a C student in all the other classes,<br>but do really well in your favorite one, you are not going to get straight A's.</p>

  <p>To do mathematics justice,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGeT8IyKd2M">start with simple programming tutorial</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLglp04UYZK_PrN6xWo_nJ-8kzyXDyFUwi">and move on to a more free hand language</a>.</p>
  <p>Then the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upB7CSoxNTs&list=PLbe67PprBSpqM_-HU49fmIS8ncApw4i08">design and create screen savers, including 3D screen saves</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2K4YjBrIW8">and pixel-art games</a>, at least at first.</p>
  <p>Screen savers are not an outdated invention,<br>all the sci-fi screens in movies are basically screen savers.</p>
  <p>Computer games and graphics create a context,<br>a reason for learning math.</p>
  <p>Games and graphics are flexible enough,<br>to capture curiosity of all students so as long as they explore what calls to them.</p>

  <p>The reason schools are broken,<br>is that there is no pressure to fix them.</p>
  <p>There is plenty of pressure to increase the GPA,<br>but nobody cares that Mathematics is learned in a Screen Saver class.</p>
  <p>Nobody cares to think about it,<br>because it is not their problem.</p>
  <p>Institutions will not check schools based on Screen Saver abilities,<br>there is a top down division of subjects and that is what keeps the schools in business.</p>
  <p>Over time, everything has gravitated towards memorization,<br>which is acting, a way to pretend to know.</p>
  <p>Multiplication table and order of operations,<br>is not an argument for memorization, order of operations or or trigonometric functions need to be understood.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu4fulKVv2c">Forcing memorization SOHCAHTOA, is not real education and it is harmful and crazy</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovLbCvq7FNA">the students need to understand it for real and in a real setting of a computer game or a screen saver</a>.</p>
  <p>Being tricked into memorization and graduation without ever using trigonometry is fraud,<br>there is no excuse for it.</p>

  <p>Is quite a gamble to make,<br>as far as the future of human kind the students that are failing fake educations are certainly not the dunces.</p>
  <p>And make no mistake,<br>silence of principals, teachers, and parents, is the same as participation, all parties involved are guilty of fraud.</p>
  <p>All students are extremely intelligent,<br>the only thing that can stop them from the mastery of technologies that call to them, are parents and teachers.</p>
  <p>It is a wonder,<br>that the students are listening at all.</p>
  <p>The betrayal of younger generation, that results in their debt,<br>and awful jobs and career choices, that will have extremely negative impact on their mental health, is evil.</p>
  <p>I don't know the word for what happens to the children that the military recruiter manages to lie to,<br>in great part because they learned nothing in school.</p>

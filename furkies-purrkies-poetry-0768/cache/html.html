  <p>The creation of an expensive series of paintings,<br>is a multi-step process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">

<div class="section">
  <p>It begins with creation of a theme,<br>for a series of four or nine paintings.</p>
  <p>Then photo-manipulating and photo-bashing prototypes together,<br>or the creation of an advanced digital-photo-based sketch.</p>
  <p>Then using this photo manipulated image,<br>as direct reference, the perfect source of correct color and shape.</p>
  <p>And it ends with the creation of either a single copy of the paining,<br>or a limited number of copies, 500 hundred for example.</p>
  <p>This final step requires the creation of a custom frame,<br>that matches the theme of the series.</p>
  <p>And the canvas it self should take advantage,<br>of the painting being digital, and containing multiple layers.</p>
  <p>Don't just flatten everything,<br>use the options digital painting offers to create something new.</p>
  <p>Printing on multiple panes of glass,<br>to create depth is one such idea.</p>
  <p>However you print it,<br>print it out with microscopic precision.</p>
  <p>To make it even more,<br>fascinating to look at.</p>

  <p>It must be a smooth process,<br>from start to finish.</p>
  <p>That is why you work everything out<br>in the initial photo-bashing session.</p>
  <p>This is important, because eventually,<br>you will be working with client’s faces.</p>
  <p>An high priced paintings,<br>means that there is no room for imperfections.</p>

  <p>But the most important thing,<br>is that you never go to sleep frustrated.</p>
  <p>That you always,<br>have a successful painting session.</p>
  <p>This is why you should use that advanced reference technique,<br>and photo realistic sketch.</p>

  <p>Selling art, especially if you choose to work with deadlines,<br>has the power to take happiness away from art.</p>
  <p>The world is being choked by poverty,<br>because politicians don't know how to upgrade the concept of money...</p>
  <p>And turn it into something that helps humanity,<br>and not holds it back.</p>
  <p>This enormous error will trickle down,<br>into your art.</p>
  <p>For example when the money from the next series of nine paintings,<br>can pay for a home, or medical care, or something that makes life safer.</p>
  <p>Having that advanced reference sketch,<br>will always keep you moving forward.</p>
  <p>All the while constantly teaching you new things,<br>and training your artistic abilities.</p>

  <p>It is also up to your imagination to tie the series of paintings together,<br>put them in a futuristic, prehistoric, comedy-horror, or a marshmallow universe.</p>
  <p>Look at books at the library, art books at the book store,<br>browse some movies, lookup cartoons - find a common theme.</p>
  <p>If you choose Pop Surrealism, know that despite all the chaos,<br>it all comes together in its title.</p>
  <p>Which you can find in lists of <a href="https://html.duckduckgo.com/html?q=Catchy%20School%20Slogans%2C%20Taglines%20and%20Mottos">Catchy School Slogans</a><br>or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_university_and_college_mottos">List of university and college mottos</a> which are often in Greek or fancy and barbaric Latin.</p>

  <p>They won't sell at first,<br>but every gallery has an empty wall.</p>
  <p>Use something as powerful as multi-creature Pop Surrealism,<br>to shock the gallery into asking.</p>
  <p>"Why in the doodle...<br>is your art not on our wall?"</p>

  <p>Finally, I once saw a person open two windows,<br>in one he divided his image into a grid, and in the other he started copying by hand.</p>
  <p>It was very painful to watch,<br>because he got tricked by crappy teachers and their lectures.</p>
  <p>And probably became scared by being shamed by his friends,<br>who also got tricked by fake art education.</p>

  <p>Know this, digital painting,<br>is not an alternative to traditional painting.</p>
  <p>It is an upgrade to painting,<br>and it is a superpower.</p>

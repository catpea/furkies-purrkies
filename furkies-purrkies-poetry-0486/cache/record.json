  "text": "There is no such thing as preparations for adventure,\nbecause adventure is not something external.\nIf you are not packed already,\nalways ready as a matter of daily routine.\nThen all you need to pack,\nis all the curiosities already in your purse and whatever you have in your pockets.\n\nIt is not true that adventure requires driving,\nbut if that is what the heart wishes for, then allow me to explain.\nAdventurers like simple roads,\nhighway by highway they take them to the end.\nEventually the highways end,\nand there is always a town.\nAnd you guessed it, it is full of strange creatures,\nand often refereed to as the end of the road town.\nIn my case it was Florida Keys,\n75 South and then US-1, it always takes a few days.\n\nI think the first few adventure are the longest,\nlater you only do the things you like.\nI took to bicycling, never too far, and not always,\njust on interesting days when there is nothing going on.\nMy bicycle is always ready,\nalways waiting by the door, I don't even put it in the garage.\nI just grab a bottle of water,\nand skatoosh.\n\nI go as far as the nearest interesting thing,\nand as slow, as one could possibly go.\nMy adventure path runs by a noisy highway,\nbut I just grab a pair of ear plugs, no problemo.\nI bought a proper mudguard fender this year,\nso I like to investigate the trails after it rains in some unusual way, cloudy weather can be just as nice as sunny.\nIt is really important to take photos,\nas many as you can snap, will do; you can sort them out later, and make a safe backup.\n\nAll adventures need something to ponder about,\nfor example I am just about to go on a tiny, bicycle adventure myself.\nAnd I set the aim,\nto be about helping people structure poetry.\nAnd I already have something extremely important to share,\nall interesting poems need an equally interesting package.\nI actually became aware of this as a little boy watching Indiana Jones movies,\nthe way the whole move seemed to change when he flew across an ocean is what made those movies so interesting.\n\nWhile we are talking about adventure,\nwe are using the adventure to teach about poetry.\nNot all people are interested in tiny adventures,\nlikewise not all people are interested in little poems.\nBut, I think most people will find something curious,\nas we move from one to the other.\nProper poetry wants you to pay attention to the rhythm of your words,\nand ensure that the rhymes come in predictable places, this is very similar to music.\n\nIn this adventure poetry tutorial, I will show you how to write less strict, a more open type of rhyme,\nthis flexibility will allow the message behind your poem to stay clear, and mostly understandable.\nIf you have never used a rhyming dictionary[1] before,\nyou can just search the web for it, and use an on-line one.\nSo we are going to write two lines of text, the first one can be long-ish and must end with a word that has rhymes,\nand the second one should be shorter as to quickly end with the rhyming word.\nAs you read them, and I think all poems should be recorded as audio by their authors,\ntry to somewhat speed through the second line to get to the rhyming word as quickly as possible.\n\nA neat and tidy poem should have between nine and twelve, maybe sixteen such creations,\nbut it is up to you, it depends on how much you have to say.\nSo, first line can be long, that where you say something meaningful,\nbut end it with a word that has rhymes.\nTo write the second shorter line, you have to go through the words that rhyme with the last word in the long line,\nand add a short relevant sub-statement that strengthens your first line.\nSometimes you may need to change the first line to end on a better word,\nto make the second line easier to write, oh, and short and simple words are usually the ones that have nicest rhymes.\n\nLet me show you a simple example poem,\nthat uses this approach.\n\nAs bicycling goes, cloudy weather can be just as nice as sunny,\neven if the clouds look a little funny.\nBut yes it will probably rain a little bit,\nbut it is still worth it.\nFor one it makes for an amazing bicycle-selfie photo op,\nand you don't even have to stop.\nWhen you get home you can show everyone what a mighty adventurer you are,\nand become a superstar.\n\nSo here I stretched my own rule and used only four stanzas,\njust to keep it simple.\nEach line took about two tries to get it right,\nI really wanted to rhyme sunny with bunny, but it made the line way too long.\nYou can think of that as an invitation to the second part of the poem,\nwhere you talk about the friends you made along the way.\nI saw a frog or an otter, angry birds that were just about to swoop down to peck me[2],\nand about five maybe seven bunnies, including a really tiny one.\n\nIn closing, I want to underscore,\nhow important it is to wrap your poem in another poem, or story to make it more interesting.\nAnd bring to your attention that this poem was so sweet an simple,\nbecause I lived it, I was there, my shirt got wet, I talked at the bunnies to keep them from being scared...\nI even ended up with rain, on the inside of my bug eye-protection glasses,\nI had to stop to wipe it off.\nA colorful poem is easiest to write,\nwhen you were actually there, in the middle of the story.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.google.com/search?q=rhyming+dictionary\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWGiWHwmhhc",

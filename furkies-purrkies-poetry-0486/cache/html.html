  <p>There is no such thing as preparations for adventure,<br>because adventure is not something external.</p>
  <p>If you are not packed already,<br>always ready as a matter of daily routine.</p>
  <p>Then all you need to pack,<br>is all the curiosities already in your purse and whatever you have in your pockets.</p>

  <p>It is not true that adventure requires driving,<br>but if that is what the heart wishes for, then allow me to explain.</p>
  <p>Adventurers like simple roads,<br>highway by highway they take them to the end.</p>
  <p>Eventually the highways end,<br>and there is always a town.</p>
  <p>And you guessed it, it is full of strange creatures,<br>and often refereed to as the end of the road town.</p>
  <p>In my case it was Florida Keys,<br>75 South and then US-1, it always takes a few days.</p>

  <p>I think the first few adventure are the longest,<br>later you only do the things you like.</p>
  <p>I took to bicycling, never too far, and not always,<br>just on interesting days when there is nothing going on.</p>
  <p>My bicycle is always ready,<br>always waiting by the door, I don't even put it in the garage.</p>
  <p>I just grab a bottle of water,<br>and skatoosh.</p>

  <p>I go as far as the nearest interesting thing,<br>and as slow, as one could possibly go.</p>
  <p>My adventure path runs by a noisy highway,<br>but I just grab a pair of ear plugs, no problemo.</p>
  <p>I bought a proper mudguard fender this year,<br>so I like to investigate the trails after it rains in some unusual way, cloudy weather can be just as nice as sunny.</p>
  <p>It is really important to take photos,<br>as many as you can snap, will do; you can sort them out later, and make a safe backup.</p>

  <p>All adventures need something to ponder about,<br>for example I am just about to go on a tiny, bicycle adventure myself.</p>
  <p>And I set the aim,<br>to be about helping people structure poetry.</p>
  <p>And I already have something extremely important to share,<br>all interesting poems need an equally interesting package.</p>
  <p>I actually became aware of this as a little boy watching Indiana Jones movies,<br>the way the whole move seemed to change when he flew across an ocean is what made those movies so interesting.</p>

  <p>While we are talking about adventure,<br>we are using the adventure to teach about poetry.</p>
  <p>Not all people are interested in tiny adventures,<br>likewise not all people are interested in little poems.</p>
  <p>But, I think most people will find something curious,<br>as we move from one to the other.</p>
  <p>Proper poetry wants you to pay attention to the rhythm of your words,<br>and ensure that the rhymes come in predictable places, this is very similar to music.</p>

  <p>In this adventure poetry tutorial, I will show you how to write less strict, a more open type of rhyme,<br>this flexibility will allow the message behind your poem to stay clear, and mostly understandable.</p>
  <p>If you have never used a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rhyming+dictionary">rhyming dictionary</a> before,<br>you can just search the web for it, and use an on-line one.</p>
  <p>So we are going to write two lines of text, the first one can be long-ish and must end with a word that has rhymes,<br>and the second one should be shorter as to quickly end with the rhyming word.</p>
  <p>As you read them, and I think all poems should be recorded as audio by their authors,<br>try to somewhat speed through the second line to get to the rhyming word as quickly as possible.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>A neat and tidy poem should have between nine and twelve, maybe sixteen such creations,<br>but it is up to you, it depends on how much you have to say.</p>
  <p>So, first line can be long, that where you say something meaningful,<br>but end it with a word that has rhymes.</p>
  <p>To write the second shorter line, you have to go through the words that rhyme with the last word in the long line,<br>and add a short relevant sub-statement that strengthens your first line.</p>
  <p>Sometimes you may need to change the first line to end on a better word,<br>to make the second line easier to write, oh, and short and simple words are usually the ones that have nicest rhymes.</p>

  <p>Let me show you a simple example poem,<br>that uses this approach.</p>

  <p>As bicycling goes, cloudy weather can be just as nice as sunny,<br>even if the clouds look a little funny.</p>
  <p>But yes it will probably rain a little bit,<br>but it is still worth it.</p>
  <p>For one it makes for an amazing bicycle-selfie photo op,<br>and you don't even have to stop.</p>
  <p>When you get home you can show everyone what a mighty adventurer you are,<br>and become a superstar.</p>

  <p>So here I stretched my own rule and used only four stanzas,<br>just to keep it simple.</p>
  <p>Each line took about two tries to get it right,<br>I really wanted to rhyme sunny with bunny, but it made the line way too long.</p>
  <p>You can think of that as an invitation to the second part of the poem,<br>where you talk about the friends you made along the way.</p>
  <p>I saw a frog or an otter, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWGiWHwmhhc">angry birds that were just about to swoop down to peck me</a>,<br>and about five maybe seven bunnies, including a really tiny one.</p>

  <p>In closing, I want to underscore,<br>how important it is to wrap your poem in another poem, or story to make it more interesting.</p>
  <p>And bring to your attention that this poem was so sweet an simple,<br>because I lived it, I was there, my shirt got wet, I talked at the bunnies to keep them from being scared...</p>
  <p>I even ended up with rain, on the inside of my bug eye-protection glasses,<br>I had to stop to wipe it off.</p>
  <p>A colorful poem is easiest to write,<br>when you were actually there, in the middle of the story.</p>

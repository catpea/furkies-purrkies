This is all between you
and me...
The first time I saw the sea,
I muttered "are you freaking kidding me"
I didn't speak English yet,
but we all have a way of saying it.
I felt betrayed,
that this experience was delayed.
I was only about eight or so,
I was pretty smart, though.
At first glance I knew with certainty,
that I was the, son of the sea.
I remember walking the longest the peer,
with a grin and not a hint of fear.
Oh, and I remember the Baltic Sea; food,
being extremely good.
The flounders on a pointy stick
were always extra salty and thick.
I have since visited the Atlantic Ocean,
even used a sandy New York Subway for locomotion.
And found that I must do what it takes,
to live within a driving distance to Great Lakes.
Now, each year I cheerfully await Spring,
so that I may hear Seagulls sing.
Sometimes I even buy sea shells at a local store,
to secretly scatter them at the lake Michigan shore.
I call it it the varnished treasure,
and it never fails to make tourists happy beyond measure.

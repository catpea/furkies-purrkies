    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The first time I saw the sea,<br>I muttered "are you freaking kidding me"</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I didn't speak English yet,<br>but we all have a way of saying it.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I felt betrayed,<br>that this experience was delayed.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I was only about eight or so,<br>I was pretty smart, though.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">At first glance I knew with certainty,<br>that I was the, son of the sea.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I remember walking the longest the peer,<br>with a grin and not a hint of fear.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And found that I must do what it takes,<br>to live within a driving distance to Great Lakes.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Now, each year I cheerfully await Spring,<br>so that I may hear Seagulls sing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Sometimes I even buy sea shells at a local store,<br>to secretly scatter them at the lake Michigan shore.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I call it it the varnished treasure,<br>and it never fails to make tourists happy beyond measure.</div>

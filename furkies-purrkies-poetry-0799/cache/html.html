  <p>This is all between you<br>and me...</p>
  <p>The first time I saw the sea,<br>I muttered "are you freaking kidding me"</p>
  <p>I didn't speak English yet,<br>but we all have a way of saying it.</p>
  <p>I felt betrayed,<br>that this experience was delayed.</p>
  <p>I was only about eight or so,<br>I was pretty smart, though.</p>
  <p>At first glance I knew with certainty,<br>that I was the, son of the sea.</p>
  <p>I remember walking the longest the peer,<br>with a grin and not a hint of fear.</p>
  <p>Oh, and I remember the Baltic Sea; food,<br>being extremely good.</p>
  <p>The flounders on a pointy stick<br>were always extra salty and thick.</p>
  <p>I have since visited the Atlantic Ocean,<br>even used a sandy New York Subway for locomotion.</p>
  <p>And found that I must do what it takes,<br>to live within a driving distance to Great Lakes.</p>
  <p>Now, each year I cheerfully await Spring,<br>so that I may hear Seagulls sing.</p>
  <p>Sometimes I even buy sea shells at a local store,<br>to secretly scatter them at the lake Michigan shore.</p>
  <p>I call it it the varnished treasure,<br>and it never fails to make tourists happy beyond measure.</p>

  <p>All the complicated things,<br>are easy when broken all the way down.</p>
  <p>Digital painting is easy,<br>as you stop trying to finish the painting...</p>
  <p>And instead,<br>focus on the steps in the process.</p>
  <p>Each step can be done well or badly,<br>doing something badly does not guarantee predictable results.</p>
  <p>But doing the steps well,<br>will sometimes even surprise you with the result.</p>
  <p>For example,<br>pick your reference photo... well.</p>
  <p>If you pick a blurry reference photo,<br>you may have trouble shaping the eye.</p>
  <p>And as a result,<br>the final painting will be off.</p>
  <p>In which case,<br>you hare to begin reforming the process.</p>
  <p>Peer pressure where someone is scared,<br>of other artists saying “This is not art, your technique is fraud.”</p>
  <p>Absolutely needs to be handled well,<br>because such an evil thing can destroy an artist.</p>
  <p>In this instance, you need to understand,<br>that this person is a destroyer of art and artists.</p>
  <p>They destroy others,<br>to make themselves feel special.</p>
  <p>The technique that you choose is sacred,<br>it is to be celebrated.</p>
  <p>As you grow and flourish as an artist,<br>so will your techniques go through countless transformations.</p>
  <p>Art and Computer Programming,<br>are good friends because programming is step oriented.</p>
  <p>No one dares to sit down to finish their program,<br>before going through the different steps to be able to do it well.</p>
  <p>In that way, Computer Programming,<br>teaches that there are well defined steps that must be taken in art as well.</p>
  <p>Once you are looking for them, it takes no time at all,<br>to figure out where the seams in the process of another artist are.</p>
  <p>Watch a few artists paint,<br>or talk about their painting process.</p>
  <p>And you will synthesize your own,<br>set of steps.</p>

  <p>Is it always steps?<br>Yes - no child has ever been born predisposed to be great at graffiti, digital art, or church music.</p>
  <p>But you can see, how creating such a myth,<br>would help to sell their works.</p>
  <p>But after a while an artist or programmer,<br>will round everything off into a nearly seamless whole.</p>
  <p>But it is always steps,<br>and an expert always aims for a proper measure of excellence at each step.</p>
  <p>And after just a little while, it always becomes a unique process,<br>because as each artist grows, they refine and emphasize different steps, and take to unique directions.</p>

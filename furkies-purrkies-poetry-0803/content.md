All the complicated things,
are easy when broken all the way down.

Digital painting is easy,
as you stop trying to finish the painting...

And instead,
focus on the steps in the process.

Each step can be done well or badly,
doing something badly does not guarantee predictable results.

But doing the steps     well,
will sometimes even surprise you with the result.

For example,
pick your reference photo... well.

If you pick a blurry reference photo,
you may have trouble shaping the eye.

And as a result,
the final painting will be off.

In which case,
you hare to begin reforming the process.

Peer pressure where someone is scared,
of other artists saying “This is not art, your technique is fraud.”

Absolutely needs to be handled well,
because such an evil thing can destroy an artist.

In this instance, you need to understand,
that this person is a destroyer of art and artists.

They destroy others,
to make themselves feel special.

The technique that you choose is sacred,
it is to be celebrated.

As you grow and flourish as an artist,
so will your techniques go through countless transformations.

Art and Computer Programming,
are good friends because programming is step oriented.

No one dares to sit down to finish their program,
before going through the different steps to be able to do it well.

In that way, Computer Programming,
teaches that there are well defined   steps that must be taken in art as well.

Once you are looking for them, it takes no time at all,
to figure out where the seams in the process of another artist are.

Watch a few artists paint,
or talk about their painting process.

And you will synthesize your own,
set of steps.

Is it always steps?
Yes - no child has ever been born predisposed to be great at graffiti, digital art, or church music.

But you can see, how creating such a myth,
would help to sell their works.

But after a while an artist or programmer,
will round everything off into a nearly seamless whole.

But it is always steps,
and an expert always aims for a proper measure of excellence at each step.

And after just a little while, it always becomes a unique process,
because as each artist grows, they refine and emphasize different steps, and take to unique directions.

  <p>Not all art sessions,<br>take lots of preparation.</p>
  <p>Creating digital ink sketches,<br>takes a minute per sketch.</p>
  <p>Line art can be just as magical,<br>as impressionism.</p>
  <p>There is nothing to stop line art<br>from perfectly capturing a face.</p>

  <p>And discovering just the right background colors,<br>to match the weather is wonderful.</p>

  <p>An you know what, you almost certainly,<br>are going to need a bicycle.</p>
  <p>The simpler the better,<br>and fat tire ones are very stable.</p>
  <p>Get a camera,<br>perhaps with a wide angle lens.</p>
  <p>Or clip-on lenses for your phone,<br>though a dedicated camera is best, somehow.</p>

  <p>A couple bits of charcoal<br>and a mean stick or two.</p>

  <p>It is a little know fact,<br>but picnics are a huge part of being an artist.</p>
  <p>You always,<br>see a painter by his canvas.</p>

  <p>Let me tell you,<br>it's a picnic.</p>
  <p>Biscuits,<br>and everything.</p>

  <p>Be careful,<br>of cloudy days.</p>
  <p>Even great portrait photos taken on cloudy days,<br>may end up feeling flat.</p>
  <p>Though adding sun to a cloudy day photo,<br>is a great way to learn more about painting.</p>
  <p>Make it a two day adventure,<br>instead of canceling one altogether.</p>
  <p>And make sure there are good shadows<br>and strong highlights in your photos.</p>
  <p>Those make a world of difference in a painting,<br>deepest dark and brightest light do most of the talking.</p>

  <p>When ready, open up Krita,<br>use the Reference Images Tool.</p>
  <p>Stretch your reference over the entire canvas, set it to 50% opacity.<br>and use it as a shape and color guide.</p>

  <p>While it is hard to see in a photo,<br>every painting has its own atmosphere.</p>
  <p>Facial expression, temperature,<br>horizon and space.</p>
  <p>And even detail like a thin sun highlight,<br>on the side of a face...</p>
  <p>And whether or not you blur the background,<br>to focus sharper on the face.</p>
  <p>Create a new world,<br>a world that has not yet existed.</p>
  <p>Every one of your paintings,<br>will come with its own mystery.</p>

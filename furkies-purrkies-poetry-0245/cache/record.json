  "text": "Myths were invented to describe amazing people,\nand I've seen many amazing creatures in my journeys.\n\nOne time out in Nordhouse,\nout of nowhere popped out a freshly graduated engineer.\nHe held up a gallon water container that was carrying back to camp,\nand the poor mad lad uttered, \"8.34 pounds\".\nHe seemed excited, but also sad,\nand I think he was acting so odd because he realized he was forgetting everything.\nPlus, I am certain he said pounds,\nnot kilograms; mad in deed.\n\nAnother time, at 6am or so, I was going through maps of south Pacific,\nin Ann Arbor, by that strange black metal cube sculpture that squeaks when rotated.\nI just had to get away from Ambrosia's morning clientele,\nbless their hearts.\nAnd I've noticed that across the park some student was sleeping under an evergreen,\nI don't think she worked in US, I just somehow assumed South America, Amazon.\nShe stared getting off the ground, and tried to yell that she wasn't homeless or drunk,\nI kept looking into my maps, ignoring her; and she went on her way to get a grant, or give a speech or something.\nI am sure she worked in South America,\nprobably with the natives.\n\nOver in Ludington, there was this one time a little girl was feeding Seagulls with her mom,\nand just as I noticed the commotion...\none of the Seagulls,\nwent, all, out!\nRight in her hair,\nI felt so bad, and her mother was only barely able to contain her laughter.\nShe puffed up her face as if playing a trumpet,\nyou could totally tell she had enough of that kid, and she was getting payback for all her hissy fits.\n\nAnd then there is this... story that is most Dearest to me,\none of my happiest memories, that I swore I would never talk about because I am far too mature.\nAlas, this is what All Hallows' Eve is all about,\ntalking about strange creatures, and wonderful memories.\nIt was an beautiful early morning,\nI was sitting by my breakfast fire.\nMostly listening to birds, and probably angry bears,\nwhilst squiggling in my journal, about poems, and programs.\nThis was a large and beautiful camp site full of tress,\nthey had clean showers, and proper restrooms.\nI had the first camp site on the Orchid Loop[1],\nand I noticed that a couple of giggly middle aged ladies were just getting into the spirit of camping[2].\nThey were always happy, and sophisticated,\nand laughing, playing some smart radio station, and always full of joy.\nThis morning the tall one started shimmy shammying first,\nshe was probably getting around to starting up a fire to make breakfast.\nThey had all the firewood,\nand swe was singing something, it was unusual for people to make so many happy little noises during a stay there.\nShe quieted down a bit,\nand lit her fire.\nAnd as she bent over to pick up some twigs to get things going,\nshe fired off that old familiar sound that one would expect from a constipated and uncultured, filthy, lactose intolerant old man.\nAnd, oh my gosh,\nall of a sudden all the birds went quiet.\nIt was just this unusual deafening silence,\nand that's just half the story, because all of a sudden this sophisticated wealthy woman goes:\n\n\"PUULL MY FINGA\"\n\nIn the worst fake southern accent she could possibly conjure up,\nand with the longest drawl.\nAnd then she quickly skedaddled back to her camper,\n- probably to change, and lay down a bit.\nThis must have been ten years ago or more,\nand I still haven't forgotten about it.\n\nHappy Halloween,\nEveryone.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://goo.gl/maps/hEuvinvxzRRPLj7y7\n[2]: https://goo.gl/maps/qR39FpAkVJ5azPZQ6",

  "text": "If I only had to say one thing about it,\nI'd say:\n\"You create a tiny product by putting in a tiny amount of effort.\"\nHow tiny?,\nMy smallest product,\nwas 6x4 pixels small.\nI generated my own color swatches[1] via the HSL Color Model[2]\nrandomly colored my some of my pixels, and then re-sized my little 6x4 creation to 4K (3840 Ã— 2160).\nI resized it using ImageMagick[3],\nwhich by default will blur the end result to create a beautifully smooth background.\nI uploaded them to Creative Market[4] as 4K Desktop Backgrounds,\nand a made $60 in sales, before I shut the experiment down.\nI had another $60 there already,\nfrom a much more complex product.\nOne that took months, and generated 30,000 Bootstrap Card[5] designs, and had a variation that was connected to Stripe[6].\n(Bootstrap[7] helps with Graphic User Interface design, and Stripe is a Payment Processing Gateway)\nI fully embrace failure in my product design,\nI almost want it, because that is the best way to learn.\nMake your products small and beautiful,\nand learn from your failures.\nI classified my computer creations as Minimum Viable Products[8],\nand I continue my search for tiny and valuable things, I am currently looking at automatically generating dance and workout music.\n\nIf you don't like computers,\nthen that maybe even better.\nAdam Savage of Myth Busters fame has a small video about hand made products[9],\nin which he mentions markets like Etsy[10].\nHand made does not mean hard work,\nyou kind of probably should sell products that are not yet assembled - so product kits.\nYou can manufacture them by looking around for a local business that will help you machine parts,\nor online where you can 3D print prototypes or laser cut leather, or wood, or acrylic, with Shapeways[11] and Ponoko[12]\nYou can also find a Maker Space[13],\nwhere you maybe able to find the tools and advice you need.\n\nI know that selling cute wooden charms[14] is not a way to build a business,\nbut holding your first product in your hands is a very educational experience, and money well spent.\nPlus, you get a new item for your design portfolio,\nwhere you can beautifully feature your diagrams, sketches, and ideas.\nYour earliest products,\nare priceless, in 30 years as you look through your portfolio your silly wooden charms will make you very proud[15].\nThe distance to a good product from a silly little charm,\nis actually just a few more sketches, and a CNC & Laser Cutter shop where you can design a range of pricey wallets[16].\nOr, wallet kits, where you ship a futuristic wallet along with a little screwdriver and shiny brass screws,\nallowing the customer to customize it during the final assembly.\nThink of it as outsourcing your assembly to the customer,\nand passing on the savings.\nAnd if you prefer more modern technology,\nthen design a range of cases for the Raspberry PI[17], here it makes even greater sense to ship it as a kit, and of course you don't need to include the Raspberry PI[18].\n\nJust accept failure as part of progress,\nand focus on design a range of very interesting products, for three reasons.\nLearning the work flow, beginning with customer interest,\nonward to sales, and getting a nice review, or rating.\nLearning from failure,\nor you can call it: slowly seeking a path to success.\nAnd filling your portfolio with beautiful sketches and prototypes,\ndocumenting your path to success, and later on publishing your Design Portfolio as an actual book that people all over the world can use for inspiration.\nIt is better to start slowly a little bit at a time,\nfocus on creating miniature side-businesses first, enjoy the product design, and leave nothing out of your portfolio.\nÂ \nReferences\n[1]: https://colorhunt.co/\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAw2_NtGNaA\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy_2Dncb26s\n[4]: https://creativemarket.com/\n[5]: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XKRxeo9414\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7CfaDYzTVM\n[8]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmfC-i9WgH0\n[9]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZZlEbttaO0\n[10]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UISLd3-KN8\n[11]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaxwSVr3cl8\n[12]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOTUw6Iz2GY\n[13]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wti6FMvDAE4\n[14]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOTUw6Iz2GY\n[15]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex2ALzWigB8\n[16]: https://www.trayvax.com/\n[17]: https://www.etsy.com/search?q=Raspberry+PI+Case\n[18]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKPobkb1N6o&t=20",

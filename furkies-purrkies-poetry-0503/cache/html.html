  <p>We have this silly flaw of believing most things,<br>and this really small curse of underestimating ourselves - I don't know why - but here is how to get rid of both.</p>
  <p>Above all, All Human Beings are Infinite, and Mighty,<br>and a lot smarter than they will ever know.</p>
  <p>Infinity, means that only liars fall to pieces,<br>healthy humans that follow their curiosity have no reason to fall apart, they love life.</p>
  <p>So as long as we are authentic, we are mighty,<br>who could possibly lose their strength in the middle of their beautiful journey.</p>
  <p>And the reason why many people are easily tricked into thinking they are not smart,<br>is because they've been taught falsehoods, or things were kept from them; or warped for them;</p>
  <p>Plus, even when a person isn't mislead, they may imagine smarts, intelligence, intellect, brains,<br>as an object that one must carry around and have ready at all times, they forget there is this thing called learning.</p>
  <p>To make things simple, I would redefine intelligence,<br>as ability to learn things that we want to know.</p>
  <p>We learn about things that we are passionate about so quickly,<br>that it almost doesn't matter what we know.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>The silly flaw is that we accept almost everything, without question,<br>it is probably how liars get around, it certainly is the road that cults travel.</p>
  <p>The first thing that we should learn in Science Class is:<br>"Question Everything".</p>
  <p>It is just two words, a wisdom reduced to perfection,<br>by scientific minds.</p>
  <p>And I know that there are real profe4ssors out there that make questioning into homework,<br>and ask the students to make a short list of all the things they questioned - and just entertain themselves.</p>
  <p>And there is always that student, that picks one of the big religions, and goes,<br>"If an international business can be build on foundation of fantasy, war, and torture... Why should we take smaller organizations like this school for granted."</p>
  <p>...And the professor, walks up to her, bows,<br>and hands her... a freaking... brand new iPad.</p>
  <p>Or something.</p>

<div class="section">
  <p>But you get the point, our flaw is fixed by two words,<br><strong>Question Everything</strong>.</p>
  <p>Question grades, poverty, and wars,<br>question politicians.</p>
  <p>And while you're at it, ask yourself,<br>if there is anything other than war, weapons, and disease that has ever enriched a nation.</p>
  <p>That is an important question for this century,<br>this century will be the beginning of us rebuilding how a Human Life should be lived.</p>
  <p>Even-companies that profit from violating peoples privacy, even! if the users have signed it away,<br>will get it, this kind of feeding on unsuspecting users that just want to share some photos, will unravel even the biggest companies.</p>
  <p>Stuff like weapons manufacturing, even if they proclaim to have merely followed orders,<br>will all come undone.</p>
  <p>We are just learning more,<br>people are growing up more informed.</p>
  <p>All the political pretenders and lairs,<br>the multi-faced leaders are exposed, they count on noise and ignorance - but that only exists in their own heads.</p>

  <p>And then there is the small curse,<br>which is that we are somehow cursed to underestimate ourselves.</p>
  <p>No one ever feels as smart as they really are,<br>as beautiful as they truly are.</p>
  <p>Here the solution is somewhat more complex,<br>though still has a two word "thing".</p>
  <p>And the two words that you have to remember are:<br><strong>Beautiful Opposite</strong>.</p>
  <p>Because we have to find the beautiful opposite,<br>of what we suspect is this terrible thing that we have, and can't ever fix, and everybody else can, but we can't, ever, whatever... is.</p>
  <p>And this is tough, because for example, if someone swears they are ugly,<br>not only do they have to identify that this them underestimating themselves, but they have to do the Beautiful Opposite.</p>

  <p>It is all different for all,<br>if a heavy person feels ugly, then they have to realize they have lived for decades while wearing a Weight Vest, something that bodybuilders can only dream of.</p>
  <p>Meaning, that when they finally find their beauty and slow down with exercise,<br>they will also be very muscular.</p>
  <p>And more importantly, not do they become beautiful bodybuilders,<br>but also add 50 years to their life, if not more.</p>
  <p>And they will have a natural instinct to walk the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug">Appalachian Trail</a>,<br>something that people who aren't overweight have to really work on.</p>
  <p>Some may become adventurers that prefer smaller trails, with more curiosities on them,<br>others may take to ripping all their kitchen appliances out with great fanfare and triumph, and start dancing to hip-hop, maybe.</p>

  <p>Question Everything, and Beautiful Opposite,<br>are the cure for our troubles.</p>
  <p>In my experience <strong>Question Everything</strong> sends us drifting towards Beautifully Narrated Books,<br>and <strong>Beautiful Opposite</strong>, actually sends us on adventures.</p>
  <p>So in this way, this Flaw of Indoctrination, and Curse of Underestimation,<br>is a kind of a launchpad, for greater things.</p>
  <p>So as long as we remember those four words,<br>we are neither flawed, nor cursed.</p>
  <p>And what is more, we are well on our way towards great adventures,<br>and the constant transcendence of our limits onward to becoming Great Beings.</p>

one person is moved by Museums,another may get really bored by going there every week.\nBeing a parent is tough,Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva comes to mind.\nI love how she used to say that children should appreciate: the gift of words on paper,she knew, she learned from books on her own, so she knew about inheriting knowledge from great beings.\nDimitri got in to the school,the same year she passed away from tuberculosis.\nLet me just add that Dimitri had bad grades in the Classics, Latin and German,but he did well in mathematics, physics and the sciences.\nAbstract thinking,figures.\n\nBut no one, no matter how little,can ask for what Maria did.\nEven when we are little,we have to stand up for growing up, largely on our own, we have to make big plans.\n\nIt is

when one person is moved by Museums,\nanother may get really bored by going there every week.\nBeing a parent is tough,\nMaria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva comes to mind.\nI love how she used to say that children should appreciate: the gift of words on paper,\nshe knew, she learned from books on her own, so she knew about inheriting knowledge from great beings.\nDimitri[1] got in to the school,\nthe same year she passed away from tuberculosis.\nLet me just add that Dimitri had bad grades in the Classics, Latin and German,\nbut he did well in mathematics, physics and the sciences.\nAbstract thinking,\nfigures.\n\nBut no one, no matter how little,\ncan ask for what Maria did.\nEven when we are little,\nwe have to stand up for growing up, largely on our own, we have to make big

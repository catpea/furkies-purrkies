  <p>Uninterrupted Growing Up is a big deal for our minds as we grow,<br>but it is also very difficult to everyone around us.</p>
  <p>For one the world is poor,<br>everyone is tired and stressed out.</p>
  <p>And when one person is moved by Museums,<br>another may get really bored by going there every week.</p>
  <p>Being a parent is tough,<br>Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva comes to mind.</p>
  <p>I love how she used to say that children should appreciate: the gift of words on paper,<br>she knew, she learned from books on her own, so she knew about inheriting knowledge from great beings.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPnwBITSmgU">Dimitri</a> got in to the school,<br>the same year she passed away from tuberculosis.</p>
  <p>Let me just add that Dimitri had bad grades in the Classics, Latin and German,<br>but he did well in mathematics, physics and the sciences.</p>
  <p>Abstract thinking,<br>figures.</p>

  <p>But no one, no matter how little,<br>can ask for what Maria did.</p>
  <p>Even when we are little,<br>we have to stand up for growing up, largely on our own, we have to make big plans.</p>

  <p>It is when we are little that we can really easily narrow down our interests,<br>I was curious about the stars, I remember writing a short thing about the Kosmos.</p>
  <p>And I had a book that, ^might have been dated a bit^ because it said that Mars had seasonal changes of color,<br>that the color shifted towards brown during Autumn, because of falling leaves.</p>
  <p>I didn't buy it, but before I was going to return to that subject,<br>I needed to read about all the other things.</p>
  <p>I found it very interesting that Grafting Apple trees was common practice,<br>I immediately developed an interest in Combinatorial Geneomics.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Craig+Venter">Venter</a> packing codes into chromosome sequences,<br>and that darn article entitled <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/amazing-dna/">DNA seen through the eyes of a coder</a> could not be more fascinating.</p>
  <p>When I returned to Mars,<br>I got snagged on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI_9mN8JzpI">Mokele-mbembe</a> and of course X-Files.</p>
  <p>But even though this is a fairy tale, that was born of per-historic dinosaur bones, much like myths of dragons,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojig7uo7uuo">there are still great adventures to be had in that area of the world</a>.</p>
  <p>Bringing together solar, communication, single board computers,<br>cameras, virtual classrooms, solar mp3 players...</p>
  <p>Can make for a really interesting classroom,<br>especially when smart <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero/">Raspberry PI Zero</a> based<br><a href="https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos">Video Software</a> that can operate a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-noir-camera-v2/">Night Vision Camera</a> is very inexpensive.</p>
  <p>And can make beautiful videos that can help us watch Africa,<br>in a new light.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to talk about something as deeply personal as the Continuity of Growing Up,<br>for one it seems like it is not something that is granted to all.</p>
  <p>But like Maria teachers us,<br>it is something we must each fight for.</p>
  <p>We have to make our way towards books that inspire us,<br>even if all we can do is to spend a life time to build the first book lending network in our part of Congo, or Amazon, or Outback, or Siberia.</p>
  <p>When knowledge is taken away from us,<br>we have to take it back.</p>

  <p>I also had an interest in Archaeology,<br>my parents took me to see Castles and Museums.</p>
  <p>In context of archaeology, I was ravenous, and rabid,<br>I had no reservations when it came to fake education, so as long as I was learning for real.</p>
  <p>Memorizing dates, overwork, unpaid-internships<br>and digs in dangerous places on the brink of military coups, was my middle name.</p>
  <p>If I was allowed to roam free, they would have pulled me into Oxford,<br>to give me an education so that I could learn to follow at least some of the rules.</p>
  <p>Oxford Archaeology by the way, is one of the largest and oldest archaeology practices in Europe,<br>it is a stone throw away from where I used to live, and had I been allowed to grow up, I would have become a brilliant thorn in their side.</p>

  <p>I grew up by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Al%C4%99%C5%BCa">Ślęża</a>,<br>so I would have dug for the Tribes that worshiped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artio">Mother Bear</a>, that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid">Worshiped The Sun</a></p>
  <p>I would have gathered all my Artio statues on Midsummer Night for all to see,<br>as an old man I would have inspired hundreds to Archaeology, to books, to the gift of words on paper, as Maria would say.</p>
  <p>Today is June 25th,<br>what better day to celebrate Midsummer Day, than a Friday.</p>
  <p>And this is my celebration,<br>to mention Artio, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_Queen">Queen of the Fae</a> and show the world that Myths are amazing teachers.</p>
  <p>After all, what can teach the Kingly Virtues, better,<br>than the Arthurian legend.</p>

  <p>Similarly, The discovery of a passage in a science book,<br>that mentions there being trees on Mars, is a call to great adventure like few other.</p>
  <p>This is not just an interplanetary adventure,<br>it is an interstellar adventure.</p>
  <p>One, that has a real beginning with <a href="https://youtu.be/xvm7dB0mOic?t=741">Percival Lowell</a>,<br>and his observatory.</p>
  <p>And beautiful Speculative and Impecable Poetry and Hard Science of cosmos,<br>and our place in it.</p>
  <p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bWK5ES3lTE">Frank Drake</a>, driven by the wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EszGIvRdgTE">Jill Tarter</a><br>and lovable and funny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Seth+Shostak">Seth Shostak</a> the SETI Institute.</p>
  <p>Jill Tarter inspired the character of Ellie played by Jodie Foster in Carl Sagan's Cosmos,<br><a href="https://youtu.be/EszGIvRdgTE?t=152">Ms. Tarter reminds us that if we are alone then it is an awful waste of space</a>.</p>
  <p>There are neither Trees nor canals on Mars,<br>but these ideas were only meant to be questions, that would be matched by answers provided by proper science.</p>
  <p>What was a stepping stone for Percival Lowell,<br>became a launch pad for people like Carl Sagan.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXQbGs11PWU">Sagan was very fond on Martian Adventures</a>,<br>he says he would spread his arms at night and wish to be transported to Mars like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62_bG0Bgsto">John Carter</a>.</p>

  <p>Fantasy and odyssey, and even X-Files and Mokele-mbembe continue inspiring countless generations,<br>not just to more fiction but also to science.</p>
  <p>ANd to daring Greatly, in new fields like Combinatorial Genomics,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHIocNOHd7A">where we are just getting started with ideas like synthetic life and the creation of new species</a></p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA">Continuity, can take us to the infinite future</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGiQaabX3_o">or can help us understand our ancient past</a>.</p>

  <p>It matters not if it starts with dreams of canals or fighting aliens on Mars,<br>or capturing a photo of Mokele-mbembe, all dreams are equally good.</p>
  <p>But it does matter that the continuity of our dreams of adventure is unbroken,<br>so that each step lies on top of the previous step, and that we grow.</p>

  <p>Do not let anybody push you away from your dreams,<br>not your brothers or sister, not mom not dad, not preachers, nor teachers; your dreams, are yours.</p>
  <p>If there is a force that is pushing you already, and seems impenetrable,<br>then you are in luck, because the Universes has chosen for you, to become a Great Warrior and Leader, and a force of change.</p>
  <p>Fantastic stories are not just for entertainment,<br>if you are young then let John Carter teach you strategy.</p>
  <p>The continuity of your growing up can only be broken if you don't realize how precious it is,<br>the path of great adventures, intergalactic fantasies, and inspirational curiosities that lies before you, is your to travel.</p>
  <p>It is your responsibility to build your mind step by uninterrupted step,<br>to make each day better than the previous, and to make yourself strong enough to stand up to the meanest and biggest creatures of the best of the fantasy books.</p>
  <p>When people come to tell you that you can't dream of Mars, or Stars, or Past or Future, Science, Technology, and or Philosophy,<br>just tell them, that what they say is pretty good...</p>
  <p>But it is not good enough for you, because your aim is Greatness,<br>growing all the way up.</p>
  <p>And to become a Great Being you have much to learn,<br>and that you will learn it your own way, at your own pace, and in a sequence that fits you best.</p>
  <p>Don't let anybody trick you into thinking that you are not good enough,<br>because the world needs you.</p>
  <p>The world must advance,<br>it cannot stand still.</p>
  <p>The World,<br>Must Grow.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For one the world is poor,<br>everyone is tired and stressed out.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I love how she used to say that children should appreciate: the gift of words on paper,<br>she knew, she learned from books on her own, so she knew about inheriting knowledge from great beings.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">It is when we are little that we can really easily narrow down our interests,<br>I was curious about the stars, I remember writing a short thing about the Kosmos.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And I had a book that, ^might have been dated a bit^ because it said that Mars had seasonal changes of color,<br>that the color shifted towards brown during Autumn, because of falling leaves.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I didn't buy it, but before I was going to return to that subject,<br>I needed to read about all the other things.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I found it very interesting that Grafting Apple trees was common practice,<br>I immediately developed an interest in Combinatorial Geneomics.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Craig+Venter">Venter</a> packing codes into chromosome sequences,<br>and that darn article entitled <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/amazing-dna/">DNA seen through the eyes of a coder</a> could not be more fascinating.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When I returned to Mars,<br>I got snagged on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TI_9mN8JzpI">Mokele-mbembe</a> and of course X-Files.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But even though this is a fairy tale, that was born of per-historic dinosaur bones, much like myths of dragons,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojig7uo7uuo">there are still great adventures to be had in that area of the world</a>.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">We have to make our way towards books that inspire us,<br>even if all we can do is to spend a life time to build the first book lending network in our part of Congo, or Amazon, or Outback, or Siberia.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In context of archaeology, I was ravenous, and rabid,<br>I had no reservations when it came to fake education, so as long as I was learning for real.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Memorizing dates, overwork, unpaid-internships<br>and digs in dangerous places on the brink of military coups, was my middle name.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">If I was allowed to roam free, they would have pulled me into Oxford,<br>to give me an education so that I could learn to follow at least some of the rules.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Oxford Archaeology by the way, is one of the largest and oldest archaeology practices in Europe,<br>it is a stone throw away from where I used to live, and had I been allowed to grow up, I would have become a brilliant thorn in their side.</div>

  <p>To invent we have to stop being scared of poverty,<br>we can only invent in peace - and that requires courage.</p>
  <p>Fear really is the mind killer,<br>but it is also true that we are all warriors.</p>
  <p>There are many things we can do in life to become courageous,<br>we can listen to great books, take to great adventure, become observers of the world.</p>

  <p>Or set up a cabin by a pond, ensure biscuit and tea,<br>and write to become the Great American Philosopher.</p>
  <p>Sometimes a lawn makes for a great pond,<br>and thus our lonesome apartments too, can serve as a proper cabin by the Walden Pond.</p>

  <p>Courage must come first,<br>this is very sad.</p>
  <p>But, overall,<br>courage is good for us.</p>
  <p>Aside from helping with invention, it is great for little adventures, petting large animals,<br>or getting into mediocre books.</p>

  <p>What is worse, is that people like teachers will unknowingly destroy<br>genius, creativity, invention, and force students into memorizing.</p>
  <p>Whether they know it or not,<br>we can’t let anybody rob us of our genius.</p>
  <p>School is just a drop, in the ocean of life,<br>but it can trick us into thinking that we aren’t smart, if we let it.</p>
  <p>We are supposed to invent,<br>and become independent from the rest of the world.</p>

  <p>I remember in my Plymouth High School,<br>there was a drawing made with markers, and it seemed so perfect, that it made me feel stupid.</p>
  <p>I thought to myself “I could never create something like this, college is not for me”,<br>the marker lines didn’t overlap, the colors were amazing, and the portrait was beautiful.</p>
  <p>I lacked wisdom and courage of invention,<br>I lacked courage to say “I will invent my way to this”.</p>
  <p>Back then I still didn’t get around to contemplating talent,<br>so I thought it was something people were born with.</p>
  <p>But it is stupid to think that someone is born with the ability to kick ass at markers,<br>we are risen apes - not fallen angels.</p>

  <p>I never lacked courage for standing up what was right,<br>because I could see and feel that bullies were evil.</p>
  <p>I dropped out of the high school the moment the Biology Teacher said “weed is an herb”,<br>I don't need to hear more.</p>
  <p>Here was the first time I faced a true enemy that truly outranked me,<br>the Guidance Counselor.</p>
  <p>He told me I would never be anything in life,<br>who says such things.</p>
  <p>I think this started an investigation,<br>because when I showed up at the AdultEd, they were waiting for me.</p>

  <p>There was a coffee shop near by,<br>the teenagers there were out of control.</p>
  <p>But to me they were just crazy,<br>they were not evil, they would do no harm.</p>
  <p>I remember sitting on the couch,<br>and looking up - someone took the ceiling panes home and used them as canvas.</p>
  <p>There was a panel with electronics on it,<br>and what clearly looked like water colors.</p>
  <p>It was the kids that were there,<br>that painted them - the troublemakers.</p>

  <p>A 29 year old woman showed up one time, I called her Wendy,<br>I immediately warned the main troublemaker to be kind to her.</p>
  <p>She looked at me and said “Oh, so this is the bad boy” pointing at him,<br>he told her that we would only cause trouble because his mom.</p>
  <p>On second thought,<br>the teenagers at The Brew Ha Ha, were Angels.</p>
  <p>Our world ended when the Brew closed,<br>we all immediately grew up to become Philosophers.</p>

  <p>Be it teachers, parents, schools, bullies,<br>we must retain our integrity, and protect our genius.</p>
  <p>Bad people and those who are mislead into doing wrong things, always lose - always,<br>they become crappy stories of growing up and what not to do.</p>
  <p>Being courageous and protecting our genius, clears the mind,<br>it helps us unplug from the errors in other people’s heads.</p>

  <p>Once our wisdom ignites,<br>there is no telling what height we will reach.</p>

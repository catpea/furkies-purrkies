  <div class="paragraph">If you grant me, that growing up is more than mere aging,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and that the other component is Intellectual Development.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if we agree that we each start near zero,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and carry on upwards eventually becoming unique and creating undiscovered paths.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And if we agree that this idea cannot be used to belittle people,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">it can only be used for growing up, and towards Humanity's Noblest goals.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Then,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there is something you should know.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">You can't speak to all people who are still developing on different heights and in different paths,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">not in the same language, and each unique height will carry unique concepts that can't translate.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">While we share a lot,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">we don't share enough to communicate in ways that help us converge towards Wisdom.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">There cannot be a single language with shared deeply held beliefs,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">on subjects that relate to progressing forward or upward.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Each,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">must learn to translate, interpret and understand the other.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">The speakers who who speak only on their own intellectual level,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">and from within their own culture are not enough to help the world grow.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">Nor will there ever be a single mountain peak where we all converge,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">there can only be a certain height that will help cultures understand each other.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">But, we do share the act of rising up, of growing up towards Wisdom,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of standing in relentless pursuits of excellence.</div>
</div>
<div class="section avoid-break-inside" style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
  <div class="paragraph">And,</div>
  <div class="paragraph">of helping each other so that we may grow in Peace.</div>

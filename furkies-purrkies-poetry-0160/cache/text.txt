If you grant me, that growing up is more than mere aging,
and that the other component is Intellectual Development.
And if we agree that we each start near zero,
and carry on upwards eventually becoming unique and creating undiscovered paths.
And if we agree that this idea cannot be used to belittle people,
it can only be used for growing up, and towards Humanity's Noblest goals.
Then,
there is something you should know.
You can't speak to all people who are still developing on different heights and in different paths,
not in the same language, and each unique height will carry unique concepts that can't translate.
While we share a lot,
we don't share enough to communicate in ways that help us converge towards Wisdom.
There cannot be a single language with shared deeply held beliefs,
on subjects that relate to progressing forward or upward.
Each,
must learn to translate, interpret and understand the other.
The speakers who who speak only on their own intellectual level,
and from within their own culture are not enough to help the world grow.
Nor will there ever be a single mountain peak where we all converge,
there can only be a certain height that will help cultures understand each other.
But, we do share the act of rising up, of growing up towards Wisdom,
of standing in relentless pursuits of excellence.
And,
of helping each other so that we may grow in Peace.

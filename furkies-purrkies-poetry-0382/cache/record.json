metropark there.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">If you set of early morning,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">you can make it in one day.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But it gets weird, when you are already tired,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and you realize you are only half way through your journey.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It would be nice to spend some time on that little lookout,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there are lots of fancy geese there in the summer.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">As an exploratory expedition,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it is a perfect adventure.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">But maybe staying at the tent site,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and maybe a hotel in flat-rock could be pretty fun.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It would become a three or four day adventure,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and there is nothing here that is too wiled or deprived, it is just fancy bicycle trails.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Another option is to have your family or friends have a get together at the The Lake Erie Metropark,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and then drive you back, so that you can enjoy the BBQ.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Overall, I think every park deserves an adventure into,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">they usually have more to offer than a parking area.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">For example the Lower Huron Metropark has a <span>Turtle Cove Family Aquatic Center<sup>[12]</sup></span> attraction,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">people go there to swim in the summer.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Personally, I really enjoyed a small pick-nick I setup for myself one summer,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">at a lonely bench by the tiny <span>Washago Pond<sup>[13]</sup></span>.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">As to the bicycle it self...</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Riding a bicycle takes a little while to get used to,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and I recommend a soft seat, with extra padding.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And actually buying a bicycle and maintaining it is not hard,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">because you want a simple bicycle.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Don't buy one with crazy shifters and break handles,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and break discs, wires and lines.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It will all squeak, it will need annoying adjustments,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">it will rust, or bend and sometimes fall out.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The less a bike has the less will get broken,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">with the exception of the tires, get a simple $300 fat tire bike.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Sometimes you get a lemon, so be ready to take it back to the store for a quick replacement,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I own a Mongoose 26 Inch Brutus Alloy All Terrain Mountain Bike.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It cost me $150 at a local supermarket,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">as it was $100 off.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I replaced my Handlebar with one meant for an ATV,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">as it is few inches wider, but the older one was not too bad.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">I only needed to remove once screw to replace the handlebar,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">since there are no break handles or gear shifters to mess with.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">The way you stop the bike, is by moving the pedals backwards a little bit,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">there is breaking mechanism that is triggered by that reverse motion.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <br>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">It does get loud on the trail because it runs by a highway,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">so just in case it gets too annoying bring some foam earplugs make sure they are rated NRR 33.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">And remember sun tan lotion,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and bug repellent.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">All the adventures out there are stunning,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">no matter where you go.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section avoid-break-inside\" style=\"padding-bottom: 2rem;\">\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">Add some music or audio books,</div>\n  <div class=\"paragraph\">and short weekends will slowly transform into long and adventure filled vacations.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"break-after\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"section\"

  <p>We know schools are such an important thing,<br>that every child in the world goes to school - just like that.</p>

  <p>We correctly see schools as part of growing up,<br>we see denying schools as a horrible crime.</p>
  <p>Our vision falters beyond that point,<br>because we don't quite yet know what effective education is.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">We have some really, really good ideas about real schools</a>,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">but we are far from creating real good ones</a>.</p>
  <p>We are close, we are really are,<br>we just now identified that we can't have grades, and that we probably can't have subject divisions.</p>

  <p>We needed the emergence of real schools somewhere in the 50's or 90's,<br>we really messed up, though it is just now that we started carrying computers in our pockets.</p>
  <p>It is just now, that we are beginning to see,<br>that school starts on a little screen, and is driven by the student's own curiosity, not a mangled curriculum.</p>
  <p>It is their amazing creations will create a passion for subjects that seem awful at first,<br>the students best learn in context of their curiosities.</p>
  <p>And we are just now learning that real education is not just about knowledge,<br>learning for real ignites creativity, empowers wisdom, and drives students towards Greatness.</p>

  <p>A lot of mistakes can be prevented by making schools more powerful,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmoor8DwqW4">by not pretending that what we have today, works</a>.</p>
  <p>All school graduates when looking back at their experience,<br>can easily see how ineffective their education was.</p>
  <p>We all know, and we do nothing to fix it,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY">we push students into memorization at the cost of their creativity</a>.</p>
  <p>This is such an urgent issue,<br>that we should ask all the world's students to stop memorizing for tests, and demand effective education.</p>

  <p>We have to help them to reject the easily corruptible the grade system,<br>and push the teachers into guiding them into an integrated self-directed education.</p>
  <p>We must explain to all the world's students that real education,<br>is a door to creativity, wisdom and greatness - the very thing that their mind and future depends on.</p>
  <p>And we ourselves must understand,<br>that our wars must not be fought by our children.</p>
  <p>Our greatest invention is not technology, or schools and books,<br>it is our culture of world peace, creativity and education, wisdom and achievement, leadership and unity, advancement and greatness.</p>

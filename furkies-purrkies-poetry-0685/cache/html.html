  <p>To simplify it and put it in normal language,<br>sans ways of thinking and noble pursuits; it means Class.</p>
  <p>In High School it means not lying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEFMVIfl2UY">nor participating in lies</a>,<br>not fighting, only only protecting yourself.</p>
  <p>And it means not following others,<br>when someone brings a can of beer...</p>
  <p>Merely using a paint mixer to creatively shake it up,<br>and setting it back in the fridge, quietly hoping that dad hangs on to the rest of his brainless.</p>
  <p>Not following means walking your own path,<br>a path where little thing matter, where you are more than a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs35t2xFqdU">brick in the wall</a>.</p>
  <p>Ennobling deeds come in all shapes and sizes,<br>they relate to you as well as others.</p>
  <p>For example, never allowing anyone to tell you that you are less than a brilliant genius,<br>is a noble deed, because it is tough not to allow grades, to trick you that you are not smart.</p>
  <p>When you fail a test or even need to repeat a class,<br>it is a Noble Being that walks unbroken, probably while listening to Science Audio Books.</p>

  <p>A little bit later in life, you will have to do the same,<br>but on a much larger scale.</p>
  <p>When overwork or misery tries to crush you, you rise and rise,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmmH-2rWHH0">until you cross the Bridge of the Gods</a>,</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6_QUhUPrF4">Rising all the way straight into perfect laughter</a>,<br>is the same Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄de as having once rejected bad grades, and taken to your own noble paths.</p>

  <p>Your Dẹ̄des add up to make you infinitely beautiful, timeless, and unbreakable,<br>they make you wise and show that you have class.</p>
  <p>Now, as with all things this is slightly more complicated than it seems,<br>it is not in our culture to aim young people at Wisdom, Class, and Ennobling Deeds.</p>
  <p>There are people who do end up drinking that beer,<br>and carry on to spend years doing broken things.</p>
  <p>And those broken things,<br>must not break them either.</p>
  <p>Rising from a path where none urged to Wisdom and Class,<br>is a Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄de in it self.</p>
  <p>A bully, a thief, a criminal, an alcoholic,<br>will surely carry their burden and the consequences of their actions.</p>
  <p>But that will only make their back stronger,<br>as in their wisdom they guard the point of no return that they were abandoned to cross.</p>

  <p>Overall, nothing that we have been through should crush us,<br>the road required to put things right maybe longer.</p>
  <p>And happiness of people who have been through a rough time maybe much different,<br>from those who rose to become artists - but all roads to greatness make for Great Beings.</p>

  <p>The important point to take away from this,<br>is that no one should stay down crushed in any way, not a single person.</p>
  <p>We rise, we rise,<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qviM_GnJbOM">we rise to Greatness</a></p>

  <p>You might have guessed that the words Gentlelady and Gentleman,<br>describe a person who has been ennobled by their Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄des, by rising towards Greatness, with "the nobleness of The Human Spirit".</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">To simplify it and put it in normal language,<br>sans ways of thinking and noble pursuits; it means Class.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">In High School it means not lying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEFMVIfl2UY">nor participating in lies</a>,<br>not fighting, only only protecting yourself.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And it means not following others,<br>when someone brings a can of beer...</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Merely using a paint mixer to creatively shake it up,<br>and setting it back in the fridge, quietly hoping that dad hangs on to the rest of his brainless.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Not following means walking your own path,<br>a path where little thing matter, where you are more than a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs35t2xFqdU">brick in the wall</a>.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Ennobling deeds come in all shapes and sizes,<br>they relate to you as well as others.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example, never allowing anyone to tell you that you are less than a brilliant genius,<br>is a noble deed, because it is tough not to allow grades, to trick you that you are not smart.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">When you fail a test or even need to repeat a class,<br>it is a Noble Being that walks unbroken, probably while listening to Science Audio Books.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">There are people who do end up drinking that beer,<br>and carry on to spend years doing broken things.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Rising from a path where none urged to Wisdom and Class,<br>is a Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄de in it self.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">A bully, a thief, a criminal, an alcoholic,<br>will surely carry their burden and the consequences of their actions.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But that will only make their back stronger,<br>as in their wisdom they guard the point of no return that they were abandoned to cross.</div>

[Ǧentī̆l][1] [Dẹ̄des][2] comes from Middle English,
and means Ennobling Deeds, or Noble Great Achievements.

To simplify it and put it in normal language,
sans ways of thinking and noble pursuits; it means Class.

In High School it means not lying [nor participating in lies][0],
not fighting, only only protecting yourself.

And it means not following others,
when someone brings a can of beer...

Merely using a paint mixer to creatively shake it up,
and setting it back in the fridge, quietly hoping that dad hangs on to the rest of his brainless.

Not following means walking your own path,
a path where little thing matter, where you are more than a [brick in the wall][6].

Ennobling deeds come in all shapes and sizes,
they relate to you as well as others.

For example, never allowing anyone to tell you that you are less than a brilliant genius,
is a noble deed, because it is tough not to allow grades, to trick you that you are not smart.

When you fail a test or even need to repeat a class,
it is a Noble Being that walks unbroken, probably while listening to Science Audio Books.

A little bit later in life, you will have to do the same,
but on a much larger scale.

When overwork or misery tries to crush you, you rise and rise,
[until you cross the Bridge of the Gods][3],

[Rising all the way straight into perfect laughter][4],
is the same Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄de as having once rejected bad grades, and taken to your own noble paths.

---

Your Dẹ̄des add up to make you infinitely beautiful, timeless, and unbreakable,
they make you wise and show that you have class.

Now, as with all things this is slightly more complicated than it seems,
it is not in our culture to aim young people at Wisdom, Class, and Ennobling Deeds.

There are people who do end up drinking that beer,
and carry on to spend years doing broken things.

And those broken things,
must not break them either.

Rising from a path where none urged to Wisdom and Class,
is a Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄de in it self.

A bully, a thief, a criminal, an alcoholic,
will surely carry their burden and the consequences of their actions.

But that will only make their back stronger,
as in their wisdom they guard the point of no return that they were abandoned to cross.

---

Overall, nothing that we have been through should crush us,
the road required to put things right maybe longer.

And happiness of people who have been through a rough time maybe much different,
from those who rose to become artists - but all roads to greatness make for Great Beings.

---

The important point to take away from this,
is that no one should stay down crushed in any way, not a single person.

We rise, we rise,
[we rise to Greatness][5]

---

You might have guessed that the words Gentlelady and Gentleman,
describe a person who has been ennobled by their Ǧentī̆l Dẹ̄des, by rising towards Greatness, with "the nobleness of The Human Spirit".

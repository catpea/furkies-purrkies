  <p>I returned from the gym,<br>rested my legs a tiny bit.</p>
  <p>And discovered it started snowing,<br>right after I came back home.</p>
  <p>There was an inch of snow,<br>on the ground already.</p>
  <p>How did I miss this,<br>ridiculous.</p>

  <p>I already had most of my gear packed,<br>but I still had to upgrade mys shoes.</p>
  <p>I tend to use elastic shoelaces,<br>they really are flexible and don't get untied.</p>
  <p>I bought new shoes,<br>that I tested with a very thick woolen sock.</p>
  <p>My shoe is two size larger,<br>a wide 13 with non slip thread.</p>
  <p>I came pretty close,<br>but what I needed was waterproof outdoor shoes for sport.</p>
  <p>Waterproof just means,<br>that there is no mesh/vent for water to get in.</p>
  <p>They are hard to find,<br>they also need to have a low sole as not to twist an ankle.</p>
  <p>I just checked all shoes,<br>regular stores don't have the proper kind.</p>
  <p>I found the socks at at hunting isle,<br>in a near by supermarket.</p>
  <p>They are so thick, that you need to bring the socks with you,<br>and test your shoe finds with the sock.</p>
  <p>The sock will keep you warm,<br>but also smooth out any imperfections in the shoe.</p>

  <p>I did try sliding in the snow on purpose,<br>and I slid a for a foot or two.</p>
  <p>But slow jogging,<br>is just faster walking.</p>
  <p>And rolling the ball of the foot,<br>improves stability.</p>
  <p>You can't trip running that way,<br>even on a snow covered surface.</p>
  <p>Rolling the ball of the foot is kind of like,<br>manually rolling a tire across snow.</p>

  <p>I think it was about 33 degrees Fahrenheit,<br>I had three elastic shirts and a hoodie.</p>
  <p>But I was overheating,<br>unzipping the hoodie a little bit on my way back didn't help.</p>
  <p>For pants I had two track pants and shorts,<br>that I managed not to put on the outside, yay!</p>
  <p>By the way, people, including <a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Superman?lang=en">Superman</a>,<br>wear shorts on the outside.</p>
  <p>So that they can remove them if it gets too hot,<br>without removing pants first.</p>

  <p>You know, what is Superman supposed to do,<br>in the middle of a damp battle.</p>
  <p>It would have been a scandal,<br>if he had to take his leotard off first.</p>
  <p>Smartly, the man of steel,<br>puts his underwear on last.</p>
  <p>And anyway,<br><a href="https://wikiless.org/wiki/Batman?lang=en">Batman</a> does it too, and I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh4-0by2No">European comics</a>.</p>

  <p>I waddled out of my apartment complex,<br>and started slowly jogging with my 10lb. dumbbells.</p>
  <p>It felt great,<br>I was barely overheating.</p>
  <p>But, the time I got to the intersection,<br>I noticed the snow direction.</p>
  <p>Moments later the snow was getting in my eyes,<br>it was impossible to run.</p>
  <p>More than rain,<br>snowflakes cause discomfort.</p>
  <p>And I had to stop,<br>and put my snow goggles on.</p>
  <p>Maybe, sunglasses could work,<br>but goggles was all I had.</p>
  <p>I was saving them,<br>for dangerously cold weather.</p>
  <p>But it makes sense to just cover the whole face,<br>the snow isn't going to pile up and melt in your eyes.</p>
  <p>Of course, I looked Sus!<br>felt like an impostor at first.</p>
  <p>But, this, is, Michigan,<br>it snows here - goggles are not that weird.</p>
  <p>I pulled up my ski mask over my nose,<br>and kept going, with a smile.</p>

  <p>That's when I noticed how soft the snow was,<br>running on soft snow is perfect.</p>
  <p>It is soft when landing your foot,<br>and firm when shifting weight.</p>
  <p>Depending on snow,<br>it maybe better than running in the woods.</p>

  <p>I made it half way,<br>turned around, and moved my googles up over my forehead.</p>
  <p>In retrospect, not a good idea,<br>as they fogged up.</p>
  <p>If I needed them on again,<br>I would have to wipe them first.</p>
  <p>My googles double as light sunglasses,<br>so when I took them off.</p>
  <p>The milkiness of snow really hit me,<br>it looked so magical - I stopped to take a photo.</p>

  <p>Wearing my hoodie,<br>was also a mistake.</p>
  <p>All the snow that landed on me,<br>melted from my warmth, and the hoodie got wet.</p>
  <p>It is best to wear something,<br>that the snow won't stick to.</p>
  <p>But I was very warm,<br>I felt great.</p>

  <p>It was a perfect little run,<br>and it is better to run before sundown.</p>
  <p>After dark,<br>is risky.</p>
  <p>It is harder for drivers to see,<br>and they will have delayed reactions as a result.</p>
  <p>Wearing a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=100%25+Reflective+Running+Vest">Reflective Running Vest</a> will help a bit,<br>but it is better to stick to running during the day.</p>

  <p>Finally, wearing your jogging clothes at home just about for 20 minutes before a run,<br>will get you started with body heat.</p>
  <p>This way you don't have to wait to heat up,<br>you just start off warm.</p>
  <p>It is still somewhat strange to me,<br>how jogging, prevents getting cold outside.</p>
  <p>While it is still good to run in the summer,<br>it is <strong>better</strong> to run in winter, by far.</p>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They are hard to find,<br>they also need to have a low sole as not to twist an ankle.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I just checked all shoes,<br>regular stores don't have the proper kind.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">I found the socks at at hunting isle,<br>in a near by supermarket.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">They are so thick, that you need to bring the socks with you,<br>and test your shoe finds with the sock.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The sock will keep you warm,<br>but also smooth out any imperfections in the shoe.</div>

  "text": "I returned from the gym,\nrested my legs a tiny bit.\nAnd discovered it started snowing,\nright after I came back home.\nThere was an inch of snow,\non the ground already.\nHow did I miss this,\nridiculous.\n\nI already had most of my gear packed,\nbut I still had to upgrade mys shoes.\nI tend to use elastic shoelaces,\nthey really are flexible and don't get untied.\nI bought new shoes,\nthat I tested with a very thick woolen sock.\nMy shoe is two size larger,\na wide 13 with non slip thread.\nI came pretty close,\nbut what I needed was waterproof outdoor shoes for sport.\nWaterproof just means,\nthat there is no mesh/vent for water to get in.\nThey are hard to find,\nthey also need to have a low sole as not to twist an ankle.\nI just checked all shoes,\nregular stores don't have the proper kind.\nI found the socks at at hunting isle,\nin a near by supermarket.\nThey are so thick, that you need to bring the socks with you,\nand test your shoe finds with the sock.\nThe sock will keep you warm,\nbut also smooth out any imperfections in the shoe.\n\nI did try sliding in the snow on purpose,\nand I slid a for a foot or two.\nBut slow jogging,\nis just faster walking.\nAnd rolling the ball of the foot,\nimproves stability.\nYou can't trip running that way,\neven on a snow covered surface.\nRolling the ball of the foot is kind of like,\nmanually rolling a tire across snow.\n\nI think it was about 33 degrees Fahrenheit,\nI had three elastic shirts and a hoodie.\nBut I was overheating,\nunzipping the hoodie a little bit on my way back didn't help.\nFor pants I had two track pants and shorts,\nthat I managed not to put on the outside, yay!\nBy the way, people, including Superman[1],\nwear shorts on the outside.\nSo that they can remove them if it gets too hot,\nwithout removing pants first.\n\nYou know, what is Superman supposed to do,\nin the middle of a damp battle.\nIt would have been a scandal,\nif he had to take his leotard off first.\nSmartly, the man of steel,\nputs his underwear on last.\nAnd anyway,\nBatman[2] does it too, and I like European comics[3].\n\nI waddled out of my apartment complex,\nand started slowly jogging with my 10lb. dumbbells.\nIt felt great,\nI was barely overheating.\nBut, the time I got to the intersection,\nI noticed the snow direction.\nMoments later the snow was getting in my eyes,\nit was impossible to run.\nMore than rain,\nsnowflakes cause discomfort.\nAnd I had to stop,\nand put my snow goggles on.\nMaybe, sunglasses could work,\nbut goggles was all I had.\nI was saving them,\nfor dangerously cold weather.\nBut it makes sense to just cover the whole face,\nthe snow isn't going to pile up and melt in your eyes.\nOf course, I looked Sus!\nfelt like an impostor at first.\nBut, this, is, Michigan,\nit snows here - goggles are not that weird.\nI pulled up my ski mask over my nose,\nand kept going, with a smile.\n\nThat's when I noticed how soft the snow was,\nrunning on soft snow is perfect.\nIt is soft when landing your foot,\nand firm when shifting weight.\nDepending on snow,\nit maybe better than running in the woods.\n\nI made it half way,\nturned around, and moved my googles up over my forehead.\nIn retrospect, not a good idea,\nas they fogged up.\nIf I needed them on again,\nI would have to wipe them first.\nMy googles double as light sunglasses,\nso when I took them off.\nThe milkiness of snow really hit me,\nit looked so magical - I stopped to take a photo.\n\nWearing my hoodie,\nwas also a mistake.\nAll the snow that landed on me,\nmelted from my warmth, and the hoodie got wet.\nIt is best to wear something,\nthat the snow won't stick to.\nBut I was very warm,\nI felt great.\n\nIt was a perfect little run,\nand it is better to run before sundown.\nAfter dark,\nis risky.\nIt is harder for drivers to see,\nand they will have delayed reactions as a result.\nWearing a Reflective Running Vest[4] will help a bit,\nbut it is better to stick to running during the day.\n\nFinally, wearing your jogging clothes at home just about for 20 minutes before a run,\nwill get you started with body heat.\nThis way you don't have to wait to heat up,\nyou just start off warm.\nIt is still somewhat strange to me,\nhow jogging, prevents getting cold outside.\nWhile it is still good to run in the summer,\nit is better to run in winter, by far.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://wikiless.org/wiki/Superman?lang=en\n[2]: https://wikiless.org/wiki/Batman?lang=en\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSh4-0by2No\n[4]: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=100%25+Reflective+Running+Vest",

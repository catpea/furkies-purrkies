    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">School is a great way to learn about corruption, lies,<br>and what shared fantasies look like.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Just like everyone used to believe in fairy tales,<br>now everyone believes, that you can learn things that aren't interesting.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Whatever you can learn this way,<br>is too trivial to bother with right now.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Whatever you just cant understand,<br>that is because someone is forcing you to learn them without context.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">For example, when programming screensavers learning math is really fun,<br>sitting in a classroom watching a big fat white louse selling you out for a paycheck, will prevent you from learning anything .</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">And the bigger things that your teacher will trick you, into cramming for,<br>you will forget them, and not just the normal way.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">But also because big things require frequent practice,<br>you have to stay in a circle of practice.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Programming, Digital Painting, Hard Surface Modeling, Jewelry Modeling and Sculpting,<br>Procedural 3D Objects, Dancing, Jogging, Bicycling, Writing and Poetry....</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">...and all the other stuff,<br>and back to Programming.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">That is why you can’t learn what is not interesting to you,<br>because you won’t plug it into your cycle of self education and practice.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Find what you like, preferably something that seems confusing,<br>and lay siege to the thing, until you come out running like an expert.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Why running you ask? that’s the self education momentum,<br>you are running like a Puma or Tiger to lay siege to the next interesting thing.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The more you learn,<br>the more new and interesting things you find.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">What is it all for? With each new thing you learn you plow through,<br>your notion of how intelligent you are.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">You become smarter, which in turn keeps you sharp, motivated, healthy,<br>and curious about the world.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">The more interesting things you learn,<br>the more interesting the world becomes.</div>

    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">(But please, as you add clearance to close your wallet,<br>don’t forget to add clearance for the cards, like I just did.</div>
    <div class="paragraph card-text card-stanza my-5 text-center">Even so, since it is computer program that builds the wallet,<br>you just add a new math node to the credit card size box calculation and voila.)</div>

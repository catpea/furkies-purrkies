  <p>While colors can be stylized,<br>and in some ways made better.</p>
  <p>It is best to start with true colors,<br>and add the enhancements later.</p>
  <p>The enhanced color palette,<br>can rest on a separate layer.</p>
  <p>Thus allowing for multiple color themes,<br>to exist in one file.</p>

  <p>At some point,<br>it is no longer profitable to refine shapes.</p>
  <p>The user will not perceive them,<br>no matter how fine the details.</p>
  <p>And it may be a bad idea,<br>as imperfections serve as proof of painting.</p>
  <p>The thing that is missing from a photograph,<br>is effort and unique imperfection.</p>

  <p>Here digital painting,<br>yet again makes things easier.</p>
  <p>It is very easy to zoom-in,<br>in a computer program.</p>
  <p>On real canvas we are limited,<br>by the brush size.</p>
  <p>We have to choose either a blurry painting,<br>or a large canvas and standing further back.</p>

  <p>When exhibiting, it is very important,<br>to display your digital paintings large.</p>
  <p>Large enough,<br>to reveal the brushstrokes.</p>
  <p>Brushstrokes and imperfections,<br>set the background music to the subject.</p>
  <p>The visitors or your customers,<br>will want to see and dream about what it takes.</p>

  <p>The distance to your first exhibition,<br>is shorter than to a proper portfolio.</p>
  <p>It maybe as little as 10 photographs,<br>and about 30 days of digital painting.</p>
  <p>You are not limited to canvas,<br>you can use large monitors, or wall projectors.</p>
  <p>And only order a physical print and frame,<br>after a sale is made.</p>

  <p>Even armed with shape reference<br>and the perfect palette...</p>
  <p>You will still need to build up structures,<br>and visualize the 3D shape of the eye or nose.</p>
  <p>As you still need to create surfaces and edges,<br>where surfaces and edges go.</p>
  <p>You will never get lost,<br>you will always be guided back into proper shape and color.</p>

  <p>It does not take long,<br>to memorize the features of a face.</p>
  <p>And sooner than later,<br>you will try to invent a face from imagination.</p>
  <p>Using your own shapes,<br>using your own palette.</p>
  <p>But he call of realism will only get louder,<br>true color will never cease calling.</p>

While colors can be stylized,
and in some ways made better.
It is best to start with true colors,
and add the enhancements later.
The enhanced color palette,
can rest on a separate layer.
Thus allowing for multiple color themes,
to exist in one file.

At some point,
it is no longer profitable to refine shapes.
The user will not perceive them,
no matter how fine the details.
And it may be a bad idea,
as imperfections serve as proof of painting.
The thing that is missing from a photograph,
is effort and unique imperfection.

Here digital painting,
yet again makes things easier.
It is very easy to zoom-in,
in a computer program.
On real canvas we are limited,
by the brush size.
We have to choose either a blurry painting,
or a large canvas and standing further back.

When exhibiting, it is very important,
to display your digital paintings large.
Large enough,
to reveal the brushstrokes.
Brushstrokes and imperfections,
set the background music to the subject.
The visitors or your customers,
will want to see and dream about what it takes.

The distance to your first exhibition,
is shorter than to a proper portfolio.
It maybe as little as 10 photographs,
and about 30 days of digital painting.
You are not limited to canvas,
you can use large monitors, or wall projectors.
And only order a physical print and frame,
after a sale is made.

Even armed with shape reference
and the perfect palette...
You will still need to build up structures,
and visualize the 3D shape of the eye or nose.
As you still need to create surfaces and edges,
where surfaces and edges go.
You will never get lost,
you will always be guided back into proper shape and color.

It does not take long,
to memorize the features of a face.
And sooner than later,
you will try to invent a face from imagination.
Using your own shapes,
using your own palette.
But he call of realism will only get louder,
true color will never cease calling.

  "text": "Our minds are already beautiful,\nbut we can make them even more beautiful.\nSimply by standing up,\nand refusing to follow, without Knowledge, and Wisdom, and even Greatness.\nWhen we follow,\nwe tend to end up in places that seem strange, if not alien, and it certainly does not seem like we belong there.\nSchool is like this,\nit sneaks up on us.\nWe go to school and begin waiting and memorizing instead of learning for real,\nbecause everybody else does that too, and we go because our parents went.\nWe make ourselves and, whatever that career is,\nfit.\n\nBut it is never quite,\nwhere we need to be.\nBecause when we do not lead,\nwe are bit by bit pushed off course.\n\nA large part of that,\nis that the school never really, truly, fully, gave you a full choice of subjects,\nYou had to pick from what was available,\nand what was available, were subjects that, everyone else was picking.\nNot only that, but also, you got, kind of manipulated into not picking some of the classes that interested you,\neither the prerequisites were set too high (to filter out low scoring students), or the teacher was iffy (to save money on a real professor).\nThe teacher also might have been acting wild, in a friendly way,\nand that type of behavior pushes away students that want a stable class, with a predictable and well mannered professor.\n\nYou got an impression of choice,\nbut in all actuality, you didn't even know the fields that would have interested you.\nThat was a promise that would be tucked away behind luck,\nif you were lucky to be picked by a prestigious open curriculum university, then maybe.\nBut even then, you weren't even within the culture (or the slipstream) of achievement,\nand whatever culture you could enter, by definition would be incompatible with your unique interests; it would be a culture of bunch of other people.\n\nSocializing is great,\nbut not in context of greatly multiplying your knowledge and intelligence, so that you have a full picture of the world.\n\nLet me just say,\nthat greatly multiplying knowledge and intelligence, is what we do as babies, what we do by default.\nNow, we do need a certain kind of guidance,\nyes.\nWe need to be taken to a Digital Audio Workstation, so that we are introduced to it,\nand and we need to see someone operating a piano roll[1].\nBut this requires,\n27 minutes and 51 seconds.\n\nYou see what the problem is,\nthe poverty of your school takes the piano, away from you.\nOr Microbiology at its most fascinating,\nactually getting to befriend Tardigrades through your own microscope, through your own eyes.\nAnd often,\njust about everything else that is fascinating.\nAnd they do it by mistake, and out of disrespect and dark ages[2],\nand to make the work of teaching a mass of students, more realistic.\nBut without the piano,\nyou don't become convinced that everything is a system of accessible easy to manipulate man-made concepts.\nIn deed, you are likely to end up being threatened to stop thinking about the piano,\nthreatened with prison, the prison of being held back a year.\n\nYou are constantly nudged off path,\nand threatened with shame or punishment when you resist.\n\nFocus on the path ahead,\nand ask, what if you were to make informed choices that were precisely your own.\nLet me define a term here,\nan informed choice is informed by about ten books, though you probably need to read-or-listen-to about fifty, to find those ten.\nSo here, rather than relying on classes that your school offers,\nyou expand your horizon of possibility...\nand begin relying on enchanting and deeply interesting _to you_,\nnarrated books.\n\nNow. Look, at the road ahead of you,\nis the road ahead of you not, more customized to who you are?\nPrecisely because you reached out for books and narrated books,\nand not; kept yourself boxed in a handful of classes, shame, and creepy threats...\n..that your school offers,\nbecause other students tend to pick those most often.\n\nThis is not to say that there is a conspiracy to deny you knowledge,\nbut rather that schools are not able to teach you Greatness and Beauty of Mind.\nFor one they don't get enough funding,\nbut also, Humans Are Stingy, would teachers teach you better, if they got paid more, or would they conserve their strength, and only do as much as strictly necessary.\n\nYou should not trust others with your own education,\nyou, should accept the responsibility for it.\nIt is a s easy as the Appalachian Trail[3],\na Thousand Audio Books, and a series of start-ups[4].\n\nA beautiful mind, is a lot more important than it may seem,\nit is a great step towards greatness.\nAnd Greatness,\nmakes all the difference.\n\nFor a long time now,\nthe world has been becoming more and more desperate for wisdom.\nAnd the only way, the world can grow in wisdom,\nis when you, and all other human beings on earth accept that challenge.\n\nIt gets even more complex, and more urgent,\nsome 150 species go extinct every day.\nThere are little over\n2,000 tigers left.\nThere are some 16,000 nuclear weapons,\nof which 2,000 are ready to be instantly launched at densely populated Cities... at the press of a button.\n\nA beautiful mind,\nand the Greatness that stems from it.\nMay soon,\nno longer be optional.\n\nGandhi said that he was inspired in part by Thoreau,\nand Martin Luther King Jr, said in turn that he was inspired by Gandhi.\nThoreau himself was inspired by Aristotle,\nwho was influenced by Plato and Socrates.\nAnd we need to ask,\nwhere would we be today without these Beautiful Minds?\n\nWhat if the Civil Rights movement never happened,\nand Cold War ended with the launch of many intercontinental ballistic nuclear weapons[5].\nWhat if Stanislav Petrov[6],\nwasn't there to save the world.\nWhat if Clair Patterson[7],\ndidn't dedicate his life to save us all.\n\nSomething as simple as choosing your own path,\nso as long as it is towards Beauty and Greatness...\nIs infinitely more important than following others, or doing what you parents want you to do,\nor getting into a good school.\nAnd you can still do all those things,\nbut you must choose a Real Education, and Informed Decision-making, and Wisdom, and the Beauty Of Your Mind above all else.\nAccepting the responsibility for a fine self education that has no equal,\nis the pass less traveled by, it is the choice that makes all the difference.\nDo not let others push you no matter how little,\nstand your ground, walk your own path, and help the world grow, and inspire others to follow.\nSoon all the people who have contributed to the many mistakes that hold us back, will fade away, retire,\nand the world, will be yours.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPSvdKTEZug\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM\n[5]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTFUqnY3E3Q\n[6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7EmLf4Xlq0\n[7]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OzYKP7s6v0",

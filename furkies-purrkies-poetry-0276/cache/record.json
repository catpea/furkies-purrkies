class=\"section\">\n  <p>Haste of organized education, threats of losing a 4.0 GPA,</p>\n  <p>homework deadlines, and even subconsciously knowing that memorization is not education, will conspire against us.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Learning for real, real education, useful knowledge,</p>\n  <p>thriving wisdom, and eventual greatness demands a beautiful and authentic existence.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In real life, getting a diploma by cramming, memorizing, winging it or getting lucky,</p>\n  <p>doesn&apos;t actually do anything.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Reality, demands real things,</p>\n  <p>truth, authenticity, and a healthy existence.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A beautiful life,</p>\n  <p>requires our full beauty.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To bloom, to truly grow up,</p>\n  <p>we need to be truly free, we need to reside in the real world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is not as easy as it sounds,</p>\n  <p>though we all have the ability to set ourselves free from childhood indoctrination.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>What about, the less obvious things?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Such as doing badly on a test some years ago, having your GPA permanently lowered because of it,</p>\n  <p>but on the day of graduation, actually being able to perfectly pass that test, but now during graduation it being too late.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So you are accepting a lower GPA, so that you can graduate sooner?</p>\n  <p>that is not how reality works, and what about the extra motivation that you would receive from keeping a 4.0 GPA throughout your entire stay?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And what about the quality of that test,</p>\n  <p>and what about the people that passed it because they memorized it without really learning anything?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And what about the fact that that many will never need what was on that test,</p>\n  <p>in effect the College or University slowing their progress down, distracting them from learning what would help them become more of themselves.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And what about well connected and ingratiated liars, at the company you do end up working at,</p>\n  <p>what if after years of tests and textbooks and frightening and stressful debt, a liar dislikes you?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Reality, will make you strong and beautiful, it will make your life meaningful and full of joy,</p>\n  <p>but you have to keep it real, the education must be real, your place of employment must be stable and honest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At no point should you be pushed to the side,</p>\n  <p>and forced to walk a path that is different from who you are.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And do not forget, that we are granted a set amount of time,</p>\n  <p>spending more than 30 years in pursuit of school and career that isn&apos;t guaranteed to be what you need, should be a tough proposition.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now, a real education coupled with a series of business undertakings that you learn from,</p>\n  <p>and eventual launch of a successful company based on what you have learned is a lot more stable.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>So, High School, College, University and a Career,</p>\n  <p>does not hold the same guarantee that Self Education and eventually becoming a Successful Founder, does.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If you start leaning towards the Start-up Culture in High School,</p>\n  <p>you can start building your companies a lot sooner, and begin isolating and mastering the lessons that you actually need in the right sequence and at the right pace.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just for the fact that there are no bullies when you learn on your own,</p>\n  <p>and zero pressure to memorize, and zero classes that will only distract you from learning what you need, self education is better for your mental health and growing up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Cults and religions are not the only indoctrination,</p>\n  <p>they are just the ones that are trivial to catch.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>A Real University, would only feature Great Thinkers, Great Actors and Narrators,</p>\n  <p>but even so, their beautiful performances, though eye catching, would never be as perfectly fitted to you as a series of fine hand-picked audio books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even an imaginary perfect-university, cannot match the power of a collection of audio books that you can listen and re-listen stress free,</p>\n  <p>as you learn to build you companies and graduate to be able to grasp more and more complex subjects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Lets just face it, being placed in a situation where you must merely memorize things,</p>\n  <p>is a sign that you are being taken advantage of.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Learning is not about memorization,</p>\n  <p>and memorization has nothing to do with learning.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Memorization is best used in poetry,</p>\n  <p>it a way to give thanks to poets.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Even if you memorize numbers of a new language,</p>\n  <p>all you have left is a piece of information that is not yet useful.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Memorizing 100 of the most popular words in a language you are learning,</p>\n  <p>is almost dangerous as you will have trouble with correct pronunciation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To learn a new language, you are best to create a path you can navigate and expand,</p>\n  <p>watch a movie you are already familiar with in your native language, and build a transcript.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We are good at language,</p>\n  <p>just like we are good at dance, don&apos;t force it, love it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Your Knowledge is sacred,</p>\n  <p>it empowers your decision making, and helps your dreams come true.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>When someone barges in forcing you to heartlessly memorize things,</p>\n  <p>you must become very suspicious of their motives.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The world is poor, there are slick talking people out there with all kinds of issues,</p>\n  <p>sometimes they are deans, principals, teachers, and even parents.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have to find a way to learn things right,</p>\n  <p>I think we all know, that way, is not the school way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I know you are scared, bad grades, yelling parents, threat of poverty and homelessness,</p>\n  <p>but you see, that won&apos;t go away when you graduate by cramming, you are only delaying it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Moreover, by not becoming educated as soon as you can,</p>\n  <p>you become vulnerable to slick talking attackers, and shitty boyfriends.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is damn hard to catch a liar, so hard that we can almost assume that liars always do win,</p>\n  <p>it is because in their sickens they learn to exploit our cognitive biases.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The way to push back against manipulators,</p>\n  <p>is to become smarter than they are, and believe you me, this barely takes any effort at all.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>At most, AT MOST, 25 five audio books about modern life,</p>\n  <p>though they must all have a positive ending, they have to be happy books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>25 audio books is like a month of your life,</p>\n  <p>and, and, and if I may, it will be one of the most beautiful times of your life.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You will always return to where you were as you read them,</p>\n  <p>so you better go to a nice place, or get in your car get on the longest highway and drive.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You can either start your life with a heart break,</p>\n  <p>or with adventure and audio books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Grab your friends, tell them to behave,</p>\n  <p>and go together.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>If I may make a suggestion, lease stop at every antique store,</p>\n  <p>as neat as the knickknacks are going to be, look for the most worn out books.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I found a saintly copy of Robinson Crusoe,</p>\n  <p>it fits in my back pocket so perfectly, I can&apos;t even.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Look for Jack London, Herman Melville, Daniel Defoe,</p>\n  <p>and keep an eye out for works by Friedrich Nietzsche.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Use the paper versions to practice narration, but listen to the audio books,</p>\n  <p>they are often out on Librivox.org for free as most of the classics are in public domain.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>That is all you need, to create an adventure,</p>\n  <p>a path to somewhere far that hits as many antique stores as you can drive by.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And promise to drive carefully,</p>\n  <p>you are not in a hurry.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Now, not everyone is ready to write,</p>\n  <p>but some of you are a lot further along than you think.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Begin by writing a singe compound sentence at a time,</p>\n  <p>and that&apos;s it, don&apos;t press, flow.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Just like dehydration happens, or we sometimes develop vitamin deficiencies,</p>\n  <p>and need to pay extra attention to what we put in our bodies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>My friends, same goes for our minds,</p>\n  <p>fear or anxiety will cause you harm, you are not to live in fear of any kind.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Do you know what the symptoms of anxiety are?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Impatience, snapping at small things, thinning hair, wanting to be alone,</p>\n  <p>sadness, brain fog, body aches, fatigue, bad sleep habits.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>These are not things that we can fix, you can&apos;t take pain killers for body aches from from fear.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>By calling it adventure, I give you a simple choice to make,</p>\n  <p>but it is more than a simple adventure, I am inviting you on a quest away from the toxic sludge of an unexamined life.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In a way, psychology is a young science,</p>\n  <p>it is also the most humble and loving of all the Daughters of Philosophy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>There aren&apos;t too many answers here,</p>\n  <p>but there is something, and I can fit it in a sentence for you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The secret to a long and healthy life is:</p>\n  <p>Happiness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I am asking you to move away from fear and other disorders that create countless issues,</p>\n  <p>and get on a path towards happiness, because that is a very powerful medicine.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Happiness is quite a thing,</p>\n  <p>it is almost on par with wisdom, though I suppose it the end it is one and the same.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Where wisdom makes you a beautiful writer,</p>\n  <p>happiness makes you a powerful doctor.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The low key sarcastic, low brow, poker face, dead pan nonsense,</p>\n  <p>that will feature in your journals due to Happiness and Love of Life.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Has the power to bring the most boorish and scared person from the brink of death,</p>\n  <p>and plop them in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, walking stick in one hand and a bewildered companion in the other.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>I once wondered how we could describe the most powerful beings on earth,</p>\n  <p>and somehow I came up with a two word description that still frightens-me-a-little to this day:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The Laughing Philosopher.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>While, I guess, I am not a real doctor, though the results are not quite in yet,</p>\n  <p>I am certain that even those who are deeply sad will find something that will bring them a special kind of Happiness when out on an adventure.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And I would argue, that the saddest of us, are the least likely to be eaten by a bobcat,</p>\n  <p>or dragged away by a condor.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And I know for certain, that the saddest of us,</p>\n  <p>are the ones that eventually tell the happiest and most triumphant of stories.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>All you need to do, is be aware of the terrible fact,</p>\n  <p>that the first few days of your adventure will feel wrong; you have to snarl through it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Fight the urge to turn the car around,</p>\n  <p>that is just the toxic sludge within you fighting for survival, make sure it loses the battle.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It will only take a few days,</p>\n  <p>and then, everything changes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Oh my, when you get out of your car,</p>\n  <p>and your hiking or trail running shoes hit the gravel, it is like hearing bells of kissing a hundred woodland faeries.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>By taking that first detoxified step of your new adventure away from lies, bullies, limits and fears,</p>\n  <p>you can perfectly understand why dogs get zoomies sometimes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>And hearing your first chipmunk,</p>\n  <p>will absolutely put all the damn birds to shame.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <hr>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>No job, or school, or employer, or alarm clock with a creepy snooze button, or any damn thing,</p>\n  <p>has any right to your joy of life - do you hear me?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You joy of life is sacred,</p>\n  <p>everything else has to be secondary.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You are at your most beautiful, and you contribute to the world the most,</p>\n  <p>when you are Happy, and occasionally mischievous.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Call it an adventure, or intellectual hygiene,</p>\n  <p>but keep your backpack by the door, and may you be always ready, for the call of the wild.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Because that will mark the rise of your own personal University,</p>\n  <p>and the beginning of your quest for real education and wisdom.</p>\n</div>",

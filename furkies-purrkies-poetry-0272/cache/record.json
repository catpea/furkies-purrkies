  "text": "If something is wrong somewhere,\nyou are not the only one to care.\nThere are others that will fight beside you,\nso as long as your cause is just and true.\nSome will fight by subtle analogy,\nlearn from them, and their lack of apology.\nSpeaking out will set you free,\neven though many will come to disagree.\nOur lives are unfortunately much too short,\nbut good things will come and you'll find comfort.\nWe are afforded a handful of miracles,\nand those certainly will aid to your cause.\nMost importantly remember to just speak out,\nthe change is up to the people that you bring about.\nYour voice is one but a million is required,\nso only speak, and never go past getting tired.\nWhatever it is that you will say,\ndo not forget about Love not even for a day.\n\nPersonal Note,\nI seem to babble on about many things,\nbut the first wrong that hurt me was school.\nSo when I think about helping the world grow,\nthe first thing that comes to mind is fixing it.\nI am really worried about the ease,\nwith which we can be indoctrinated into false beliefs.\n\nI mean we are all born into a world\nwith intercontinental ballistic missiles pointed at all cities.\nWe accept this all to easily,\nmost of us never pays any attention.\nThe mechanism behind our blind acceptance.\nis also the same mechanism that may launch them someday.\nTo really see all the things we need to fix,\nwe have to wiggle ourselves out of any and all indoctrinations.\n\nOne of our most powerful superpowers,\nis thinking by subtle analogy to something else.\nThat is one of the mechanisms that powers our wisdom,\nwe can see or solve problems based on other things we find in books.\nThere are three people that influenced my ideas about education the most,\nRichard Dawkins[1], Erica Goldson[2], and the Saintly Sir Ken Robinson[3].\nWhen I look at them, I feel like I copied everything from them,\nbut that's just means we are all fighting toward similar goals.\nThe thing that sticks out about me is this notion of wisdom,\nI absolutely believe that we are all great thinkers that eventually become wise.\nAnd unlike Sir Robinson who urges to reform,\nor Miss Godson who want to work together.\nI mostly want to encourage students to stop trusting schools,\nand accept the responsibility for their own education.\nI do not think that being bombarded by mixtures of lessons and homework,\nis good for learning, I think it only induces cramming, and renders a student uneducated.\nSir Robinson mentions,\nthat there is a small percentage of students that do thrive in school.\nBut you see what Erica Goldson is saying,\nshe's is only good at passing tests, and she's scared.\nRichard Dawkins is a scientist who urges people,\nto focus on the The Magic of Reality, rather than any other magic.\nThe way he takes to the stage,\nand the way he moves an audience.\nHis dignity and certainty of knowing-that he is correct,\nand that he is helping the world grow, is an perfect example of a Great Being.\nThe title of this text,\ncomes from a question asked by a young [presumably religions] lady: \"What if you're wrong?[4]\"\nI urge you to look it up on the internet to hear his response,\nand to see what a being hoping to help the world grow really looks like.\nOne of the most heartbreakingly powerful things that comes to my mind in regards to his work,\nis him visiting a school where children are being indoctrinated into the belief that Noah and his Ark are absolutely real[5].\nThese children can't know otherwise,\nit becomes their very reality.\n \nReferences\n[1]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Richard+Dawkins\n[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M4tdMsg3ts\n[3]: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Sir+Ken+Robinson\n[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mmskXXetcg\n[5]: https://youtu.be/uQ7GvwUsJ7w?t=3450",

 <p>and Free Tutors, a Real Education.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It will take a psychologist to identify those who need help,</p>\n  <p>it is as simple as that.</p>\n</div>\n<div

themselves in the amount of debt that nobody will come to collect.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Prevention, is really about education,</p>\n  <p>because an educated person can make a lot more than any government can grant them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Social Programs, Real Welfare, or Universal Basic Income,</p>\n  <p>will grant a person a Home, a Car, Food, and all the necessities, but they can&apos;t pay for extras.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>They&apos;ll pay for an education leading up to a Captains License,</p>\n  <p>but not the

immense fear and suffering,</p>\n  <p>suffering that draws those who have the courage to keep fighting into addiction so that they don&apos;t burst out of pain.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>To get there, to begin growing up as a civilization,</p>\n  <p>those of us who can handle it must take to Books and Audio Books and reach Wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Only in your Wisdom can the world begin growing,</p>\n  <p>beyond the noisy mess that desperate, blind and tone deaf career politicians created.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The youngest of you are going to inherit all these problems,</p>\n  <p>but you will also know that all of these problems are happening due to lack of wisdom.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Treat the

<p>Personal Note,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Those of you who are just learning about the world,</p>\n  <p>know that it is confusing because hardly anything works right.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Be it a be it a Judge, or General, and most shockingly a Jury,</p>\n  <p>they are missing lessons that help them see the world as a Work in Progress.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>We are still building the foundation,</p>\n  <p>and we are getting too much interference from our leadership.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Look no further than the complete loss of privacy,</p>\n  <p>this is a function of uneducation and desperation, and blindness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>Enhanced interrogation, is even a more terrifying example,</p>\n  <p>the world has no faith in nations that practice torture.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>The 13th Amendment to Constitution of United States did not end Slavery in Full</p>\n  <p>it reads &quot;Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>You have a lot of work on your hands,</p>\n  <p>and you will have a lot of friends working just as hard as you, and all over the world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>While you are still young, take to Adventure Audio Books,</p>\n  <p>read them all, and especially pay attention to the part where the adventurer reveals the reason for this quest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>In less than a Hundred Audio Books that call to you,</p>\n  <p>you will begin becoming wise onward to becoming a great being.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n  <p>It is in it self a great adventure,</p>\n  <p>and if I may, a Memoir is best written as your life unfolds, it is never too early to start writing.</p>\n</div>",

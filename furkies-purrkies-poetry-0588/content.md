Each of the three principlas I had knew schools were not working,
I think the teachers also knew, they are smart, cunning, and constantly exposed to the system and students.

There are also teachers that try to be helpful,
both [Erica Goldson][goldson] and [Adam Saenz][saenz] mention them.

But you know how it is,
it is not enough.

Schools aren't' just making money off of processing students,
they are also preventing them from flourishing by tricking them that grades are a measure of a being.

The gravity of this situation is such,
that there is no time to parade some minority of teachers as proof, or hope.

The world needs to put life changing books first, followed by meaningful self education,
and fantasy education along with fairy tales of magical powers of bullshit diplomas, last.

As you grow older and notice more and more things bout the world and its culture,
you discover things in your past that were beyond your comprehension.

Teachers don't care at all, they give you grades based on your other classes,
they just want to keep their job get paid, and will never question the curriculum.

Ms. Shinfluenza with all the things she said to you, never actually cared,
she was simply navigating the situation in such a way as to cause the least amount of trouble.

She didn't want to get called into the office, she didn't want you to look at her wrong,
she didn't want any kind of friction, if that meant being unfair, that was just fine with her.

They know school is bad, they know the curriculum is incomprehensible garbage,
they may even know that you can't possibly learn things that are disconnected.

And they certainly know about the kids in the library using drugs before the finals,
they don't care if you become an addict by jumping their hoops.

In their mind, it is your life your choice - well that's not entirely true...
they also help in diagnosing students as having learning disorders.

This way the student's who just can't handle it,
get on the same drugs that the kids in the library use to uselessly and temporarily improve their short term memory.

Many are more likely to threaten, yeall, manipulate, cheat, steal, and pump the students with drugs,
then to fix the curriculum, or help the student's learn in a sequence that fits them best.

---

And of course they know that they are convincing perfectly normal students that they are below average,
as in not as smart as the other kids, other kids that are temporary memorizing as ordered.

---

See there is no such thing as an F-student, the only reason why grades exist,
is because it is easy to show that they are doing something.

There is a curriculum that covers easy to regurgitate topics, a test that test memorization,
and grades that the teacher shows, that the class quote worked, unquote.

And they use tests, because of their compatibility with memorization,
if they tested comprehension, everyone would fail, and the fraud would be revealed.

---

This way, you ace Biology, but don't actually know Biology,
you get an A in physics, an A in chemistry, and A in Math, A in music class...

and you totally nail Excel class,
just in case you become a secretary.

But it is all, fake, including excel,
you are supposed to know how to make your own excel.

Which is about cell dependencies and updating everything when a number changes somewhere,
and what a [wonderful introduction to UI frameworks][UI] that would be.

Which brings us to the core of the problem,
not only are you tricked due to your own lack of familiarity with he subject.

But the teacher doesn't know the subject for real,
[if they did they wouldn't be a teacher][sad].

They memorized the curriculum,
and some extra side facts by being around the things they teach, but that is all.

Teachers are not allowed to convince you that you are not smart just because you don't want to learn things that are irrelevant to you, or learn in the sequence they dictate.
because that destroys the future.

I call this one the theft of dreams,
the dreams that we didn't know to have.

An Unknown Unknown, is used to trick you into accepting vapor,
in place of real knowledge as you are not going to protest missing out on the things that you don't know about.

This is yet another mechanism that cults use to use people, to control their minds, to drain them,
the way to punch through this, or hack through it, is yet again to consume a pleasant m√©lange of a thousand biographies.

---

Again, no one book has anything to do with any other book,
to say "She reads books" is to utter something as meaningless as:

"Her hair has a color",
or when asked "What music do you listen to" responding with "The music on my computer".

A book is a storage medium, it is a data format,
the fact that something is a book has nothing to do with its content.

The best kind of book is one that you can listen to,
and best of those are beautifully performed by great voice actors.

Go to the library and ask them what apps they use for narrated books,
they will give you free access, though you will need to deal with wait lists.

Figure out what the unknown unknowns are,
listen to every biography you can find.

  <p>Here I will ask you to slow down where it comes to color,<br>but I also present an obvious shortcut in the end, both ways will have you learning in a jiffy.</p>
  <p>Color combinations are all around you,<br>but you need to discover and catalog them.</p>
  <p>And then create your artworks in harmony,<br>with the colors that speak the most.</p>
  <p>One of the horrible tragedies of school,<br>are those cheap pre-mixed paints, they speak nothing.</p>
  <p>They attack art,<br>they hurt it.</p>

  <p>Long before you move beyond Graphite and<br>coloring with the gentle beauty of Coffee and Tea.</p>
  <p>You need to begin keeping a journal of colors,<br>don't make difficult mixtures.</p>
  <p>Make sure that you dot next to your color,<br>what you have mixed, so that you can re-create the colors, without guessing.</p>
  <p>As you go through your day,<br>pay attention to color combinations around you.</p>
  <p>If you find something interesting try capturing it in your color journal,<br>you buy a mini watercolor kit with all the classical colors and keep it near by.</p>

  <p>Alas, speed they slowly towards color,<br>the world of mixing color is a world of poetry.</p>
  <p>Worlds of poetry can not be hurried,<br>they have to come to you.</p>
  <p>If you are not sure which colors go where,<br>then don't paint, yet, just let the under-painting be.</p>

  <p>Note that colors are best added, slowly and in layers,<br>so that you can keep watching your art develop.</p>
  <p>Watercolors for example are a high precision instrument,<br>because you create the color semi-transparent layer by semi-transparent layer.</p>
  <p>You don't paint with the color you need,<br>you apply transparent layers of color until they stack up to give you the color you wanted.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there are these impossibly beautiful color combinations,<br>Purple & Orange Gold, White Pearl & Raging Red, Shining Gold & Scarlet, Green Pea & Leaf Brown, Sad Teal and Lost Pink.</p>
  <p>And when you create your portrait around those colors,<br>the colors will have their own say.</p>
  <p>They will add a harmony,<br>that delivers your art.</p>
  <p>There are colors that make no sense,<br>they may go together, they may be the colors in your reference or subject, but they speak, nothing.</p>
  <p>And I hate to say it,<br>but they should be avoided.</p>
  <p>Don't use colors that have nothing to add to your art,<br>or have no reason to be in your art, use only those combinations that go together</p>

  <p>The people that know color well, are the <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/graffiti">Graffiti Artists</a>,<br><a href="https://cgsociety.org/hall-of-fame/editorpicks">3D Graphic Designers</a>, and <a href="https://dribbble.com/">Computer Art Designers</a>.</p>
  <p>You can see different artists, and unique artworks,<br>reusing the same color combinations.</p>
  <p>Precisely, because,<br>the selection of color is an art in it self.</p>
  <p>Before you use color in your art,<br>you have to learn to observe it.</p>
  <p>Perhaps, create a catalog of color,<br>which maybe you could share with the world - and what a beautiful poster that would make.</p>
  <p>By the time you discover you are ready,<br>you won't need to think of primary colors and opposites for mixing.</p>
  <p>You'll have your own,<br>much more precise ways that make you colors glow.</p>

  <p>But is is also OK to hurry,<br>so as long as you stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
  <p>And that is my shortcut,<br>copy colors of artists that speak well with them.</p>
  <p>So as long as you know that color selection is an art,<br>and that your combinations have to be meaningful.</p>
  <p>So as long as you don't get stuck,<br>just picking whatever colors your models wore, or subjects were painted with, you'll be OK.</p>
  <p>Another way to think about it is,<br>this:</p>
  <p>When you find something you like,<br>don't pay attention to the color it has...</p>
  <p>But instead ask, which of the precious color combinations that I love,<br>would make this portrait or painting even better.</p>
  <p>And then make a dozen little miniatures and sketches,<br>and just try them out, your sketches, also become a work of art.</p>
  <p>Consider framing your sketches,<br>or maybe just sketch on a large poster, that then can hang at the gallery next to your painting.</p>
  <p>You search for subject and color harmony,<br>is sure to tell a beautiful story.</p>
  <p>Finally, once you find the harmony of subject & color,<br>then you are well on your way to a new masterpiece.</p>
